462,462,567,"Votes, Deployment and Now Parenthood in the Middle of a Pandemic","
WASHINGTON — As lawmakers gathered in the well of the House in the early hours of March 14 to vote on a sweeping coronavirus relief bill, Representative Max Rose, Democrat of New York, felt that the pandemic that had already begun spreading through the ranks of Congress was about to upend life as he knew it.
Hundreds of miles away in New York, his wife Leigh Rose, unaware that votes had finished just before 1 a.m., was frantically calling him, and then his roommate, Representative Jared Golden, Democrat of Maine, to let him know that his life was about to change in a much different way.
“Buddy!” Mr. Rose recalled Mr. Golden saying when he finally tracked Mr. Rose down. “You’re having a kid.”
The baby the Roses had long planned to adopt was about to be born, three weeks early. Now, the pair is navigating the first months of parenthood in the middle of a pandemic, figuring out how to secure formula and diapers in a shuttered city — all while Mr. Rose juggles trips back and forth from Washington to vote. In the middle of it all, the first-term congressman from Staten Island deployed for two weeks with the National Guard to assist with coronavirus relief.
“Think about this world that he’s been brought into, startlingly different than the world was just several months before,” Mr. Rose said of his newborn son. “We just really want him to be safe, and happy, and healthy. It’s scary.”
“But what a story of his birth,” he added.The prospect of parenthood had been simmering beneath the tumultuous events of Mr. Rose’s freshman term: a month after he took office during the nation’s longest government shutdown, the couple began pursuing the adoption process. The months of arduous paperwork and uncertainty continued through Mr. Rose’s adjustment to a weekly commute between Staten Island and Washington, and a summer of congressional investigations.
In November, as the impeachment inquiry consumed Capitol Hill, the couple learned they had been matched with a birth mother, whom they declined to identify out of respect for her privacy, and began preparing to welcome their baby in April. But in the wee hours of a Saturday morning in March, as Mr. Rose voted on coronavirus relief legislation, Ms. Rose learned that their son was about to be born right then. She jumped in her car and drove through the night to reach New England.
Miles Benjamin Rose was born at 2 a.m., and Mr. Rose got the first flight out of Washington later that day to meet his son.
“There’s so many families that are going through exactly what we’re going through — I mean with newborns with young children at home,” Ms. Rose said. “We’re definitely not alone.”
As the couple drove back to New York with their son, the city had begun to completely shutter to stem the spread of the virus. They agreed that Mr. Rose, an Afghanistan combat veteran who is a captain in the Army National Guard, should deploy to help with the city’s response to the pandemic. He was the first member of Congress to do so, citing a desire to take a more personal role in providing relief to his constituents.
It was a decision that kept Mr. Rose physically apart from Ms. Rose and Miles for a month, during the deployment and then the mandated two-week isolation period to ensure that Mr. Rose had not contracted the coronavirus.
“It was the right thing to do,” Mr. Rose said. “It was important to serve in this capacity at this moment.”
“Everybody is sacrificing far more than we have,” he added, pointing to the doctors and nurses he met who were isolating in basements or hotels for far longer periods of time to protect their families and maintain their work.
Ms. Rose acknowledged the challenge of the circumstances, but added: “There’s so many people that are struggling, and it’s so important for Max to take care of the people in our district.”
In the moments when Mr. Rose could come home during his deployment, he would eat dinner on the trunk of their car in the garage — 10 feet away from where Ms. Rose would stand with the baby. But then Mr. Rose had to isolate himself for another two weeks, keeping him from holding Miles, who is just starting to coo and smile, until Friday.
The pair has also tapped into the growing network of parents on Capitol Hill with young children. They ticked off a list of Mr. Rose’s Democratic colleagues — Representatives Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Pete Aguilar of California, Josh Gottheimer, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Antonio Delgado of New York among them — and their spouses, who have repeatedly checked in on the couple in recent days.
“I lean on them — they understand the experiences that we have,” said Ms. Rose, who recently joined a Zoom call with a dozen congressional spouses to check in.
It remains unclear, they said, how the couple will handle Mr. Rose’s trips to Washington, where coronavirus cases continue to escalate. The House is expected to return the week of May 11. Mr. Rose said having a newborn at home had only intensified his desire to institute a remote voting policy in times of emergency, to ease the burden on congressional families.
And the work on Capitol Hill and its consequences, he said, have become even more personal for him now that he is a father.
“We’re going to continue to find joy in our family, and the little moments each and every day,” Mr. Rose said. “And that joy and that optimism and that hope is even more important right now, because when we say that we’re all in this together, it’s our family with everyone else’s.”",1

Sayer Ji reports on a new NPR investigation which reveals that despite $660 million in federal spending to set up 30+ field hospitals for the anticipated catastrophic case load from COVID-19, most of the emergency field hospitals had ZERO patients.

The implications of this NPR report are profound, revealing that the dominant mainstream narrative about COVID-19's catastrophic burden on the US healthcare system never materialized. As reported on May 7th, 2020,

""As hospitals were overrun by coronavirus patients in other parts of the world, the Army Corps of Engineers mobilized in the U.S., hiring private contractors to build emergency field hospitals around the country. The endeavor cost more than $660 million, according to an NPR analysis of federal spending records. But nearly four months into the pandemic, most of these facilities haven't treated a single patient.""

The statistics reveal a striking contrast between the official narrative of hospitals overrun with patients and bodies piling up and the reality of how overblown the crisis was from the beginning.

1404,1412,2009,"Police in Hamburg use WATER CANNONS to disperse demonstrators against anti-lockdown protest (VIDEO, PHOTOS)","Police have deployed water cannons to break up a sparse crowd demonstrating against a sanctioned anti-lockdown rally in Hamburg, Germany, that saw dozens turn out while minding social distancing rules.

Police had to intervene after a small group of about 120 counter-protesters, many of them clad in black hoodies, repeatedly ignored police requests to stay clear of the ‘Vigil for the Basic Law’ rally against the lockdown measures on Saturday.

The counter-demonstrators, who showed up unannounced, lacking any permission from the authorities, argued that the anti-lockdown rally attracted many right-wing extremists. “Against conspiracy fantasies, anti-semites and the right-wing agenda,” one of the posters read.

Although both rallies ended without a major incident, scuffles broke out between police and counter-protesters. A bottle was hurled at the officers from the crowd, police said. One person was arrested but was released later.

The anti-lockdown gathering was greenlit to go ahead after organizers agreed to cap the number of its participants at 750 instead of some 3,500-4,000, as originally requested. The Hamburg Administrative Court ruled to limit the number of those who could join the rally so police would be able to enforce the social distancing guidelines, imposed to stem the coronavirus pandemic.

Less than 20 minutes after the meeting officially kicked off, at about 3:17 p.m. local time, the maximum allowed number of participants had already arrived, police said, noting that it had to block more people from coming.

The demonstrators stood several feet apart from each other, chanting slogans and holding anti-lockdown banners, some of which read: “The right to distance instead of a ban on contacts,” “Free accessible tests for everybody instead of the quarantine for everybody” as well as “Stop the corona madness! Basic law now!”

The participants of the rally denounced the government’s response to the outbreak, which has seen some 177,850 testing positive for Covid-19, including 8,216 who have died as a result of the disease.

One of the speakers at the rally argued that more people have died due to planned surgeries being postponed than from the virus itself. There have also been calls to make future vaccinations voluntary, although the authorities have never said that the coronavirus shot would be mandatory.

Several dozen rallies for and against the lockdown measures were also held in Berlin, including outside the Reichstag building, home to the German parliament.

Weniger ""#Hygienedemos"", mehr Gegendemos heute in #Berlin - die jedoch nicht alle vernünftiger waren.

That gathering also prompted a counter-action, with demonstrators branding those opposing the coronavirus restrictions “tin foil hats” and “Nazis.” Some 1000 police were deployed to ensure social distancing. In the wake of the protests, some 180 people faced administrative and criminal charges for violating the restrictions, including The Infectious Diseases Protection Act, police said.

696,696,852,"As elective surgeries resume, out-of-state patients flock to Illinois doctors","Robin Treider and her husband set out Tuesday on a 10-hour drive from their home in Pennsylvania to Oak Brook, where she was set to undergo a long overdue knee replacement surgery just two days after Illinois hospitals resumed elective procedures.

Though Treider said she wasn’t concerned about stepping into a hospital in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, it still felt at times like she was riding an “emotional roller coaster.”

“It’s just the normal fears that can pop into your mind of the things that could go wrong,” she said. “And you quickly try to push them away, but they come back.”

Treider is just one of the patients traveling to Illinois to see Dr. Richard Berger of Rush Hospital, one of the first orthopedic surgeons in the Chicago area. While Pennsylvania restarted elective surgeries April 27, Treider said she was willing to wait for Illinois to lift its restrictions because Berger was highly recommended by a friend and she had already been in line for surgery with him.

After postponing surgeries for roughly two months when the coronavirus took hold, Berger said his schedule is now jam-packed with patients eager to go under the knife.

“They planned everything around having surgery done and finally alleviating their pain, finally restoring their function. And then for obviously good reasons, we canceled their surgery or postponed their surgery. And it’s just been heartbreaking for them,” said Berger, who estimated that roughly half of his patients come from outside Illinois.

When elective surgeries resumed Monday in Illinois, hospitals had new safeguards in place to protect patients and medical staff from the deadly virus.

At Rush Oak Brook, where Treider is undergoing surgery, those new measures include strict social distancing guidelines, screening and temperature checks and new requirements for more staff members to wear both masks and gloves. In addition, family members can no longer wait inside the hospital and patients must be tested for COVID-19 ahead of their surgery.

But Berger noted that health care workers have long been taken precautions to prevent the spread of disease. For example, he said his team wears “hermetically-sealed space suits” and performs operations in rooms that are pumped with sterile air that helps filter out “any pathogens, any bacteria [and] any virus.

“We assume every patient has something that we don’t want to get,” he said. “And we assume that no patient wants to get anything that we get.”

As surgeons like Berger have gotten back to work, the Illinois Department of Public Health has made it clear that elective surgeries could again be suspended in the case of a “rapid resurgence or a second wave of COVID-19” or a “decrease in statewide hospital COVID-19 testing levels.”

In retrospect, Berger said, it was unnecessary to shut down elective procedures, which are a vital source of revenue for hospitals. Because everyone is screened at his hospital, Berger claimed that having a joint replacement surgery is currently safer than going to a grocery store or a gas station.

“We were thinking this was going to be Armageddon,” he said. “We thought the hospital would be 100% filled and overspilled. McCormick Place made a makeshift hospital that was going to be filled. Well, it turned out there was no patients that ever went there. Our hospital wasn’t filled. No other hospital was filled.

“Now thank God, of course, but we were wrong.”

Meanwhile, as Treider prepared for her operation on Wednesday morning, her concerns about the procedure have been allayed by her confidence in Berger. An avid tennis player, Treider can’t wait to get the surgery done so she can get back on the court this summer.

“I’m going to be walking around in happy tears,” she said.",1
55,55,93,Coronavirus: Theater Wit’s ‘remote viewing’ aims to be the first of its kind,"Chicago’s entertainment industry has seen one cancellation and/or postponement after another due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

A prominent member of the Belmont Theatre District wants to keep the shows going — and make sure the cast and crew is compensated.

While Theatre Wit, 1229 W. Belmont Ave. in the Lake View neighborhood, has suspended all in-person seating for its shows, the creative team behind “Teenage Dick” is ready to unveil “remote viewing” for the reimagining of Richard III, the disabled main character from William Shakespeare’s play.

Remote viewing starts Wednesday. Here’s how it works:

Viewers buy a ticket for their desired date and time — same as always.

Viewers receive an email with a private, personalized URL and password to watch a recorded performance on Vimeo at the specified date and time. The recording, shot Monday, was edited to provide close-ups and full coverage of the staging.

There are only 98 viewing streams — the same number as Theater Wit’s capacity— available for every performance.

At the end of every performance, viewers are invited to join the cast and fellow audience members for a live post-show discussion over video conference.

The show, which can be viewed on a computer, smartphone or tablet, could be seen as a refuge from the dire situation for theater companies, many of which are asking ticketed consumers to donate the price of their tickets rather than ask for a full refund.

Director Mike Lew’s play portrays Dick, a class president candidate with cerebral palsy, maneuvering the brutal politics of high school. Remote viewer tickets are $28.

Theater Wit’s original response to the coronavirus scare was to continue live performances of “Teenage Dick” but limit seating and also sell tickets to watch a live stream remotely. That was before Gov. J.B. Pritzker ordered all bars and restaurants to close to the public at end of business day on Monday.

“After the governor’s announcement, if you can’t gather in a bar or restaurant, you can’t gather in a theater; he didn’t say ‘theater’ but I can read the spirit of it,” said Jeremy Wechsler, Theater Wit’s artistic director. “You can see what’s happened in other countries. ... We were supposed to open, you are concerned that people aren’t gonna get to see the work.”

Next, Wechsler, who described ticket sales as “not bad,” put together a plan looping in the actors and their union, with something that would be fair to the well-being of the actors.

He hopes the play can be viewed as a potential national model for theater companies who hope to continue on during the pandemic.

“We’ve already reduced the amount of physical contact between actors, as much as the script allows,” Wechsler said. “After today [Monday], I think there’s a real ethical concern about gathering a group of technicians and actors together in one space, you know. We’re going to go into social isolation here, so I don’t know how many theaters you are able to get to do this.

When the theaters are allowed to reopen, Teenage Dick’s cast will return to perform the show live and in-person, theater officials said. And, more important, the cast/crew will be paid the full performance rates for the duration of the run.

Monday’s performance that took place in front of a private audience of 40, was for social distancing, according to theater officials.

Theater Wit isn’t the only local theater house that’s experimenting with unorthodox practices. Annoyance Theatre has created a GoFundMe account called a “Countdown to Quarantine” to raise funds to live-stream a show that highlights how nine people, locked inside the theater at 851 W. Belmont, interact while being quarantined during a pandemic. The 10-day process will culminate in a live-streamed original show directed by artistic director Mick Napier.",1
102,102,149,Nature can help restore us as we deal with coronavirus,"As a society, we are experiencing a period of unprecedented stress and uncertainty. But nature can be a guide to us at this time, providing a model of cooperation, a place to heal, and ways to connect, even at the recommended distance.

Opinion

In nature, cooperation abounds.

As author Peter Wohlleben, of “The Hidden Life of Trees” explored, “[trees] send distress signals about drought and disease, for example, or insect attacks, and other trees alter their behavior when they receive these messages.” While social distancing feels like a sacrifice now, the stay at home order has saved countless lives, from high-risk populations to medical and service professionals. Altering our behavior at this critical time, just as nature does in the face of challenges, is community resilience in action.

Even at a safe distance, nature heals.

One study after another documents its positive effects on physical and mental health for people of all ages and backgrounds. Nature offers balm and solace to the weary — being a source of beauty, wonder, and inspiration. And nature can be found everywhere — including in the trees outside your apartment or home.

Nature connects us.

Looking out your window you can see it, as the birds have begun their grand migration through our region. Living in a major flyway, residents can experience this annual spectacle, just as those thousands of miles away experienced it, reminding us just how interconnected we are.

As we collectively wade through this worldwide pandemic, nature’s resilience should serve as our guide. Through collective cooperation, connection and healing, we will overcome this moment and thrive as nature blooms today.

It is only right that we take this time to reconnect with it.

1397,1404,1961,Dr. Fauci taken to task as COVID-19 narrative swings wildly – again [Video],"Anybody who has been following the story about the coronavirus pandemic is hopefully aware of the constantly changing double, triple, quadruple and n-speak that the “experts” give us concerning the need for social distancing, wearing masks, not touching each other, and in America, especially about not being together in “non essential” places like… church. All of this has been more or less led and spurred on by one Dr. Anthony Fauci. We reported three weeks ago on some rather amazing accounts suggesting that this doctor was somehow connected to the research programs in a “chimeric virus” containing strains of SARS, HIV and other goodies to produce a supervirus – one that is incurable. That research program was ongoing in the United States before the government got wind of it and shut it down, rightly so, since it was a program designed to bring about nothing but death. However, the allegation goes, Fauci managed to channel money illegally to Wuhan, China, to a lab there to further the research, and it is that virus, the causal agent of COVID-19, that we all have come to know and roundly hate.

So goes the allegation. It seems like wackadoo conspiracy theory still to me, but there is some interesting detail behind it, so it is possible that there are at least several true elements. However, Dr Fauci works for President Trump on the Coronavirus Task Force, and of late, the President has been ignoring the good doctor’s “for your own good” advice more and more. On Friday, May 22, the doctor did a reversal from his long-held course that we must be isolated until the end of time (and our media controlled) and suggested that isolation for too long may do “irreperable harm… including to our own health.”

Yeah. We knew that already. Ask anyone who has been riding this thing out in their home for the last two months. Do you feel better now? Now, granted, we have done a lot to adapt to the present pandemic, but the rhetorical churn and froth over how this is being handled, and how and what the virus itself does is such that for the last week or two, it has been extremely difficult to know what to report on here. The only constant about COVID-19 seems to be the never-ending stream of unqualified nonsense (we have stronger words for that, you know) that have everyone who tries to stay informed jumping and paranoid… or, has them finally coming to the conclusion that seems to be true:

Nobody really knows.

It would be okay if someone, anyone, in leadership said this honestly and continuously, as a preface for trying to establish some sort of common ground. We know less about COVID-19 than the experts act like, and the increasingly political nature of the handling of the pandemic is far more dramatic than the pandemic itself has turned out to be.

The video included with this article shows the response of one entertainer, Dave Portnoy, who has been skeptical of Dr Fauci’s position for a long time. After Dr. Fauci suddenly whipsawed to a different point of view (in truly Orwellian splendor, without acknowledging he was wrong), Dave does not let him get away with it.

If nothing else, the video ought to help all of us blow off some long-built-up steam.

313,313,396,Virtual fitness classes allow those in quarantine to maintain ‘normalcy’ while at home,"Hockey, lacrosse, soccer and tae kwon do kept the Millas brothers busy after school and on weekends. Then life changed in an instant.

The coronavirus pandemic prompted a statewide stay-at-home order, forcing adjustments to their out-of-the-house routines.

Lee-Ann Millas’ boys, 5 and 9, who have been practicing martial arts for the last six months at a studio in Evergreen Park, haven’t missed a beat. The switch to virtual tae kwon do training has “been a blessing.”

“It’s the only normalcy they’ve been able to have besides being at home,” Millas said.

Grandmaster Kwan Pil Kim teaches tae kwon do and hapkido in Evergreen Park. His classes are usually filled with students ranging in age from 4 to 76, but now he’s forced to perform his techniques in front of a laptop.

“At the beginning, I had a hard time because it was the first time using,” Kim said. “But after a couple of days, it was easier to join for everybody.”

He first started teaching his classes March 14 via Zoom and quickly noticed an issue with teaching martial arts techniques through a camera.

“I was confused in the beginning because [the video] is mirroring, so when I use my left hand they are using their right hand,” Kim said.

Despite the early kinks, classes have gone smoothly since the early days of the experiment, he said.

He teaches every day, following his regular class schedule. He’s even figured out a way for parents to make up for the lack of training equipment.

“I showed them how to make a kicking paddle with a plastic bag,” Kim said. “Put some air in [the bag] and tie it. That was fun.”

His biggest issue now is making sure his youngest students stay focused throughout the session.

“I have to keep them focused because everyone is at home and just looking at the screen,” Kim said.

Millas said the virtual training gives her sons “something to look forward to every day.”

“I think it’s a wonderful thing that not only is he doing for a community, but for the sanity of the kids and parents,” she said.

Kim said the online-only experience has been eye-opening for him, and he didn’t realize how easy it would be to get used to.

“It’s really cool, and especially right now it’s the only thing we can do. We have to teach new stuff, but it’s fun,” Kim said.

Rebecca Caliendo, a yoga instructor, is also holding virtual classes. She believes staying active is as beneficial for mental health as it is for physical health, especially for those who feel bombarded by coronavirus news.

“It’s not bad to feel anxiety or fear … but that has to go somewhere,” Caliendo said. “You need to let them out somehow and doing anything; walking, jumping jacks, yoga. I think that helps people.”

Caliendo started practicing yoga when she lived in New York and she sang opera for a living.

“It’s a crazy place to be. And I needed to discharge, I needed a mental health release,” she said. “I started practicing yoga, which I say kind of saved my sanity, saved my life.”

Before the statewide measure was put into place, Caliendo was holding classes in studios and gyms. She decided to take a stab at doing it online because she missed teaching and realized people were looking for their own way to discharge.

“It’s really cool because it’s physical. But then you also get to chill and relax at the end,” she said.

Caliendo’s classes are free, but she does accept donations.

She teaches all levels five days a week, with her largest class to date at 25 participants. A recent class featured a woman in her 70s who was trying yoga for the first time.

Caliendo said the meditative aspects of a yoga routine are especially helpful right now because instructors can’t adjust their students’ bodies into the right positions.

For fitness instructor Mary Younger, quarantine life has presented an opportunity for her to branch out into the digital space, a move she put off for too long.

“I’ve had a lot of people over the years ask me if I have a tape that I could sell or a DVD,” she said. “This coronavirus era has forced me to do what people have been asking me to do in the first place.”

A couple of days before the stay-at-home order was announced, Younger experimented with her first couple of streams.

“I did a 30-minute step aerobics class and did a 30-minute cardio kickboxing class. The feedback was awesome. I mean, it was great.”

Encouraged by the responses, Younger increased her online workouts. Now she streams her routines three times a week on Facebook live.

The frustrating part, she says, is not being able to feed off of the energy of her students or motivate those who need a little encouragement during a workout.

But the benefits of staying active when you’re cooped up inside outweigh any inconveniences, Younger said.

“I don’t care how wonderful your apartment or your house is with a great balcony and backyard,” she said. “Staying fit is a positive distraction. With all this going on, it makes you feel good about yourself to take care of yourself.”",1
1103,1103,1329,"COVID-19: Better health system data, resilience and priority setting","Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1
1120,1120,1361,"Incarcerated in worst federal prison for COVID-19, Death Row Records founder asks for compassionate release","LOMPOC — A federal judge is expected to decide within weeks whether to free Michael “Harry-O” Harris, the incarcerated former Los Angeles cocaine kingpin who financed the creation of Death Row Records in the 1990s.

For Harris, 58, this is only the latest attempt for a release. For decades, he has been incarcerated in federal and state prison for various convictions related to a massive international cocaine trafficking he built in the 1980s, which at its peak generated an estimated $2 million per day. But unlike many in his situation, Harris has the backing not just of justice reform advocates, but law enforcement members and elected officials, who have lobbied for his freedom in recent years.

Harris is currently incarcerated in Federal Correctional Institution Lompoc, where his federal sentence is set to end in October 2028. It is a prison complex that has gained national notoriety for its failure to contain COVID-19; with more than 1,700 cases and 10 fatalities, the prison was recently sued by the ACLU over its handling of the pandemic.

According to court filings by Harris’ legal team, Harris is afflicted with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a disease where the body’s immune system attacks the nerves, which can lead to full-blown paralysis. This, combined with the coronavirus outbreak, adds up to an “imminent threat” to Harris’ health if he is not released, his attorneys argued.

“If Mr. Harris were to become critically ill or die while in custody, it would be not only devastating from a human standpoint for Mr. Harris and his family, but would eliminate a person who, following his release, would in all probability serve as a great source of healing and mentoring in the disadvantaged community of South Central Los Angeles in which he was raised,” Harris’ attorneys, Matthew Lombard and Bruce Zucker, wrote in a motion for compassionate release.

On top of that, Harris’ motion argues that the U.S. Marshal service miscalculated Harris’ federal sentence when he was sentenced to federal and state terms in the early 90s, and that Harris would be a free man today if not for their mistake.

In its response, the U.S. Attorney’s office argues on technical legal terms that Harris should be ineligible for a judge-ordered compassionate release because he still has a pending administrative appeal for release. They also argue that staff at Lompoc have taken “aggressive” measures to reduce the further spread of COVID-19 in the facility, including testing the entire inmate population.

“None of (Harris’) arguments, including those related to COVID-19, justify a permanent, irrevocable reduction in his sentence,” assistant U.S. Attorneys with the Central District of California wrote in a response motion. They later added that, ” Many of the defendant’s allegations are based on his mischaracterization of the record and downplaying his material involvement in drug trafficking activities.”

It was unclear when a judge will rule on the motion. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr. ordered Harris’ attorneys to file a 20-page reply to the federal government’s response by May 22, according to court records.

The coronavirus outbreak in the Lompoc prison complex — which comprises two federal prisons — is widely considered the worst of any federal jail or prison, nationwide. Its number of confirmed cases has grown exponentially, nearly doubling from May 11 to May 17, according to published reports.

At FCI Lompoc, where Harris stays, roughly 80 percent of the 1,162 inmates have tested positive for the virus. There have been 10 fatalities.

Late last week, the ACLU filed a class-action suit on behalf of Lompoc inmates, accusing the prison of “deliberate indifference” to stopping the spread of the virus. The Bureau of Prisons has not publicly responded to the suit.

Harris’ career and public persona

Harris is famous for financing the start of Death Row Records in the early 1990s, investing $1.5 million in a partnership with the label’s co-founder Marion “Suge” Knight. The two formed a parent company for Death Row Records known as Godfather Entertainment, but business disputes between Knight and Harris ultimately curbed the partnership. In the 1990s, Death Row Records produced numerous classic rap albums, including Snoop Doggy’s Doggystyle and 2pac’s best-selling record during his life, All Eyez on Me.

Harris also co-founded the Houston-based Rap-a-Lot Records, and funded the Broadway play Checkmates, starring Denzel Washington.

In the late 1980s, Harris was convicted of attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder in state court. He was also convicted in federal court of conspiring with members of the notorious Columbian-based Cali Cartel to distribute cocaine throughout the United States, earning a reputation as the king of Los Angeles’ cocaine rackets.

Over his decades in prison, though, Harris gained a different kind of notability; he formed the nonprofit Richmond Project, aimed at diverting youth in West Contra Costa away from crime. He became editor-in-chief of the San Quentin News and is credited with bringing the award-winning newspaper back from the brink.

“Being a drug dealer is what Michael Harris did, not who he is,” his attorneys wrote in the compassionate release motion, later adding: “During his time as a drug dealer, he has said, he had grown physically as a male, but he acted in immature boyish ways, to the detriment of himself, his family, and countless others. After more than three decades in prison, when he leaves, he will be a senior citizen, but also he will leave as a morally mature man.”

Harris has publicly apologized for the cocaine dealing of his past numerous times, and maintained his innocence in his state charges. His attorneys wrote that the purported victim of Harris’ conspiracy to commit murder conviction has since admitted his testimony was “perjured” and that Harris was innocent of his state charges. He was paroled from state prison in 2011, and immediately picked up by the U.S. Marshals and taken to Lompoc.

Harris has also gained the support of numerous public officials — including former Obama advisor Van Jones — as well as politicians like State Sen. Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley, and Contra Costa Supervisor John Gioia. Former Richmond police Chief Chris Magnus even wrote a letter advocating for Harris to be released from prison, in which Magnus described Harris as a “rare and valuable” person whose influence was “badly needed” in the Richmond community.

Last August, a federal judge denied Harris’ appeal for an early release under early release under Amendment 782, an Obama-era law that changed sentencing guidelines for federal drug convictions. It was widely — and inaccurately — reported at the time that Harris had been granted his freedom.",1

The games some people have been playing on social media — choosing who they'd want to be quarantined with — have become real life in Belgium.

Under strict lockdown since March 16, including home confinement except for essential journeys, Belgium's controls have been some of the tightest in Europe. But it's worked — after hitting one of the highest death rates in the world, the nation's infection rate and death toll have dropped steadily since a peak in early April.

The decline led Prime Minister Sophie Wilmès to announce this past week that along with letting all stores reopen on May 11, certain social distancing guidelines will be relaxed.

Beginning on Sunday for Mother's Day, Wilmès said, each household will be allowed to host up to four other people, preferably all within the same family, as long as social distancing is maintained. These groups cannot have contact with anyone else. Authorities describe it as kind of a ""contract"" between two households that will serve to limit any potential spread of COVID-19.

Of course, choosing can be a delicate process; no one wants to hurt the feelings of a friend or relative if they don't make the cut.

Seventeen-year-old music student Carla Vandersteen says her friends started texting immediately about getting together. She's made her ""list,"" consisting of the three friends who live closest to her, but still thinks it's smartest not to go out.

""At least [to protect] your parents!"" she urges. She says it would be so hard to see her best friends and not hug them. She fears many young people will now act like restrictions are completely lifted.

Many Belgians have expressed confusion about whether there's any flexibility in the new rules.

As the parents of three young children, Daniel and Marie Bach joke that as a family of five, they're mathematically ruled out of being any other household's significant others.

""I think they mean 'more or less four,'"" Marie suggests with a laugh. ""You can't just abandon your last child — it can't be so.""

While they are looking forward to some company, Daniel acknowledges ""it's a gamble"" for authorities to allow social bubbles to expand. ""A pretty big one, really.""

Then there's the dilemma of Mother's Day: visit with mom on Sunday and have her locked in as one of your ""four,"" or save that spot for someone else?

Veronique Petit says she and her husband will do some creative counting so that their two adult children can visit them and they can still visit their parents.

""It's impossible"" to follow these rules, Petit says in exasperation. ""So we're going to cheat a little. I think all Belgians are going to cheat.""

Police have admitted they won't be able to verify whether visitations are being carried out correctly, but authorities say if infections spike, restrictions will have to be tightened again.",1
839,839,1008,Sanofi walked back a promise to give the US priority access to its coronavirus vaccine after outrage from the French government,"The French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi scrapped a plan to give the US priority access to a COVID-19 vaccine it's developing after a backlash from France and the European Union.

CEO Paul Hudson previously said the US ""has the right"" to get the vaccine first should the drug prove effective because the country had contributed the most to Sanofi's vaccine project.

These remarks were criticized by French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and President Emmanuel Macron, who said no country should have priority over the drug.

On Friday, Serge Weinberg, the chairman of Sanofi's board of directors, intervened, promising no country would get priority.

Sanofi has long received funding from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. In February, BARDA sent an extra $30 million to fund Sanofi's vaccine program.

The French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi has reneged on its pledge to give the US priority access to a coronavirus vaccine it's developing after a backlash from the highest levels of French government.

CEO Paul Hudson had said on Wednesday that because the US had spent millions of dollars to support Sanofi's work on a vaccine, it ""has the right to the largest preorder."" Sanofi is developing two vaccines, neither of which has been approved for use yet.

Hudson's logic was met with outrage in France and across the European Union.

A vaccine is ""a global public good, which is not submitted to market forces,"" the office of President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday.

Prime Minister Edouard Philippe echoed those sentiments, tweeting: ""Equal access for all to vaccine is not negotiable.""

For Philippe, it was also a matter of loyalty to France. ""I just reminded Serge Weinberg who chairs Sanofi that this is a great deeply French company,"" he also said.

On Friday, Weinberg, the chairman of Sanofi's board of directors, intervened.

""I am going to be extremely clear: There will be no particular advance for any country,"" Weinberg told France 2 TV.

Macron had also been ""affected"" by Hudson's interview, a source told Bloomberg. The Sanofi CEO has been summoned to meet with Macron next Tuesday.

Sanofi has long received US government funding from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.

On February 18, Sanofi announced a new partnership with BARDA, with a new $30 million cash injection to help the search for a vaccine. At the time, Sanofi had already been working on a vaccine by leveraging its research on SARS, another respiratory disease.

Hudson told Bloomberg earlier this week that because the US was first to fund Sanofi's research, it expected ""that if we've helped you manufacture the doses at risk, we expect to get the doses first.""

As a result of the collaboration with BARDA, Hudson said the US could ""expect to get the doses first"" in return for its support.

Critics of the arrangement have pointed out that Sanofi benefits from tax credits from the French state.

The French Socialist Party estimates the French government has saved Sanofi at least 150 million euros, or $162 million, in recent years, the BBC reported.

On Thursday, 140 world leaders signed an open letter calling for a vaccine to be universally available and not patented.

""Governments and international partners must unite around a global guarantee which ensures that, when a safe and effective vaccine is developed, it is produced rapidly at scale and made available for all people, in all countries, free of charge,"" the letter said.

Stefan de Keersmaecker, a spokesman for the European Commission, told Agence France-Presse: ""The vaccine against COVID-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal.""

A Sanofi representative told Business Insider's Bryan Pietsch on Wednesday that the company was committed to making its vaccine ""accessible to everyone"" should it prove effective.

The person said partnering with BARDA allowed the company ""to initiate production as early as possible while we continue to develop and register the vaccine.""

Vaccines would be distributed in areas where they are produced, the person added.

Macron on Thursday said he expected a vaccine to be ready no earlier than winter 2021.",1
710,710,866,The doomsday bunker market is thriving amid the coronavirus pandemic,"When the end came, it was just like Tom and Mary had imagined. Supply chains started to crumble. Millions of Americans lost their jobs. Grocery stores ran out of food. The nearly retired couple wasn’t going to wait for society to collapse. They hopped in their camper van and drove 19 hours to South Dakota. “To come here and experience it in person is like walking the Grand Canyon for the first time,” Tom says. But it’s not the Grand Canyon. It’s a doomsday bunker.

Tom and Mary are living at xPoint, an abandoned military facility-turned-survivalist community at the base of the Black Hills in Fall River County. Miles of plains stretch out in all directions, connected by 100 miles of private road. Along the skyline, steel doors tucked into grassy knolls indicate the openings to the bunkers. It looks like an abandoned ranch, which is more or less what it was until a real estate mogul purchased it for the price of $1.

The idea for Vivos, a global community of apocalypse bunkers, came to CEO Robert Vicino nearly four decades ago in a moment of inspiration that featured a “crystal clear” female voice in his head. It said, Robert, you need to build deep underground bunkers for people to survive something that is coming our way. He filed it away until 2008, (the year Obama was elected) when the time was finally right to start building.

Vivos has survival campuses in South Dakota, where Tom and Mary live, and Indiana. These are for the downmarket bunkers that cost roughly $35,000 each. Vivos Europe, in contrast, is marketed as “the ultimate life assurance solution for high net worth families.” Apartments there cost upwards of $2 million.

While Vivos has been profiled as a luxury bunker facility, Vicino says most of his customers are middle-class. He describes them as “well-educated, average people with a keen awareness of the current global events and a sense of responsibility knowing they must care for and protect their families during these potential epic and catastrophic times.” Based on the people I spoke to for this story, it seems they are also all polite, white, and Trump-supporting.

As COVID-19 brings the real estate market to a standstill, demand for doomsday bunkers is at an all-time high (or low since the structures are underground). The shelters were once signifiers of fringe prepper communities worried about the coming apocalypse. During the pandemic, they’ve become vacation homes. “People thought we were crazy because they never believed anything like this could happen,” says Vicino. “Now they’re seeing it. Everybody is a believer.”

Bunkers give people a sense of control, the feeling that they can fend for themselves. Their newfound popularity mirrors an overall trend toward more disaster preparedness where behaviors that used to seem paranoid, like stockpiling food, look normal (if inadvisable) in light of the ongoing pandemic.

But the trend also has a darker side: the sense that people need to protect themselves against the other. “The have-nots are going to go after the haves,” Vicino tells me. “They will knock on your door. And if you don’t have enough to give, it gets ugly.”

Vicino doesn’t specify who the “have-nots” are, but his language echoes a specific type of pandemic-induced tribalism that’s typical in parts of white America. Since March, Stop AAPI Hate, an organization that tracks discrimination incidents, has received almost 1,500 reports of verbal harassment and physical assault from the Asian American community. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also found that COVID-19 is hitting racial minority groups harder than it is white communities. African Americans, in particular, are being hospitalized and dying at disproportionately high rates. Yet, prepper communities tend to be predominantly white.

Vivos, for its part, says it has members from “all walks of life,” and emphasize an array of religious backgrounds. Dante Vicino, Robert’s son, says “there is the expected middle-age conservative demographic, but we have political moderates and liberals, too.”

Prior to the pandemic, Vicino wasn’t making money off Vivos. “My goal is not to get rich off of this. I already was rich,” he explains. When the novel coronavirus started to spread in the United States, however, inquiries about new bunkers began to climb. At xPoint, the facility in South Dakota, Vivos has sold more than 50 bunkers and still has 500 to go. “We’re selling almost one a day right now,” Robert tells me. Two weeks ago, he says he made more than a million dollars on a single Friday. The following Monday he made $500,000.

Vivos isn’t screening incoming members for the novel coronavirus. Vicino says the tests aren’t yet “valid,” and he trusts people to make their own decisions. “If they need to wear a mask, they wear a mask,” he says. “If they need rubber gloves, they’re wearing them. At the end of the day, it’s their bunker.”

“We had a lot of snake oil companies in the indoor air space before”

Some bunker companies have capitalized on coronavirus fears and begun marketing air filtration systems that can screen out COVID-19 particles. Rising S Company, a Texas-based disaster preparedness group, calls itself the leader in “nuclear, biological and chemical air filtration systems” and says it has the “experience needed to help stop the spread of this deadly virus.” Survival Condo, a luxury bunker maker, says it has a system that “can filter out pathogens like COVID-19.” Even Vivos says its shelters come with “air scrubbers to eliminate all pathogens and radioactive particles before entering the underground space.”

“We had a lot of snake oil companies in the indoor air space before,” says Jeffrey Siegel, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Toronto who specializes in air filtration systems. “Now we have orders of magnitude more of them making specific claims about COVID.”

Siegel says that while the filters might be effective for cleaning air that comes into the bunkers, they don’t address the major concerns about how the coronavirus is actually spread. “In terms of the COVID risk, I don’t worry about outside air at all,” he says. “I worry about indoor air, and I worry about being in the space with someone who is infected.”

Siegel also says that installing fancy air filters but not testing people who’ve traveled from big cities is foolish, if not downright dangerous. “If you’re addressing the airborne route and not addressing close contact, it’s silly. We shouldn’t even be talking about it,” he says. “If the bunkers are poorly ventilated, then they’re actually more hazardous from a disease point of view than a well-ventilated house that’s not doing anything to treat outdoor air.”

For Michael, Megan, and their two kids, the pandemic was the final push needed to move out to xPoint permanently. The family of four had been living in New Carlisle, Indiana — a town of under 2,000 people — but they wanted to be even more rural. Two years earlier, they’d purchased a bunker at xPoint. Now it was time to take the leap.

“It’s foolish for anybody to think you could depend on the government”

The decision dated back to 2012 when one of their daughters got in a terrible accident at the Indiana State Fair. She was run over by a truck and suffered a crushed pelvis and two broken arms as well as numerous internal injuries that required almost 20 surgeries to recover. The experience left Michael and Megan with the knowledge that they needed to learn to fend for themselves — anything could happen at any time. “If you look at Katrina, the flooding in Texas, governments can’t control the world,” Michael says. “After all the stuff unfolds and you see the YouTube videos, it’s foolish for anybody to think you could depend on the government.”

Now that they’re in South Dakota, their days are simple and satisfying. In the morning, Megan homeschools their two girls, while Michael begins working on the bunker. He’s building a wood floor over the concrete and putting in a plumbing and electrical system. In the afternoons, Megan and the girls tend to the vegetable garden. Soon, they’ll start canning their own food. The routine is reminiscent of Little House on the Prairie or that of a minimalist Instagram influencer, except with armored doors instead of linen curtains. “The whole experience of building the bunker and being out here is fun and exciting,” Megan says. “Every day is an adventure.”

While many Vivos customers are currently building out their bunkers, Tom and Mary are one of the only other couples living at xPoint permanently. They bought their shelter three years ago after reading Patriots: A Novel of Survival in the Coming Collapse, which is popular among prepper communities. The book is a work of fiction; it tells the story of a global economic collapse where the United States becomes “gripped” in a “continual orgy of robbery, murder, looting, rape, and arson” where “hordes of refugees and looters pour out of the cities.” Tom says, “It opened my eyes to the level of vulnerability that most people have if something happens and food can’t be delivered to the store for whatever reason.”

When the couple found out about xPoint, they were intrigued but wanted to see what the community was like before committing. “It’s one thing to hide away in a hole in the ground and stay there for months, but there are some things I can’t do myself,” Tom says. “Community is going to be important because you’re going to need help.”

He decided to attend xFest, the Fourth of July festival Vivos holds to welcome prospective members. There, he found a group of like-minded individuals — mostly families and couples like himself and Mary — that he knew could form the basis of a survival network. He and Mary signed the paperwork, planning to use the bunker as a home base once they retired and began traveling across the United States.

But the pandemic shifted that timeline up considerably. In February, as cases began to grow in the US, Tom and Mary watched in horror as the signs of collapse that they’d read about in Patriots started to play out before their eyes. “We could look out the window and see people going about exhibiting behavior that was going to spread the virus like crazy,” Tom says.

Of course, they were more prepared than most, but they hadn’t anticipated situations like a toilet paper shortage. “Toilet paper is important to have, don’t get me wrong, but there were people loading up carts of toilet paper and don’t have food in their mouths,” Tom says.

“People will become predators”

The scarcity made Tom and Mary feel exposed, especially being so close to a big city. “We recognized that if we did have a full-on collapse of society as we know it, that we would be very vulnerable in our home west of Atlanta,” Tom says. They decided it was time to move.

Now, like Michael and Megan, they are living completely off the grid. XPoint has no power or electricity, and the closest town is 30 minutes away. To Tom and Mary, it’s heaven — no more blaring sirens or crowds of people. “We got here, and right away, we realized we had made it,” Tom says. “It was just this really great relief to know we were in a safe place and could manage ourselves.” He’s working on building out the bunker with everything it needs to become a livable home. Already, he’s created his own power system and has a solar array and a wind turbine. “I’m his helper,” Mary says. They don’t plan to go back to Georgia anytime soon.

While the pandemic prompted Tom and Mary to move out to their bunker and has brought in an influx of new clients, Robert Vicino is convinced it’s only the beginning. “It’s the ripple effect,” he tells me. “People will become predators.” Vicino paints a picture of looting and mayhem much like what’s described in Patriots. “The have-nots will go after the haves,” he says again. “There will be hell zones.”

If this happens, Vicino claims Vivos will be the ultimate safe zone. “I would hope that the seeds of the future society of America come through Vivos,” he says humbly. “It may sound prophetic, but it could happen.”",1
1118,1118,1358,"'Something we've never seen before': Scientists still trying to understand baffling, unpredictable coronavirus","MILWAUKEE – The new coronavirus has spread like wildfire, killed – and spared – people of all ages and all health conditions, baffled doctors, defied guidance and conventional wisdom, and produced an unprecedented array of symptoms.

There's never been a virus like it.

""This gets into every major biological process in our cells,"" said Nevan J. Krogan, a molecular biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied HIV, Ebola, Zika, dengue and other viruses over the past 13 years.

""At the molecular level, it's something we've never seen before, and then look at what it does to the body – the long list of symptoms – we've never seen that before.""

As Americans debate the reopening of businesses, bars, schools and other aspects of everyday life, it's important to understand the virus we are up against and why it has sown so much suffering and confusion.

At first, the virus was thought to be mostly a risk to older adults and people with chronic illnesses; its primary point of attack, the lungs. Then 30- and 40-years-olds with the virus began dying of strokes. Recently, a small number of infected children have died of a mysterious illness resembling Kawasaki disease.

'Like a war':Pfizer head of vaccines talks finding a treatment for coronavirus

Symptoms of COVID-19 range from fever, coughing and shortness of breath to the loss of smell and taste and the angry red swelling that has come to be known as ""COVID toes."" Studies have found that damage from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, isn't limited to the lungs; it can include the heart, liver, kidneys, gastrointestinal system and bowels.

To understand a virus' ""motivation"" – why it does what it does – keep in mind that it is a parasite. It lives inside its human or animal host taking what it needs at the expense of the host.

As long as it finds hosts without immunity, and as long as its own mutations do not weaken its ability to spread and multiply, the virus thrives.

Key benchmarks of a virus are how widely it spreads and how deadly it is to those it infects.

In the five months since it was first identified in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 4.5 million people across the globe, killing more than 300,000.

""The thing that strikes me about the clinical aspect is the shear amount of transmissibility,"" said Megan Freeman, a virologist and specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

""There are very few viruses that are more contagious than this one,"" agreed Mark Schleiss, an investigator for the Institute of Molecular Virology at the University of Minnesota.

A single COVID-19 patient spreads the disease to a median of 5.7 people, making it twice as contagious as the 1918 Spanish flu, according to a report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

A death crisis in New Jersey:How one mortician races to keep up with COVID-19

The rate of infection in the U.S. – what experts are referring to when they talk about ""flattening the curve"" – has slowed. Even so, the nation is still averaging about 1,000 COVID-19 deaths a day, roughly twice the number of deaths from 9/11 every week.

Thousands of the world's best scientists have worked with remarkable speed seeking to understand the new coronavirus. They deciphered its genetic code in barely a week and have produced scores of papers suggesting possible treatments and vaccines.

""The canvas we call COVID-19 was blank 16 weeks ago,"" said Gregory Poland, director of Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group. ""We've filled in a lot of dots, but we have so much more to go.""

""We don't understand HIV that well in my opinion,"" Krogan said, ""and we've been studying that for decades.""

Seeking the Achilles' heel of the virus

Scientists know some but not all of the reasons the new coronavirus spreads so easily. Freeman points to several factors, including one that distinguishes SARS-CoV-2 from the virus it closely resembles, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

SARS attacks the lower respiratory system, whose job it is to pull in air from the upper respiratory system.

SARS-CoV-2, however, attacks the upper respiratory system, the pathway that allows air to travel in and out of the lungs as we breathe. The upper airway is also the system involved when we cough.

The upper respiratory system offers a more efficient means of spreading, Freeman said.

""That's why it is more transmissible. ... When this emerged probably there was some mutation that adapted it to use the upper airway, and the upper airway has made it very successful.""

A second difference between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 involves the bond that allows viral cells to attach to human cells and infect them. With both viruses, this bond forms between the Spike Protein on the virus and a region on the outside of the human cell called the ACE-2 receptor.

Both viruses use this bond to enter cells, but the bond is much stronger with the new coronavirus than it was with SARS. That is why many of the potential treatments so far are designed to undermine that bond.

""You always want to target the Achilles' heel of the virus, something the virus does not have the luxury of changing too much"" explained Maria Elena Bottazzi, a professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine and co-developer of a potential SARS vaccine that is going to be tested on SARS-CoV-2.

Although public health leaders compared the new coronavirus to seasonal flu early on, coronaviruses have a special feature that separates them from other viruses like flu. They have their own proofreading system that helps limit mistakes in their genetic code known as mutations.

""Flu viruses make six and a half times more mistakes than coronaviruses do,"" Freeman said.

Even as the spread of the virus slows in the United States, some researchers fear what will happen if major outbreaks hit poorer, densely populated cities in Africa.

""Look at the problems we've had,"" Poland warned. ""Now amplify that through areas that have civil wars, that have corruption, that have scarce resources. That's a humanitarian disaster in the making.""

A remarkable destroyer

The virus' skill at spreading poses one challenge; what it does inside the human body poses another.

Much of what scientists have learned so far about the new coronavirus suggests that it is a remarkable destroyer at both the micro and macro levels, decimating individual cells and entire organs.

At the molecular level, the virus disrupts some of the most fundamental functions of life: cell division; the system cells use to talk with one another; and their ability to make proteins.

The proteins our bodies make help us carry out almost every human action from eating and walking to breathing and thinking.

Once a person ingests the new coronavirus, it enters the lungs and directly infects the air sacs, the microscopic workhorses that take in the air we breathe. In serious cases, the air sacs fill with fluid, leaving less and less room for oxygen. This is a feature of what is known as COVID-19 pneumonia.

The pneumonia can lead to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, a severe breathing condition that deprives the vital organs of oxygen.

A healthy blood oxygen level is usually between 95% and 100%. Below 90% is low. Some COVID-19 patients have been found to have blood oxygen levels below 65%.

As the air sacs are infected and damaged, this triggers the immune system, which can lead to a dangerous condition called a cytokine storm. In a cytokine storm, the immune system goes into overdrive and winds up killing both healthy and diseased cells.

One of the most subtle and deadly offshoots of low blood oxygen is a condition called silent hypoxia.

As described by emergency room doctor Richard Levitan in a commentary in The New York Times, silent hypoxia allows patients to develop low blood oxygen levels without realizing the problem until it dips into dangerous territory. They breathe faster to compensate for the lack of oxygen but are unaware they are breathing faster.

Levitan suggested that people can bypass long waits for coronavirus tests, using a simple device called a pulse oximeter as an early warning system for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. The device, which fits over your finger, measures blood oxygen levels, and can be bought at pharmacies without prescription for about $30.

Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 does not restrict its damage to the lungs.

The virus also causes blood clots, which have led to people in their 30s and 40s dying from strokes.

And then there are the recent cases in New York and Paris of children with COVID-19 who develop symptoms closely resembling Kawasaki disease. The disease begins with a rash and fever, inflames blood vessels, and eventually can damage the coronary arteries that deliver blood to the heart.

""What is it about COVID-19 that it produces Kawasaki disease?"" said Schleiss, at the University of Minnesota, who estimates he has seen more than 1,000 Kawasaki cases in his medical career.

""I don't think SARS-CoV-2 is a cause of Kawasaki disease, but it is the cause of something very similar.""

Every few weeks, SARS-CoV-2 seems to reveal new and disturbing oddities.

A recent study from China published in the journal JAMA Network Open, reported finding the new coronavirus in the semen of six of 38 infected men, raising concern that it may be possible to transmit the virus through sexual contact.

The virus also has been found in patient stool samples and untreated wastewater. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that standard methods at wastewater treatment plants should be effective enough to protect workers.

Such discoveries, however, raise fundamental questions, as we try to return to our old lives. Have we yet determined all of the ways the virus can spread from one person to another? Are there activities that may pose risks we have not anticipated?

At the University of California, San Francisco, Krogan said it will be important to examine the genetic scripts of both those who suffer severe cases of COVID-19 and those who get mild or no disease at all.

673,673,818,"Travel influencers used to sell the dream of a jetsetting lifestyle. Here's how some of the biggest industry names are making ends meet and trying to reinvent themselves in a new, remote world.","How do you make a living off of travel in a world that can't travel?

That's the question thousands of workers across the world are facing as global travel has ground to a halt because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The airline and hotel industries have been devastated. Companies like Marriott and Expedia have slashed their advertising budgets, creating a domino effect on the news media that relies heavily on ad revenue. Gannett, the largest US newspaper company, has made pay cuts and put many staffers on partial furlough. McClatchy, owner of 30 US newspapers, said in April that it would lay off four executives and furlough about 115 employees. Vox Media furloughed about 100 employees and halted all pay increases for the rest of 2020.

Travel media, already a fragile industry, is also poised to take a hard hit. Legacy travel magazines like Travel + Leisure and Condé Nast Traveler have been hit by pay cuts, as well as content and freelance budget cuts. Digital media companies that built their brands off of helping their readers travel the globe, such as The Points Guy, have seen a drop in credit card sign-ups. Travel influencers and freelance writers across the world have found themselves with no work.

Rafat Ali, the CEO of Skift, a travel news and industry intelligence company, told Business Insider that the pain is likely only beginning for the media industry.

""I think some of the layoffs in the media industry are too small,"" Ali said. ""I think it's unfortunately going to be a lot worse than people are imagining in terms of the hurt the media will have to go through.""

'Different stages of hurt'

Per Ali, many major media organizations have made the mistake of covering travel as a leisure, not as a business.

""I think that the biggest disservice that the travel industry has done to itself is to market itself as a leisure. And what that means is it's also disposable, which means that it's the first thing that gets cut in media in general,"" Ali said, pointing to the New York Times' recent decision to temporarily stop publishing its travel section in its Sunday print edition.

The pandemic has ushered in an ""age of news,"" and many travel magazines focus on longer feature pieces rather than hard news, according to Ali.

""They're not built for the metabolism that this time needs,"" he said.

Conde Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure, the two legacy brands that dominate the travel magazine scene, have both encountered major challenges since the pandemic first brought life in the US to a halt eight weeks ago. And smaller travel magazines such as Afar, which lack the resources of larger publications, could face even more distress.

""I wouldn't be surprised — not that there are even many travel magazines left — but I wouldn't be surprised if there are even less left in the next year,"" Ali told Business Insider.

Many of the biggest companies that advertise with travel magazines are suffering themselves. In mid-March, Airbnb suspended all of its marketing activities. A week later, on March 19, Marriott CEO Arne Morris Sorenson said that the world's largest hotel company's advertising budget had ""gone dark."" Expedia normally spends $5 billion on advertising but plans to spend less than $1 billion in 2020.

Some travel magazines had relatively robust sales at newsstands and airports before the pandemic, Ali said. But now, with virtually nobody traveling or going to newsstands, ""they're all, I'm sure, in different stages of hurt,"" he said.

Readers want travel content that answers their practical travel questions right now

Condé Nast Traveler's parent company, Condé Nast, announced pay cuts for its highest-earning staff and said it could announce layoffs by the end of May. Condé Nast Traveler has not laid off any staffers, but it has reduced its freelance budget and made cuts to its content budget, a spokesperson for the magazine told Business Insider. Many of the magazine's advertising partners have postponed campaigns until later in the year after the travel sector opens back up.

The magazine did not provide Business Insider with specific numbers for how advertising revenue had been affected, but Jesse Ashlock, Condé Nast Traveler's US Editor, described a bleak outlook.

""I'm not going to lie and say that we're healthy right now,"" Ashlock told Business Insider. ""It's a tough time. We've had a precipitous decline in the second quarter and we anticipate that continuing into the third quarter.""

Jesse Ashlock, US Editor for Condé Nast Traveler. Condé Nast Traveler

Condé Nast Traveler has pivoted from conventional destination-oriented coverage toward both coronavirus coverage and ""pure inspo,"" as Ashlock describes it.

""People want to know about how coronavirus is impacting airline policies, booking policies, when am I gonna be able to travel again, all those kinds of fundamental questions that anybody who loves travel is going to have right now,"" he said. ""And people also want permission to dream, to just have a kind of escape hatch in a way that travel can also provide.""

Readers want practical information on how the coronavirus is affecting travel right now, Ashlock says. Condé Nast Traveler

Travel + Leisure's parent company, Meredith, has frozen hiring and implemented sweeping pay cuts for 60% of its employees, but has not announced any layoffs.

The magazine saw a 14% increase in unique visitors to its website in March as compared to the same time period in 2019, according to figures from media analytics company Comscore. While April's Comscore numbers were not yet available at the time of publication, the spokesperson said that, per internal reporting, the magazine did not see the same boost in readership in April.

""In general, the media landscape is really challenging right now,"" Jacqueline Gifford, Travel + Leisure's editor-in-chief, told Business Insider.

Like Condé Nast Traveler, Travel + Leisure has had to adjust its coverage to the times. Gifford said the magazine, which prints 12 issues per year, held off on publishing a planned piece on Italy's Emilia Romagna region — one of the hardest-hit by the virus — that had been in the works for a year. The magazine's new mix of coverage includes practical tips such as how to get airline refunds, pieces on virtual travel, and stories like an essay about learning to love wherever you are.

While travel magazines may be adapting in the short term, the worst may be yet to come, according to Skift's Ali.

""Advertising will be hurt even when the recovery starts,"" Ali told Business Insider. ""... There's businesses that will close, tour operators and travel agents, that advertise a lot in these fancy magazines. Destinations will be hurt.""

Businesses will still need to advertise, but whether they will splurge for space in travel magazines remains to be seen, he said.

Lucrative digital media companies are waiting out the pandemic

Meanwhile, digital media companies whose business models seem based on affiliate revenue seem better positioned to weather the downturn.

The Points Guy, a profitable travel and credit-card-rewards website also known as TPG, rakes in affiliate fees by getting readers to sign up for credit cards or reward programs. Every time someone signs up for a credit card or rewards program via the site, the company collects anywhere from $25 to $700, a former editorial employee previously told Business Insider.

But in a global pandemic that has halted travel and left millions jobless, not many people are signing up for credit cards or travel rewards programs.

TPG has seen ""a massive drop"" in credit card sign-ups, a current employee told Business Insider. Some of the company's bank partners, including Bank of America and Capital One, have pulled all affiliate links from TPG, according to internal emails reviewed by Business Insider.

A spokesperson for Capital One declined to comment on the record about its affiliate marketing activities, but CEO Richard Fairbank said in an earnings call on April 23 that the company is ""pulling back on marketing in the near term"" due to the coronavirus. A spokesperson for Bank of America also declined to comment.

TPG has not announced any layoffs or pay cuts, but some employees may be temporarily reassigned to other brands owned by TPG's parent company, Red Ventures, the employee said.

But TPG may have the resources to weather the crisis. The company has been profitable every year it has existed, CEO Brian Kelly told Digiday in 2019. In the year before the pandemic, it made upwards of $50 million in profit, according to the current employee.

""They were very cash rich to begin with going into this, so at minimum they have tons of cash reserve, not just them, but their parent company [Red Ventures] as well,"" says Ali. ""... Their business, which is credit cards, I'm sure is hurt a lot, but again, they have the money.""

Business Insider reached out to TPG and Red Ventures for comment on this article. TPG did not respond to the request directly but declined through Red Ventures. Red Ventures also declined to comment.

While TPG is one of the most prominent travel media start-ups, it's not the only one that relies heavily on affiliate revenue. Nomadic Matt, a travel website founded by Matt Kepnes, usually makes money through affiliate bookings, advertising revenue, events, and book sales. But in the second week of March, there was an immediate drop.

""There are no affiliate revenues, no one's booking travel,"" Kepnes told Business Insider. ""I think I made like a hundred bucks last month.""

A post shared by Matt Kepnes | Nomadic Matt (@nomadicmatt) Apr 22, 2020 at 12:59pm PDT

Thanks to assistance from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a $349 billion relief fund of government-backed loans for small businesses, Kepnes hasn't had to lay off his four employees. He thinks the business will be able to stay afloat until the fall.

""I think by then people will start booking again,"" he said. ""Will it be as good as it was pre-COVID? No. But we have pretty low expenses other than salaries, so I'm not too worried. We had a lot in the bank.""

From getting paid for their travels across the globe to having nowhere to go

Travel influencers and freelance writers, who not too long ago were the envy of everyone who dreams of quitting their corporate job and getting paid to travel, now find themselves with no work — and often, with no safety net.

Even as people stuck in their homes are spending more time on social media, brands are slashing influencer marketing budgets, deferring payments, and postponing campaigns, devastating income for travel influencers, as Amanda Perelli and Dan Whateley recently reported for Business Insider.

A post shared by Oneika Raymond🇨🇦🇯🇲 (@oneikatraveller) Apr 28, 2020 at 9:43am PDT

Travel blogger Oneika Raymond, who has more than 84,500 Instagram followers, told Perelli and Whateley that ""companies are reluctant to take on anything new and therefore that is impacting the income of creators."" Another travel influencer, Lauren Bullen, who lives in Bali and has 2.1 million Instagram followers, said all her paid trips had been canceled.

Jimmy Im is a freelance travel writer who left a full-time staff job at CNBC Make It in September 2019 and has written for publications including Business Insider, Condé Nast Traveler, and Travel + Leisure. In a typical pre-pandemic month, he was traveling for two to three weeks and producing between two and six commissioned stories.

Then, in March, when he was in the Catskills in upstate New York working on three stories, the coronavirus was declared a pandemic. Two of his Catskills stories were canceled, and things went downhill from there.

""Work is nonexistent,"" Im told Business Insider at the end of April. ""Nobody is taking travel stories right now … Since the pandemic and the lockdowns, I've had zero, zero work.""

Im has had to cancel upcoming trips to Argentina and Florida and is living off of his savings and unemployment benefits. He's stayed busy working on his novel and his personal travel blog, but he's worried about how he's going to keep paying rent on his Manhattan apartment past July.

Travel blogger Kiersten Rich of The Blonde Abroad, who has upwards of 561,000 Instagram followers, told Business Insider that traffic to her blog has dwindled by 50% since January, leading to a drop in ad revenue and decreased affiliate link payouts. At least four of her contracted travel campaigns are on hold, she says.

In the meantime, Rich has pivoted to posting about home goods, self-improvement, and self-care on her blog and Instagram account. She expects the travel blogging industry to become even more competitive going forward.

""There will still be budgets for marketing, and destinations will be looking to attract visitors as soon as it's safe to travel again, but I think those brands will be more selective about who they work with, and on what platform,"" she said.

Silver linings

Despite travel media's current state of turmoil, some remain hopeful about the future of the industry. As Ali of Skift put it, not being able to travel has made the world realize just how important travel is.

Ashlock of Condé Nast Traveler says the pandemic may force travel publications to finally diversify their revenue streams.

""This is quite indicative of how challenging it can be to rely so heavily on advertising, and so that's something we're going to have to look closely at as we go forward,"" he said.

Kepnes of Nomadic Matt, meanwhile, is squaring up against the state of complete uncertainty ahead.

""Now, what happens after the summer? I don't really know,"" Kepnes said. ""I like to be optimistic, because if you're a pessimist, then how do you get through the day?""",1
138,138,192,Ford Joins Effort to Make Ventilators,"
This briefing is no longer updating. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.
Ford Motor and General Electric will produce 50,000 ventilators.Ford Motor and General Electric’s health care division said on Monday that they together planned to produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days to help meet the needs of hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic.
Ford plans to continue making about 30,000 ventilators a month once the initial batch has been made. Ford will use a plant in Rawsonville, Mich., and about 500 workers to make the medical devices.
Ford’s effort is the second-such initiative by a major automaker. General Motors has said it plans to make ventilators at one of its factories in Kokomo, Ind., with Ventec Life Systems, a ventilator manufacturer. Tesla, the electric car company, has also said that it intends to make ventilators with Medtronic at a factory in Buffalo.
G.E. has licensed the design of the ventilator from Airon Corporation of Melbourne, Fla. The device works on air pressure and does not need electricity, and the companies said it could be useful for most coronavirus patients who need help breathing.
Ford and G.E. said last week that Ford would help increase production of another ventilator based on a design from G.E. Healthcare.
Stocks climb but investor unease continues.Stocks on Wall Street rose on Monday as investors bid up shares of health care companies as they reported progress on products that could help with the coronavirus outbreak.
The S&P 500 climbed more than 3 percent, adding to a strong showing last week. The S&P 500 had risen 10 percent last week after a three-day run that was its best since 1933, amid relief over Washington’s $2 trillion spending plan.
Gainers on Monday included Johnson & Johnson, which said it had identified a lead candidate for a vaccine for the virus and planned to ramp up both production and clinical testing. Abbott Laboratories rose on reports that it had said a new test that could detect the virus in five minutes had been cleared for use by the Food and Drug Administration.
But there were lingering signs of caution in the financial markets. Most notably, oil prices tumbled to their lowest levels since 2002.
And in the stock market, Monday’s rally came on relatively light volume, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, a trading and asset management firm. That suggests a lack of conviction among investors, he said.
“It’s a little bit of lack of confidence,” said Mr. Maley, “And you can’t blame them after what’s happened.”
Some industries continued to be battered by the long shadow of the virus. Cruise lines Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and Carnival were all down 10 percent, making them some of the worst performers in the S&P 500 on Monday. United Airlines, American Airlines and Boeing, all of which had rallied last week on expectations that they would benefit from government assistance, also fell sharply.
The dizzying moves that characterized trading in financial markets for most of March seem to have ended as policymakers around the world moved to bolster their economies with spending and other means of support. But investors were weighing those efforts against the rising number of coronavirus cases and the redoubled efforts to contain the pandemic.
President Trump on Sunday extended guidelines on social distancing and nonessential travel in the United States, an admission that there is no certainty around when the spreading coronavirus epidemic will end.
In the oil market, brent crude, the international benchmark, fell more than 6 percent to roughly $26 a barrel on Monday. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, was down more than 5 percent with prices hovering around $20.25 in early afternoon trading. Earlier in the morning the price had briefly dropped below $20 a barrel, a level not seen in almost 20 years.
Oil has also been hammered by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the largest oil producers, but analysts say that it is far outweighed by the collapse in demand caused by the pandemic.
FGE, a consulting firm, recently estimated that demand for April would fall by 17 million barrels a day — to about 17 percent lower than usual — as airplanes are grounded, road traffic falls sharply and factories are shuttered.
Misleading coronavirus videos posted by Brazil’s president are pulled down.Facebook and Twitter took down posts featuring Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, over the past two days after he claimed that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine was a “cure everywhere” for the coronavirus and called for an end to social distancing and shelter-in-place measures in Brazil.
Mr. Bolsonaro had posted the videos, which showed him talking to street vendors in the Taguatinga district of Brasília, Brazil’s capital, to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on Sunday. The New York Times has reported that there is no proof that the drug is effective against the virus.
Twitter took down the videos on Sunday. The videos on Facebook and Instagram were taken down on Monday evening. The companies said the posts violated their policies for spreading misinformation that could also lead to physical harm.
But the moves were unusual for the tech companies, which have long been hesitant to remove posts from world leaders, even when they walk the line of disinformation. The companies have said posts from world leaders are newsworthy.
Twitter deleted a post by President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela last week, in which Mr. Maduro promoted a “brew” that he claimed could cure coronavirus. President Trump has previously posted that hydroxychloroquine showed “tremendous promise,” which the social media companies said did not violate their policies because there was not a clear call to action that would cause the public any harm.
Macy’s has lost the ‘majority’ of its sales.
Macy’s, which also owns Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury, said on Monday that it had lost “the majority” of its sales because of store closures, which started March 18 and would persist until the retailer had a “clear line of sight on when it is safe to reopen.”
The company said it will furlough the majority of its employees this week and would maintain the “absolute minimum work force needed to maintain basic operations,” according to a statement. There will be fewer furloughs of employees supporting the digital business at call centers and distribution centers. Macy’s had 125,000 part-time and full-time employees at the end of last year.
The move shows the strain that the pandemic is placing on retailers selling goods that are considered nonessential. Many department stores and mall chains had already been weakened in recent years by the rise of e-commerce and a drop in foot traffic at malls. A complete closure of stores is dealing a new blow.
Macy’s said that it had already stopped capital spending and paying a dividend. It has also drawn down its line of credit and canceled some orders.
Retail workers have been affected across the board. L Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, said it would furlough most store staff and “those who are not currently working to support the online businesses or who cannot work from home” starting April 5.
Gap, which also owns Old Navy and Banana Republic, said on Monday it would furlough nearly 80,000 store employees in the United States and Canada.
On Wednesday, April 1, many monthly bills will come due, and households and businesses across the nation will struggle to make their payments.
Residents won’t make rent, and small businesses will have to forgo lease payments. Even the multibillion-dollar Cheesecake Factory has told landlords not to expect an April check.
The trajectory of the U.S. economy largely depends on how many bills go unpaid. The money from the $2 trillion relief package that President Trump recently signed into law will be distributed too late to help many.
Homeowners will have to choose between rent or electricity. Businesses could start laying off workers.
“These are cascades that, once they get going, are very hard to stop,” said Claudia Sahm, head of macroeconomic policy for the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “You’re already seeing it.”
New York’s attorney general has questions for Zoom about privacy and security.Zoom, the popular videoconferencing app whose traffic has surged amid the coronavirus pandemic, is under scrutiny by the office of New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, for its data privacy and security practices.
The attorney general’s office sent a letter to Zoom on Monday asking what, if any, new security measures the company had put in place to handle increased traffic on its network and to detect hackers, according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times.
The letter referred to Zoom as “an essential and valuable communications platform,” but it outlined several concerns, noting that the company had been slow to address security flaws such as vulnerabilities that have allowed malicious users to invade videoconferences held on the service, a practice known as Zoombombing.
Instacart shoppers are staging a walkout over safety concerns.
In a sign of workers’ growing anxiety as the coronavirus pandemic rages, thousands of drivers and shoppers for the grocery delivery service Instacart walked off the job on Monday, demanding greater pay and better access to paid leave and cleaning material.
Though the size of the walkout was unclear, organizers said they believed that thousands of the company’s 200,000 shoppers, who work as independent contractors, were refusing to work. Their hope is to pressure the company by adding to the backlogs the service was already experiencing, as locked-down Americans have opted to get their daily staples delivered rather than venture out to stores.
The strike appeared to be having some effect on Monday. Ryan Hartson, an Instacart worker in Chicago, shared a screenshot from his Instacart app showing that many time slots were available for shoppers to pick up groceries, suggesting that the supply of workers was smaller than usual.
“Our team has had an unwavering commitment to prioritize the health and safety of the entire Instacart community,” Nilam Ganenthiran, president of Instacart, said in a statement. “We’ve been evaluating the Covid-19 crisis minute-by-minute to provide real-time support for Instacart shoppers and customers.”
As for Monday’s action, “we’ve seen absolutely no impact to Instacart’s operations,” a company spokeswoman said.
Catch up: Here’s what else is happening.American Airlines plans to apply for some of the $50 billion airline bailout included in the federal stimulus that was signed into law last week, its chief executive and president said in a memo to staff. The airline expects to receive $12 billion, some of which will be used to pay employees through September. The carrier also said it was offering leave, with partial pay, and early retirement to interested employees.See’s Candies, the California chocolatier, said in a statement on its website that it was halting production, just the second interruption in its 99-year history. (The first time was during World War II.) “In recognition of the guidance provided by local health authorities, See’s has suspended production and shipping of product,” the company said.Facebook announced Monday that it would give out $25 million in grants to local news organizations and spend $75 million in marketing that will go to news outlets internationally. Campbell Brown, a Facebook vice president, acknowledged in an interview that the company, whose huge chunk of online ad revenue helped dent media companies’ business models in the first place, felt a “responsibility” to help out.Reporting was contributed by Davey Alba, Sheera Frenkel, Kate Conger, Ernesto Londono, Danny Hakim, Natasha Singer, Matt Phillips, Stanley Reed, Kenneth P.

481,481,587,Microsoft confirms Windows 10X is coming to laptops amid big jump in Windows usage,"Microsoft is confirming today that it’s planning to refocus Windows 10X on single-screen devices. “The world is a very different place than it was last October when we shared our vision for a new category of dual-screen Windows devices,” explains Panos Panay, Microsoft’s Windows and devices chief. “With Windows 10X, we designed for flexibility, and that flexibility has enabled us to pivot our focus toward single-screen Windows 10X devices that leverage the power of the cloud to help our customers work, learn and play in new ways.”

Microsoft isn’t saying exactly when single-screen devices like laptops will support Windows 10X, nor when dual-screen devices will launch with the OS. However, Windows 10X will launch on single-screen devices first. “We will continue to look for the right moment, in conjunction with our OEM partners, to bring dual-screen devices to market,” says Panay.

Microsoft is reprioritizing Windows 10X for laptops and single-screen devices because of the coronavirus pandemic. The software maker has seen a 75 percent year-over-year increase in the time spent in Windows 10. More people are turning to using their laptops or PCs instead of a smartphone or tablet during the lockdowns we’ve seen worldwide to work or study.

Originally planned for dual-screen hardware like the Surface Neo, Windows 10X includes a more stripped-back, simplified, and modern Windows interface. Microsoft has been working to modernize Windows 10X with some UI and UX changes that improve basics like multitasking, using the Start menu, and quick access to settings.

Microsoft has, to date, only discussed Windows 10X running on dual-screen and foldable computers, but leaks soon after its announcement suggested the streamlined OS would also appear on laptops. Microsoft is not discussing a timeline for its release, though, or whether the dual-screen Surface Neo is delayed beyond 2020 as reports have suggested.

It’s not clear exactly what Windows 10X will bring to regular laptops outside of its UX improvements, modernization, and container app technology. Windows 10X already needed some explaining for dual-screen devices, so Microsoft is going to have to be careful about avoiding having two different versions of Windows for single-screen devices.

We’re now expecting to hear more about the cloud-powered virtualization parts of Windows 10X at the Build developers conference later this month. There will be a bigger focus on Windows, given its importance during the pandemic, and Panay promises “we are going to share how we will reduce complexity for developers by making it easier than ever to build for all 1 billion Windows 10 devices, all at once.”",1

The city is now testing people who are asymptomatic, and authorities say the tests are voluntary. The testing identified 28 new asymptomatic carriers and no cases with symptoms, authorities said.

India also reported 120 additional deaths relating to the coronavirus, bringing total fatalities to 2,872, the health ministry data showed. Despite the continued jump in cases and deaths, India is expected to ease some lockdown measures starting Monday. The country's nationwide lockdown started in late March and has since been extended twice. — Yen Nee Lee

11:45 am: Thailand reopens shopping malls, restaurants as new cases fall

Thailand eased restrictions further this weekend by allowing more businesses and activities to resume, including department stores, restaurants and some sporting facilities. The government also shortened the nationwide curfew by one hour. The nighttime curfew will now run from 11 p.m. — instead of 10 p.m. previously — until 4 a.m. the next day. But other businesses and activities such as cinemas and amusement parks remain closed, while the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand extended its ban on all international passengers into the country until the end of June. The number of new daily cases in Thailand has slowed to a trickle this month. As of Saturday, the Southeast Asian country has reported 3,025 confirmed infections and 56 deaths, according to the Department of Disease Control. — Yen Nee Lee

10:55 am: South Korea confirms 13 more cases

South Korea reported 13 new confirmed coronavirus cases, bringing its tally to 11,050, according to the latest data by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those, five cases were detected in Seoul, where a new cluster of infections linked to several nightclubs and bars was recently found. Authorities have been tracking down the roughly 5,500 people that visited the affected nightlife spots between April 24 and May 6 — more than a thousand of them still out of contact, according to Yonhap News Agency. The number of coronavirus-related deaths in South Korea remained at 262 after KCDC reported no additional fatalities in the past day. — Yen Nee Lee

10:10 am: Mexico's death toll cross 5,000

Mexico's health ministry said there were another 278 coronavirus-related fatalities, taking the country's death toll to 5,045 since the outbreak, reported Reuters. Mexico's Covid-19 death rate is higher compared to the global average because pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, hybertension and obesity are more widespread among the population, according to the report. The country's cumulative confirmed cases jumped by 2,112 to 47,144, said the report. — Yen Nee Lee

9:25 am: China reports 5 new cases, no additional deaths

China's National Health Commission said there were five new coronavirus cases in the past day. Two of those cases were ""imported,"" while the remaining three were detected in the northeastern province of Jilin, said NHC. That brings the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 82,947, according to the commission. The country's death toll remained at 4,634, said NHC. Jilin province has experienced a resurgence in cases. Last week, Shulan — a city in the province — reported new cases for the first time in more than 70 days. That prompted authorities to reinstate some restrictions, such as closing sporting facilities and libraries, and halting some train services. — Yen Nee Lee

896,896,1070,A Joffrey workout: 3 dancers suggest exercises to tone muscles at home,"Even with the prospect of Illinois businesses reopening in phases in the coming months, and the warmer weather beckoning us to step outside for a walk or jog to keep fit and get some much-needed sunshine, there are still plenty of indoor workout options to consider in this stay-at-home age.

We turned to Chicago’s Joffrey Ballet company members Brooke Linford, Princess Reid and Graham Maverick to share some easy-to-do-at-home exercises to help tone and stretch. They’re easy enough to do while binge-watching your favorite Netflix series, and best of all, they’re ideal for everyone from workout novices to diehards.

“I now try to work out five days a week,” said Linford, a six-year member of the Joffrey. “Especially stretching. It’s so important.”

While the dancers technically work out six days a week during a regular Joffrey season with rehearsals, dance classes and general exercise, the pandemic has meant the cancellation of the company’s entire season — and that community experience. And while the company provides online classes via Zoom three times a week for its dancers, working out during a quarantine has become an individual effort.

“The [online] classes make us feel like we’re all together in a way, but working out on our own is a big part of [staying in shape],” Linford said. “I would encourage everyone to try some kind of stretching exercise a few days a week if possible, even for 15 minutes. Most important is to set goals for yourself and not get discouraged or frustrated. You don’t need a full, intense workout every day. Just do what you can to make your body feel healthy and happy.”

Graham Maverick

Number of years dancing with the company: 13

Favorite workout and why: I love working out in many different ways. Between yoga, ballet, biking or just going to the gym it’s hard to say what is my favorite. One of the exercises that I have been doing more now at the house has been calf raises. You stand with the ball of one foot on the bottom step and do about 20 to 30 releves (rises) on each side at a time. It helps strengthen both your calves and ankles, and you should get a nice burn quickly.

Some things to think about when doing your calf raises: Make sure that your body is completely parallel with your foot and when you do the raises make sure that you not only go all the way up but also down. One of the best things about this workout is that you don’t need much to do it, only a staircase or even a large [hardcover] book such as one of the later “Harry Potter” books.

Music inspiration: I enjoy a lot of music, new and old, but what I’ve been playing for my workout recently has been Black Sabbath’s first album. Really gets the blood going for me.

Brooke Linford

Number of years as Joffrey artist: 6

Favorite workout and why: My favorite exercise is clamshells because I feel like it is the “magic physical therapy exercise” to make my body happy and healthy. It targets the gluteus medius, and in doing so also provides stability in the ankles, knees and back. I feel like at any given time in ballet class or rehearsal there is always one person doing clamshells.

What should people make sure they do in order to do this exercise correctly: There are different angles at which you can have your knees and still have it work. But the most important thing is to not rotate your hips [forward] and keep your body in line. Sometimes I like to put my hand on my hip to make sure I’m not opening up to get a little more rotation with my knee.

Best household item to accompany your workout: For extra strengthening it’s helpful to add a resistance band or theraband tied above your knees. But if you don’t have that available, using your hand on your thigh and gently pushing when opening and closing adds good resistance as well.

Favorite workout song: It depends on my mood, but right now I’m feeling the disco essentials playlist on Apple Music. I definitely need something with a strong or funky beat to help motivate myself.

Princess Reid

Number of years as Joffrey artist: 2

Favorite workout and why: My favorite workout is actually a stretch called the “pigeon pose.” I like this stretch because it really gets into your hamstring and the front of your hip (hip flexor). It’s nice to do before a class or workout.

Favorite workout song: One of my favorite songs to workout to is “Fantazia” by Roy Blair. I like this one because the beat is great for cardio.

Unlike the superstar basketball player, ESPN’s ‘The Last Dance’ is anything but great. It claims to reveal the man behind the legend – but is actually just a fawning, cultish piece of propaganda.

Michael Jordan is arguably the greatest basketball player of all time, and the much-hyped ESPN 10-part documentary on his career and final championship season with the Chicago Bulls, 'The Last Dance,' which comes to a close this Sunday night, claims to reveal the man behind the legend.

I’ll save you the suspense – spoiler alert – and let you know how the movie ends… the Bulls win a sixth championship and Jordan is never challenged… not on the basketball court. Nor, sadly, in this documentary.

Read more

'The Last Dance' isn’t so much a documentary as a piece of '90s nostalgia porn that serves as an exercise in sports media genuflection in the form of an epic, 10-hour infomercial for the Jordan brand.

The film’s alleged claim to fame is that it reveals never-before-seen footage of Jordan during the Bulls’ 1998 championship run. The problem is that Jordan himself controls the rights to this painfully banal and contrived footage, and in order to use it, producers Michael Tollin and Jon Weinbach, as well as ESPN and Netflix, had to make Jordan’s production company, Jump 23, a co-producer on the project. It all means that His Airness got the last word on what does, and does not, make the final cut of 'The Last Dance.' The result of which is more shameless hagiography than documentary.

As a business decision, ESPN and Netflix undoubtedly made the right one, as the film is being devoured by sports-starved fans in the age of coronavirus, and is a runaway success with sky-high ratings.

As a journalistic decision, though, 'The Last Dance' traded away any semblance of journalistic integrity for the golden goose of access. Whether it is embedded journalists with troops in a warzone, or the press making deals in the halls of power, access to power is always acquiescence to power.

Evidence of which is that the 'The Last Dance' doesn’t try to “Be Like Mike” with his trademark tenacity, instead it goes remarkably soft on its subject, and delicately dances around his pronounced shortcomings.

'The Last Dance' feels like one of those interviews with a politician where they are asked: “What are your greatest weaknesses?” And the politician answers, to much eye-rolling, that they “work too hard and care too much.”

Also on rt.com Michael Jordan reveals he wanted to sign with ADIDAS, not Nike, but said the sportswear giants WEREN'T INTERESTED enough

The docu-series reduces Jordan’s compulsive gambling and toxic personal behavior and bullying of teammates into simply being the result of his maniacal competitiveness. You see, according to 'The Last Dance,' even Jordan’s personal failures are because he is so great.

The film lays it on particularly thick when teammate B.J. Armstrong claims the notoriously bullying Jordan wasn’t exactly a good guy. Jordan self-pityingly responds, in essence, that his being considered “not a nice guy” is the heavy price he had to pay for his greatness. Jordan then breaks down crying and dramatically declares the interview over. Of course, the hapless director, Jason Hehir, doesn’t dare resist his boss.

There is another telling sequence in the film dealing with Scottie Pippen’s “quitting” on his team in the final 1.8 seconds of a playoff game in 1994, when coach Phil Jackson calls on Toni Kukoc for the final shot instead of Pippen. Jordan comments in the doc that the “quitting” incident ""is always going to come back to haunt [Pippen]…”

What is so striking about that sequence is that Jordan wasn’t playing on that Bulls team, he had “retired” at the end of the ‘93 season, supposedly because he was exhausted dealing with the difficulties of superstardom and the omnipresent media.

What did Jordan do in 1994 to escape dealing with fans and the press? Did he go into seclusion? Go fishing? No. He went, with great fanfare, and played minor league baseball, and then 18 months later returned to basketball after the Bulls failed to win a title without him.

According to Jordan and the decidedly deferential 'The Last Dance,' Pippen quitting on his team for 1.8 seconds means he is forever tarred by it, while Jordan, who quit on his team for a full 18 months, is beyond reproach.

The docu-series doesn’t have the journalistic courage to challenge the myth of Jordan at all. If it attempted to be even mildly adversarial, it might highlight that, unlike Jordan, fellow NBA greats like Magic Johnson (five titles) and Bill Russell (11 titles) weren’t jerks to their teammates, but inspirations.

Or that, unlike say Johnson or Larry Bird, who won titles early in their careers, Jordan had to wait until all the great teams of his time, such as the Celtics, Lakers and Pistons, had aged out of their prime before he could go on his championship run in an NBA greatly watered-down due to expansion in the 90s.

It also fails to notice that Jordan’s greatest moments during his reign came against lowly positional rivals like John Starks, Craig Ehlo and Bryon Russell… not exactly Hall of Famers.

Or that since his retirement, his main claim to fame has been a TV advert for Gatorade entitled Be Like Mike, set to the song from 'The Jungle Book.'

The bottom line is this: Jordan is undeniably one of the most aesthetically and athletically dynamic icons in sports history, but 'The Last Dance' isn’t an investigation or even contemplation of the man and his legacy, but rather a cultish coronation that unquestioningly embraces previously manufactured mythmaking. That’s not sports journalism, it’s self-serving sycophancy, and NBA fans deserve much better.

1390,1397,1939,Israel’s intent to annex part of West Bank may spark new wide-scale Middle East crisis amidst global pandemic,"Submitted by InfoBrics, authored by Paul Antonopoulos, independent geopolitical analyst…

Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas announced that the Palestinian state and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) will no longer adhere to the agreements they signed with Israel and the United States. It is a reaction to Israel’s intentions to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank. If Abbas’s intentions are consistently implemented, it would be a paradox for Palestine to abolish itself.

“The Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Palestinian state are rejecting any commitments from all agreements with the US administration and Israel, including those related to security,” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in response to the Israeli government’s intention to start on July 1 the process of annexing territories controlled by illegal Jewish settlers in the West Bank.

Abbas did not mention any specific agreements, but it is believed he is referring to a series of agreements signed by the Palestinians with Israel in the 1990’s – the 1993 Oslo Accords, the 1997 Hebron Protocol, and the 1998 Wye River Memorandum.

However, by cancelling the Oslo Accords, could the Palestinian Authority be abolishing itself?

If Abbas is referring to the entire Oslo Agreement, it would in a way mean the dissolution of the Palestinian Authority, since they emerged from that agreement. Abbas’s reaction was caused not only by the intention of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to annex large areas of the West Bank on July 1, but also by the visit of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Israel, who undoubtedly supports the move.

Security coordination with Israel, which Palestine could be giving up, is one of the most important aspects of the Oslo Agreement, which has become a cornerstone of the so-called peace process. Security coordination is essential for the day-to-day functioning of both the Palestinian Authority and Israel. The Palestinian Authority is highly dependent, in daily terms, on this cooperation with the Israeli authorities. And not only on security, but also on economics, as well as on the inflow of financial resources, which come from the Israeli government to Palestinian institutions.

Even in earlier announcements, despite the interruptions, the essential parts of the implementation of coordination were never questioned. Abbas is now more serious than before when he announced and threatened to sever security ties which could be a blow to Israel, even if it means the Palestinian authorities lose the legal basis of its existence in international eyes.

Secretary of the Palestinian Fatah organization, Fayez Abu Aita, said that in these circumstances breaking all agreements, including the Oslo peace agreement, was absolutely necessary – this is the only way to protect their territories.

“It is not our fault that we are now on the edge of a new stage, a new great confrontation with Israel. Only by breaking all obligations with Washington and Tel Aviv, Palestine has the chance to defend its right to exist, the right to own land. After all, we said that we would not allow the implementation of the Deal of the Century. The Israeli government only heard itself and its greed. But this was only the first step: the further the Israeli side goes, the more serious the Palestinian response will be,” he said. “There is nothing else left for us, considering how quickly Israel extends its hands to our land. They were the first to bring the situation to a dangerous dead end.”

If Israel annexes the West Bank, hopes of creating an Arab state within the 1967 borders will be extinguished.

While the U.S. supports Israel’s annexation, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday in a telephone conversation with Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazim confirmed the readiness of Russia to further promote the resumption of the peace process between Palestinians and Israelis. Russia is trying to prevent the annexation and, through diplomatic means, gather an international quartet with the participation of the UN.

Effectively Russia could be using this as an opportunity to present itself as a peace broker in the Palestine-Israel conflict. Whether this will be successful or not remains to be seen, but is necessary when it appears there is a strong chance that the Palestine-Israel conflict can breakout extremely violent again in the coming weeks amidst the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.

254,254,329,Chicago health care workers cheer patients released after beating COVID-19,"Advocate Aurora Health discharged its 1,000th COVID-19 patient this week, a landmark that health care workers at the hospital system are celebrating by spotlighting the many individual victories behind that figure.

At Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center in Lake View, Carmen Benabe, 86, was released to quarantine at home four days after being admitted to the emergency room with a COVID-19 diagnosis, according to a release from the hospital system. Benabe’s daughter, Dalia Colon, said the family is thankful in a statement, and that her mom is looking forward to enjoying home-cooked Puerto Rican meals again soon.

At Advocate Trinity Hospital on the South Side, Paul Richards, 69, a retired Chicago firefighter and a Vietnam veteran, headed home amid a standing ovation, passing handmade posters that read “#GOINGHOME” after he spent two weeks on a ventilator for COVID-19 symptoms.

“It was like being in Vietnam,” Richards said in a release from the hospital. “Everyone responded with no hesitation. Everyone stepped up to do what they had to do and put their lives on the line to care for me.”

Dr. Gary Stuck, chief medical officer of Advocate Aurora Health, said he was “grateful for [the] service and sacrifice” of doctors and nurses at the hospital system, emphasized that there’s more work to be done, for medical staff and for Chicagoans. According to the latest figures from the state, Illinois has now seen 868 deaths and 23,247 coronavirus cases.

“The public must continue to do their part by practicing social distancing and staying home as much as possible,” Stuck said in a release. “There will be more milestones to come, both happy and tragic. And our actions now will determine how much celebrating or grieving we do later. We’re all in this together.”",1

491,491,603,A majority of coronavirus deaths in the US were in disproportionately black counties,"Half of all COVID-19 cases and nearly 60 percent of deaths due to the disease in the US occurred in counties that are disproportionately black, according to newly released data that is still being reviewed by scientists. The numbers of COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths are also higher in counties with a bigger proportion of black residents, the new analysis shows.

Only 22 percent of counties in the United States are disproportionately black, but the people within them have endured the majority of deaths in the country. These findings are the most comprehensive evidence we have yet showing how the novel coronavirus is taking a heavier toll on African Americans since national demographic data on race has so far been incomplete. An accurate picture of who is hardest hit is needed so that these disparities don’t play out again when it comes to who can get a vaccine and treatments as these become available, researchers say.

“We might see history repeat itself”

“Unfortunately, we might see history repeat itself when a vaccine becomes available,” Gregorio Millett, the study’s lead investigator, said in a press call. “That’s why it’s important to have studies like this and other studies that come out to show where COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths are concentrated to make sure that these marginalized populations are among the first to have access.”

This study was released today on the website of amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research to allow other scientists to comment on it. The results may change before it is finalized and published. The foundation worked in collaboration with Emory University, Johns Hopkins, O’Neill Institute, Georgetown University, and the University of Mississippi Medical Center. They analyzed data on the pandemic collected on or before April 13th.

The racial breakdown of COVID-19 cases has trickled out from states and cities since March. More than 80 percent of coronavirus patients hospitalized in Georgia were black, according to a recent sample taken by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of 305 patients. That’s despite black residents making up less than one-third of the population. But the CDC’s national data is still missing the races of more than 55 percent of COVID-19 cases nationwide.

Lawmakers have urged the Department of Health and Human Services to collect racial and ethnic demographics. “Lack of information will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in vulnerable communities,” they wrote in a March 27th letter to the agency. “Existing racial disparities and inequities in health outcomes and health care access may mean that the nation’s response to preventing and mitigating its harms will not be felt equally in every community.”

“the nation’s response to preventing and mitigating its harms will not be felt equally”

More than 90 percent of the disproportionately black counties studied are in the South. But the researchers found that cases and deaths were higher in African American communities, regardless of whether the area was more rural or more urban.

In New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic, there are stark differences in the rates of hospitalizations and deaths by county, according to a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The Bronx has the highest proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and higher death and hospitalization rates than New York City’s other boroughs, which each have their own counties. Manhattan is predominately white, and it has the lowest rates for deaths and hospitalizations.

The new national study also highlighted that rates of being uninsured, living in crowded households, and being exposed to more air pollution were also higher in counties that were disproportionately black — all factors associated with making it harder for these communities to stay healthy. These counties were also less likely to social distance compared to other counties, based on location data from cellphones. The study also noted that African Americans are more likely to be essential workers who aren’t able to work from home, despite shelter-in-place orders.

While the data is still emerging, it’s not necessarily surprising to public health experts who have worked to end racial disparities in a broad range of health outcomes that are a result of long-standing economic and social barriers. “It’s the social conditions that we have created,” says, David Williams, a professor of public health at Harvard, told The Verge in April. “I hope this is a wake up call for America.”",1
128,128,180,Legalizing pot deliveries gains momentum during coronavirus crisis,"As Illinoisans are ordered to hunker down to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, calls to allow legal marijuana deliveries have increased.

State Rep. Sonya Harper (D-Chicago) introduced legislation last month that would allow cannabis dispensaries to deliver marijuana to both medical pot patients and recreational customers. Now, she’s calling on Gov. J.B. Pritzker to take immediate action amid the rising public health crisis.

Related How recreational weed went from illegal to essential in 3 months

“I would be happy to see if the governor maybe could make a special executive order allowing that, or us being able to get that legislation through maybe quicker than normal this year to provide for that,” said Harper, who co-sponsored the bill that legalized pot statewide at the start of the year.

That landmark piece of legislation didn’t include a provision allowing deliveries, though lawmakers discussed the prospect while it was being drafted.

Curbside pickup allowed

Harper’s push to allow pot deliveries in the wake of the coronavirus crisis comes two weeks after officials allowed retailers to temporarily sell medical marijuana outside stores to protect patients who may be susceptible to COVID-19. The state’s more than 100,000 medical users can also have a registered caretaker pick up pot products for them.

Harper acknowledged that setting up a system for deliveries would be “more difficult” than allowing those curbside sales.

“It would entail basically giving all municipalities and everybody across the state the ability to open up deliveries,” she said. “It would also be creating a new type of license.”

Pritzker’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment, but state officials appear to be mulling whether to open up deliveries. A representative of a major Illinois cannabis firm, who asked not to be named, said the company has been included in some recent conversations.

“The state has been open-minded to evaluating and implementing new processes for the convenience of medical patients during this crisis, like curbside pickup, and conversations about how home delivery would work have definitely been part of that dialogue,” the industry insider said.

Margo Vesely, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said her group has recently been lobbying lawmakers to allow deliveries to medical patients.

“I think that we have to really hone in and focus on those that have those compromised immune systems and really look out for them at these times,” said Vesely. “Medical patients, if they have a weakened immune system, can’t be going into the dispensaries. And if they don’t have a caretaker, they’re stuck.

“So it would be really beneficial for them,” she added.

Harper noted that she’s recently seen people waiting to get inside dispensaries and that curbside sales are also attracting lines of cars. As officials institute strict measures to promote social distancing, she said “mobile delivery is probably needed in this time more than ever.”

However, Harper said it’s unclear whether home deliveries could be established without legislative approval, like curbside pickups. Passing her bill quickly through the Legislature also seems unrealistic, as the coronavirus has shut down sessions in Springfield for weeks.

“As it stands right now, the bill hasn’t even been heard in committee yet,” said Harper. “So we really haven’t even had a chance to discuss it, to even see any way that the bill needs to be changed or amended to meet the different needs of the different municipalities.”

“I think if we had the political will we could get together in a room and put that together now, but I do see things like that maybe taking time to figure out the details.”",1
747,747,914,FTC Shuts Down Dr. Brownstein's Blog for Explaining How He was Curing COVID-19 Patients,"by Brian Shilhavy

Editor, Health Impact News

We have featured the articles published by Michigan physician Dr. David Brownstein for many years here at Health Impact News.

But we were just notified that his blog has been shut down, apparently to suppress the information he was publishing that went against Big Pharma and their narrative regarding COVID-19.

As we have previously reported, Dr. Brownstein has had tremendous success treating COVID-19 patients successfully with holistic non-pharmaceutical methods.

According to a notice put up on his website, the FTC ordered him to stop blogging:

Dear CHM Patients-

I want to let you know that we have been ordered by the FTC to stop making any statements about our treatment protocols of Vitamins A, C and D as well as nutritional IV’s, iodine, ozone and nebulization to support the immune system with respect to Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19). According to this letter: “It is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C Sec. 41 et seq. to advertise that a product or service can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made. For COVID-19, no such study is currently known to exist for the products or services identified above. Thus, any Coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims regarding such products or services are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. You must immediately cease making all such claims.” What this means is that I will not be able to blog, post, tweet, email, etc. for awhile. I want you to know that CHM is NOT closing. I am still here and so are my colleagues. It is my honor to be your doctor. To All Our Health! ~DrB

The articles we have published on our website authored by Dr. Brownstein remain, and are protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.

Unfortunately, as a licensed physician, Dr. Brownstein has stricter regulations on what he can publish since he charges for his services.

This does NOT mean he has done anything wrong or illegal, it just probably means he has neither the time nor resources to fight this in court right now, where he would probably win on Constitutional grounds.

This was one of Dr. Brownstein’s last blog entries regarding the wearing of masks, which criticized Governor Whitmer (which is NOT illegal!).

We Must Wear Face Masks? Show Me the Science Behind That!

by Dr. Brownstein

Folks, I have been writing to you about COVID for over a month. It is been a painful time period for all of us.

What is really sad is that too many political dictates are being fostered on us without any good scientific evidence to back them up. One of those requirements that has me irritated is the use of face coverings that I see so prevalent out there.

When I go to Costco, 95% of the people in the store are wearing face masks.

Why is that?

The Governor of Michigan recently released an edict requiring that citizens wear a face covering when in any enclosed public space.

It specifically states, “Any individual able to medically tolerate a face covering must wear a covering over his or her nose and mouth—such as a homemade mask, scarf, bandana, or handkerchief—when in any enclosed public space.”

Later in the edict, it states, “Supplies of N95 masks and surgical masks should generally be reserved, for now, for health care professionals, first responders and other critical workers who interact with the public.”

It should be well known that cloth masks, bandanas, or handkerchiefs will do very little to stop the spread of coronavirus. In fact, they may actually increase your risk of becoming ill from corona and other influenza-like illnesses.

A 2015 study found cloth masks, when compared to surgical masks, increase the rate of influenza-like illnesses 13x! (1) Cloth masks are probably best avoided and should not be reused without properly sanitizing them.

Regular surgical masks are not much better in this situation. The COVID-19 virus is 0.125 µm in size. Surgical masks have been shown to not adequately filter against aerosols measuring from 0.9-3.1 µm. (2)

Other researchers have shown that particles from 0.04-0.2 µm can penetrate surgical masks. (3)

A 2020 study in Seoul, South Korea looked at the effectiveness of surgical and cotton masks in blocking COVID-19 in a controlled comparison of four patients. (4)

The COVID-infected patients were put in negative pressure isolated rooms. The scientists compared disposable surgical masks (3 layers) with reusable cotton masks.

Patients were instructed to cough 5 times while wearing no mask, surgical mask, or cotton mask. Interestingly, all swabs from the outer masks—including surgical masks—were positive for COVID-19.

Inner masks were also found to be contaminated. That means the mask did not effectively filter out the COVID virus since it is too small. The authors state, “Neither surgical nor cotton masks effectively filtered {COVID-19} during coughs by infected patients.”

The study also reported greater contamination on the outer than the inner mask (both surgical and cotton) surfaces.

The authors claim that the mask is either allowing the virus to cross from the inner to the outer surface because the virus is too small or the aerodynamic feature of a mask could explain this finding. A turbulent jet due to air leakage around the mask edge could contaminate the outer surface.

We have made far too many political decisions in the COVID crisis based on fear and not on reliable data. Here is a perfect example of another one: everyone must wear a mask when inside any public place.

Should you wear a mask? If you are coughing or sick, my answer is yes. A surgical mask, and to a lesser extent a cotton mask, will block large droplets from being spread.

However, should we dictate to healthy people that they are required to wear a mask—cotton or surgical—when in any public enclosed space? Someone show me the science supporting the Executive Order by the Governor of Michigan. And Governor Whitmer wonders why so many of us are annoyed.

Addendum: A further annoyance is my lack of success in getting masks—both N95 and surgical masks– for my staff to use when we are treating COVID patients. Perhaps the Governor should release an executive order helping us get the PPE equipment we need. We have had masks, gowns and face shields on order for over two months. That is beyond annoying.

285,285,365,Instagram’s cofounders built a website to track state-by-state spread of COVID-19,"Using data from the Covid Tracking Project, the cofounders of Instagram created a website to track the state-by-state spread of COVID-19 in the US, Bloomberg News reported.

The website, RT.live, uses a statistic known in epidemiology as the effective reproduction number. It tracks the average number of people who catch the virus from one infected person.

“We’re trying to take what is a complex topic and boil it down to a simple number that anyone can view from their home,” former Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom told Bloomberg.

The Covid Tracking Project, where RT.live gets its data, is an all-volunteer initiative that collects data from trustworthy known sources, such as public health authorities, and reports state-by-state details about the number of COVID-19 tests given, whether they’re positive or negative, the number of hospitalizations and number of deaths.

Systrom told Bloomberg the goal with RT.live was to help give people a better understanding of what the spread of the virus looks like at the local level.

He and fellow Instagram cofounder Mike Krieger left the company in 2018, six years after it was acquired by Facebook. Neither one has a background in health or epidemiology, according to Bloomberg.",1
1180,1180,1496,Trump's drug surprise triggers a White House playbook: Defend and clean up,"Trump’s unsolicited announcement reflected the president’s personal concerns about the coronavirus, a threat he spent months publicly downplaying only to see it infiltrate his inner circle in recent weeks. He started taking the drug around the same time two White House staffers tested positive for the coronavirus. The decision also showed Trump’s penchant for bucking the establishment — in this case, an alarmed medical community that has been skeptical about hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness in helping combat coronavirus.

“I think that most people kind of expected he was on this or some other kind of prophylactic from the beginning,” said Jason Miller, a senior communications adviser for Trump’s 2016 campaign and co-host of the podcast “War Room.” “You’ve got people in the White House who have got it, he’s shaking a number of hands, you look at someone like [British Prime Minister] Boris Johnson having it, and the fact that the president has been so healthy through this, people probably suspected he was on something.”

Many of the key questions about the president’s use of hydroxychloroquine remained unanswered Tuesday: How much he’s taking, how long he planned to take it and how it would interact with his existing heart medication. Trump's physician said only that he and the president had made the decision together.

Instead, throughout the day, Trump simply defended his use of the drug, saying he believed hydroxychloroquine “gives you an additional level of safety” and “doesn’t hurt people,” and said “people are going to have to make up their own mind” regarding the drug’s efficacy. The White House declined to comment beyond Trump's remarks.

“This is an individual decision to make,” Trump told reporters after meeting with Republican senators on Capitol Hill. “But it’s had a great reputation, and if it was somebody else other than me, people would say, ‘Gee, isn’t that smart?’”

Yet recent research on the drug has not given it a great reputation for treating or preventing the novel coronavirus that has raced around the world, infecting upward of 1.5 million Americans and killing more than 90,000 of them so far.

In observational studies, the treatment has shown limited or no benefits for coronavirus patients, and may even cause heart problems like arrhythmia. And there are only limited results from studies on whether hydroxychloroquine could be effective as a prophylactic measure. More extensive studies are currently in the works.

Still, Trump has promoted the drug for weeks, encouraging Americans to take it. His proselytizing has led to a hydroxychloroquine shortage, which has had serious ramifications for people who have long used the drug to treat lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.",1
1169,1169,1480,Coronavirus slashes emissions (for now),"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1
202,202,272,Coronavirus: We're in this together,"We're watching the coronavirus curve rocket northward on the graph like a rollercoaster off its rails. The statistics are shifting and shapeless as sand. The uncertainty makes it hard to breathe. The grief is upon us, in waves, and the worst, we fear, still lies ahead.

Yet hour by hour we march forward. We reach out through windows and screens to parents we fear we may never hug again. We find ways to help a neighbor or a nurse. We leave a pack of gloves for the trash collector. We pick up an extra jug of milk for a friend. We take to the streets and burst into ragged song, and we laugh. We welcome new babies into an uncertain, confusing world, and we allow ourselves to be overtaken by the world's oldest and most elemental joy. We learn to appreciate every breath.

Stories can infuse meaning into events that feel random and cruel. They are our history and our guide. The stories here remind us that others have survived this and worse, and that we can find, in so much churning loss, kernels of resolve.

We're proud to bring you these stories – human moments of resilience and sacrifice and celebration and faith. If you know of someone we should write about, send us a note. We'd love to tell your story, too.

1366,1372,1895,"As Americans lose their jobs, Senate gears up to give Israel A MINIMUM of $38 billion over 10 years","With the US economy reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee agreed to give Israel a minimum of $3.8 billion in military aid per year. A full vote on the gift is expected soon.

The US unemployment rate now stands at 14.7 percent, the worst figure since records began. Nearly 39 million Americans have lost their jobs since the coronavirus reached US shores in late January, and the Congressional Budget Office warned on Tuesday that the US economy won’t recover from its current contraction until after next year. Moreover, the federal government’s financial relief packages to date have pushed national debt past a record $25 trillion.

You wouldn’t think there was anything wrong if you asked Senator Marco Rubio though. The Florida Republican and his colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee quietly approved a bill on Thursday to guarantee Israel a minimum of $38 billion in military aid over the next ten years, despite the economic shambles at home.

Passed unanimously, the bill now heads to the Senate floor for a full vote.

Though authored by Rubio – a Republican of hawkish persuasion – the bill aims to legally codify a promise made by former President Barack Obama in 2016. Under the terms agreed to by Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Jewish state would not seek any additional funds beyond the annual $3.8 billion. Indeed, when Congress voted on an earlier version of Rubio’s bill in 2018, that figure was set as a cap. The 2018 bill was eventually rolled into another Middle East security bill the following year, which was left to die in the Democrat-controlled House.

spending cap has been removed. In the version passed by the Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday, the US will send “not less than” $3.3 billion in direct military aid and $500 million in funding for missile defense programs every year for the next decade.

Rubio boasted on Thursday that the bill “strengthens our nation’s strategic security alliance with Israel, a vibrant democracy that faces growing and unprecedented threats to its security and stability.” Yet the bill was passed with no fanfare, and in a state of near-secrecy.

The Foreign Relations Committee voted on it alongside a package of 15 other bills, with committee head Jim Risch (R-Idaho) foregoing the usual live-streaming of proceedings. Some of Risch and Rubio’s Democratic colleagues voiced concerns about the hush-hush nature of the session, but none objected to passing the bill, which amounts to the largest such aid package in American history.

The vote was not covered by American media, and was noted by only a few anti-Israel activists. Should the full Senate vote attract more coverage, it will likely draw some criticism. Even before the coronavirus hammered the US economy, support for Israel among the American public was falling. According to a Gallup poll taken late last year, 59 percent of Americans sympathized with Israel in the Middle East conflict, down from 64 percent a year earlier.

870,870,1042,"With over 200 possible cases, doctors warn reports of rare, coronavirus-linked child inflammatory illness likely to rise","With over 200 possible cases, doctors warn reports of rare, coronavirus-linked child inflammatory illness likely to rise Over half of reported cases are in New York, but at least 20 states see cases.

Medical professionals in 20 states and Washington D.C. are investigating more than 200 confirmed or suspected cases of a mysterious illness thought to be linked to the coronavirus and affecting children, according to a new ABC News survey of hospital and state health officials across the country. And while the unexplained syndrome is believed to be extremely rare, experts said they expect the number to grow.

Experts said the inflammatory syndrome, recently named by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), resembles toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease, itself a rare inflammatory disease typically affecting children under the age of five, and has the potential to be deadly. At least three children have died with the syndrome in New York, where at least an additional 119 cases are under investigation, according to the New York State Department of Health.

While the CDC says the group of symptoms is ""associated with"" COVID-19, exact cause remains a mystery.

Many kids, though not all, who experience symptoms of MIS-C -- which include fever, rash, eye irritation, swollen lymph nodes and/or swelling of the hands and feet -- either have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or tested positive for the antibodies, said health experts. And doctors say even those that have tested negative for antibodies could test positive later because of the lag in antibody development.

According to the CDC, It typically takes one to three weeks after someone becomes infected with the novel coronavirus for their body to make antibodies, and some people could take longer than that.

The illness is only a small percentage of the 1.5 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. Dr. Courtney Gidengil, a pediatric infectious disease physician and a policy researcher at the thinktank RAND, said the syndrome is incredibly rare, and parent’s should not panic.

But Gidengil warned the U.S. should expect to see the number of reported cases of the mystery illness rise.

“It seems like it takes four to six weeks for [MIS-C] to develop after infection, not due to the virus itself but rather the body’s response to the illness,” Gidengil said. ""We probably will start to see it pop up more around the entire country.”

There is no current official tally of suspected incidents of the illness nationwide, but an ABC News survey of hospital and state health officials in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. found at least 220 confirmed or possible cases of the illness. The majority of possible cases have been reported in New York, but more than a dozen have also been reported in New Jersey and Michigan, and officials said they also saw potential cases in Massachusetts, Washington D.C., Connecticut, California, Utah, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington State, Tennessee, Mississippi, Missouri, Georgia and Minnesota.

Some other states like Maryland and North Carolina have told ABC News they don’t have any confirmed cases but are monitoring for any suspected cases.

""I'll wager that's going to only go up and it's going to be much more widespread than anyone thinks,"" New York's Cuomo said.

The CDC sent a warning Thursday to thousands of doctors to be on the lookout for the illness, which was previously known as pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome, or PMIS. Friday the government agency said that surveillance of the disease ""is limited,"" but ""now that the case definition and [a health alert] are out, more info is likely to follow.""

Health departments across the country said they have already been on the lookout. Doctors in the U.K., Italy and Spain reported an increase in cases there last month.

The Michigan health department sent out an alert earlier this month to local health agencies and health care providers about the disease and a reminder to report suspected cases within 24 hours. To date, there are 17 suspected cases under review in the state, Michigan health department spokesperson Lynn Sutfin told ABC News. New Jersey, which has reported a total of 18 cases as of Wednesday, sent out their own alert earlier this month as well.

A doctor in Oregon told ABC News proper knowledge about the illness allowed an afflicted eighth grader to get treatment immediately, which ultimately helped save her.

""I'm very grateful because I could have been gone,"" 14-year old Leah said in an interview with ABC . ""I'm glad I got help right away.""

In California, the state has yet to declare the syndrome a reportable illness, but hospitals have been paying close attention as early as March. Dr. Jim Stein, chief medical officer at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, said the illness is a sign that the impact of the novel coronavirus is extending to children in a way that “this is no longer considered necessarily less significant for children than it is for adults.”

The CDC alert said that “It is currently unknown if multisystem inflammatory syndrome is specific to children or if it also occurs in adults.”

But little is known about the illness' connection to COVID-19.

Of the 16 children with inflammatory symptoms in California, 14 have been tested for coronavirus antibodies, Stein said. None of them had tested positive for the coronavirus detection at the time they were admitted to the hospital, but four of them tested positive later. Stein added that the 10 patients that tested negative could also develop antibodies later.

Dr. Andrew Pavia, who has been monitoring two suspected cases at the University of Utah Health Primary Children’s Hospital, said treatments given to patients with the toxic shock related symptoms could also interfere with antibody tests for COVID-19, further complicating the efforts to identify any link between the two.

Health experts are also going back to their current and past patients as they examine more patients and the case definition of the illness broadens from the classic Kawasaki disease, which could increase the number of cases brought forth.

“There's just a lot to worry about with respect to kids,” Alker said. “We really need a national strategy we need our leaders to sort of thoughtfully consider and address this wide range of threats that children face right now to their health and development.”

“And unfortunately there's just no sign that exists right now,” Alker added.

With new illness, questions about summer camps, schools re-opening

The sudden rise in critically ill children, albeit extremely small nationwide, has only further ignited the debate surrounding reopening, especially when it comes to schools.

Most states have decided that school openings will occur on a local level, and for nearly the entire country that decision still hangs in the balance. But the start of summer camps and summer programs is just around the corner, and many states have already moved to allow them to go on. States including Georgia, Tennessee, and Connecticut all have possible cases of MIS-C they have been monitoring in their state but have said summer camps may reopen with various forms of social distancing in place.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, repeatedly warned lawmakers during a hearing on Tuesday about opening schools and businesses too soon, which he said could cause further outbreaks.

“We don't know everything about this virus and we really better be very careful particularly when it comes to children,"" Dr. Fauci warned.

But some lawmakers have been quick to dismiss the warnings, eagerly pushing to open schools in the fall, which are seen as a major indicator of the country being officially opened.

Sen. Rand Paul, R- Kentucky, pushed back on Fauci's calls for cautiousness and said it would be a “huge mistake” not to let kids return to school sooner. President Trump also told reporters Wednesday that he was “surprised” by Fauci’s comments. He said it was “not an acceptable answer.”

""I think that we have to open our schools,"" Trump said in an interview on Wednesday. ""Young people are very little affected by this. We have to get the schools open.""

In Connecticut, where Gov. Ned Lamont and hospitals have recently confirmed that at least five children in the state are being monitored and treated for the new syndrome, the state’s Office of Early Childhood announced this week that summer camps, with the exception of overnight camps, can open on June 29 with specific guidance in place, including a requirement to get a permission to host a group more than 30 as well as other social distancing measures. When schools can reopen there remains a question, as Education Commissioner Miquel Cardona said this week that the school reopening plan will depend on infection trends and that they will need to be flexible.

Georgia Gov. Kemp has implemented a similar measure. Summer camps were permitted to begin operating this week, as long as they follow 32 mandatory criteria that his team developed in absence of the CDC’s guidance. Overnight camps are prohibited. Kemp's office did not respond to a request for comment about how the new illnesses in the state would impact his decisions about schools moving forward.

In most other states, some summer camps are opening up while some other camps are choosing to remain closed amid state governments’ lack of state-wide directives.

In Maryland, Montgomery County this week went ahead and cancelled all summer camps in the county as it awaits for state health department's guidance for camps. Guidance on summer camps is pending in Michigan and Massachusetts as well, while Missouri has left it to counties and cities to decide on the fate of summer camps.

In Utah, the Girl Scouts of Utah has extended the cancellation of “in-person meetings for troops and services of units” until June 30, but YMCA of Northern Utah is moving ahead with its camps while adhering to CDC social distancing guidelines. Schools remain closed through the end of the academic year.

An 'additional risk to consider'

Early concerns about re-opening schools had more to do with the possibility of children potentially transmitting the coronavirus to their teachers, parents or elderly grandparents, who have shown to be much more susceptible to COVID-19's more serious effects.

Pavia said that the new ""scary illness"" affecting kids, while very rare, has only added to the difficult safety calculations.

“I think it's one more factor to put into the very complex decision making about letting kids go back to school in the fall or the summer camps,” Pavia said. “We know that overall they're likelihood of getting severe respiratory disease is very low. We think that MIS-C is a rare but very serious complication, and you know how it's hard to make decisions about rare but serious events.”

“I think for schools, it's just an additional risk to consider,” Pavis added. “I still think that for deciding whether to open schools, the bigger concern is what role children may play in prolonging the epidemic and infecting older people. That's likely to be a much larger impact in terms of numbers. Psychologically, this may have a bigger role.”

In the meantime, health experts are urgently trying to get the word out about the disease so parents can know identify and get their children medical attention as soon as possible.

“Parents: know the signs of Pediatric Multi-Symptom Inflammatory Syndrome to protect your child,” New York City blasted out in its text-message notification system on Friday.

""This is truly disturbing,"" Gov. Cuomo said of the illness at a press conference this week. ""We raise it because it's something parents should be aware of.""

The logs will include contact information that will contribute to the state's efforts to trace potential coronavirus infections.

The daily logs are required to be saved for only 30 days.

Eight Washington counties have received the OK to move forward with the second phase of reopening, which includes allowing restaurants to offer dine-in service at 50 percent capacity, according to the Seattle Times.

Gov. Jay Inslee's rules require restaurants that reopen to keep a daily log of customers, including their names and contact information. The logs are to be kept for 30 days, when they can be used to trace coronavirus infections.

There have been 17,773 confirmed cases and 993 deaths from COVID-19 in the state, according to date from Johns Hopkins University.

As businesses in the counties cleared for limited reopening get rolling, there are 13 regulations that they must adhere to.

In addition to the log, they will also be required to move tables far enough that there is a 6-foot distance between guests at different tables.

The state is also urging restaurants to require face coverings even when guests are not seated at their tables. Bar seating and buffets are not permitted.

Restaurants are required to provide hand sanitizer to staff and guests and screen employees for signs of COVID-19 at the beginning of each shift. A COVID-19 supervisor must be assigned to enforce the site's safety plans.

Before any restaurant is allowed to open, the state requires they demonstrate that they can meet all of the requirements.",1

Escalating tensions over China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic could be a ""major risk"" to economic recovery —and may even lead to a trade war worse than the one between Beijing and Washington, one investor told CNBC.

From the U.S. to Europe to Australia, more and more world leaders are calling for China to be investigated over the origins of the outbreak, which was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late December.

As economies prepare to reopen again after weeks of lockdown to stem the virus' spread, recovery could be derailed by political tensions, said David Sokulsky, CEO and chief investment officer of Concentrated Leaders Fund.

""That's a major risk which isn't being priced in at the moment,"" he told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Thursday.

""As we pass peak infection rates, the politicians are going to want to blame somebody, and the obvious target for that blame is China,"" he added.",1
476,476,582,"Why we long for cafes, barber shops and other ‘third places’ to reopen","Social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic implies many painful losses. Among them are so-called “third places” — the restaurants, bars, gyms, houses of worship, barber shops and other places we frequent that are neither work nor home.

The third place is a concept in sociology and urban planning that recognizes the role these semi-public, semi-private places play in fostering social association, community identity and civic engagement. In giving people a familiar setting for social interaction among regulars, they encourage “place attachment” — the bond between a person and a place.

Opinion

Now, experiencing the coronavirus from the fortress of our living spaces, we may enjoy being in a haven. But we’ve lost the social and psychological intimacy of third places.

It‘s a significant loss. My three decades of research on urban spaces finds that both public spaces and third places contribute to a healthy, flourishing society.

Places to ‘feel at home’

Third spaces have probably always existed. From social clubs and religious gatherings to neighborhood festivals and burial societies, people have long formed associations bringing groups together.

Most of these associations reflected genealogical, religious, gender, cultural or class homogeneity. Often, they were formed to fulfill a social function, like raising funds. They were not necessarily located in a particular place.

Contemporary third places, in contrast, are always space-based. When urbanists use the term, they’re referring to a physical setting with a boundary or entrance designed to allow, even encourage, access to a variety of people — like a coffee shop with a bright sign and an open door.

Staff and regulars are part of the scene. But so are strangers. While not as diverse or accessible as public spaces, third places rely on a certain amount of heterogeneity to convey social importance and bring vitality.

In this way, third places complement public spaces like parks, plazas, playgrounds, streets and sidewalks — free and open places that offer contact, cooperation and even conflict with a range of mostly unknown people.

If public spaces expand our social relationships and liberalize our world view, third places anchor us to a community where we are recognized and our needs accommodated. Third places are predictable and comfortable, a setting where we feel “at home.”

‘It is not the same’

Those sheltering in place are now missing their third places acutely.

Recently, I spoke with some young men who are still gathering in a local state park near my home. They were sharing a pizza, hidden from view. They told me how hard it is not to be able to hang out at the pizza shop itself. It was their third place.

Grace, an older friend from Manhattan, told me she feels “cut off” because she can’t go to the neighborhood restaurant where she knows the chef by name and enjoys sitting at the bar after work.

I still get coffee every morning at the Golden Pear on the east end of Long Island, where I live, wearing a mask and gloves. Normally, I’d eat breakfast there while exchanging greetings and conversing in English and Spanish with friends and staff.

Now I take my coffee to an empty beach to drink. It is not the same.

As my colleague Judy Ling Wong observes, from London, where she lives alone, this lockdown is a time of “severe disorientation.”

Phoning friends has almost a “ritualistic feel to it,” she writes. It is “done to maintain our hold on social connections.”

Gated against coronavirus

Our collective loneliness during the pandemic exposes how dependent we are on one another for happiness and how interconnected we really are.

Healthy societies depend on continuing interaction among people who are different in multiple ways. Third places are prime venues for such interactions because our shared enjoyment — a love of coffee, music, or working out — assures that even strangers have at least one thing in common.

I have studied people who live in gated communities, places bereft of such diverse interactions. Even in a supposedly secured space, they worry about crime and feel anxiety when they walk outside the gates of their neighborhood. Children who grow up in such places learn, implicitly or intentionally, to fear those outside the walls, including their own families’ workers, nannies or delivery people.

Because of the potential of contagious strangers, the coronavirus creates a similar us-versus-them mentality. Without third places and public spaces where people come into regular contact with others outside their circle, such thinking can become ingrained. It can metastasize from prudent public health advice to paranoia and prejudice.

The coronavirus challenges not only our physical, mental and economic health but also our social health.

Third places provide the daily glue that binds us to a particular location and the people who frequent it. With them, we construct a chosen community, a broader public realm. Without them, I worry, the associations that weave a complex society together will fray.

It's hard out there. And, in this time of uncertainty, USA TODAY is working to find answers to your money questions – anything from stimulus checks or unemployment benefits to your 401(k) or retirement plans. You can submit your questions here and read earlier answers below.

We will be updating the Q&A, so check back often. But, also look to these places:

How long will I receive unemployment and how long will I receive the extra federal $600?

Answer: It depends on where you live. Workers in most states are eligible for up to 26 weeks of unemployment benefits from regular state-funded unemployment compensation, but some states allow for fewer weeks. Under a new federal law, you can receive an extra $600 per week from April 5, 2020 until July 31, 2020.

Why is the status of the IRS Get My Payment tool listed as: 'No Payment Information is Available'?

... I filed my 2018 tax return and owed money. But I did not file my 2019 tax return. I fall within the income guidelines to receive a $1,200 check.

Ken Milani, professor of accountancy at the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame, notes that the IRS doesn’t have the information it needs to make a direct deposit of the stimulus payment when you’ve owed money on that 2018 tax return. The IRS had a noon May 13 deadline to use Get My Payment at IRS.gov to supply direct deposit information.

Follow Susan on Twitter: @tompor.

How can I know if my direct deposit is right?

Will I get my CARES relief if the bank account on file with the IRS is closed and charged off?

I checked the IRS website to see where my payment is and it said it was deposited in that account.

Ken Milani, professor of accountancy at the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame, suggests that you first contact the bank to see what happened there. If the bank has the money, be prepared to verify your identity. Most likely, the money may have been returned to the IRS.

The IRS states at its Economic Impact Payments Information Center, Question No. 33, that: “If the account is closed or no longer active, the bank will reject the deposit and you will be issued a check that will be mailed to the address we have on file for you. This is generally the address on your most recent tax return or as updated through the United States Postal Service (USPS). You do not need to call the IRS to change your Payment method or update your address at this time.”

In addition, the IRS states: “As required by law and for security reasons, a letter about the Payment will be mailed to each recipient’s last known address within 15 days after the Payment is made. The letter will provide information on how the Payment was made and how to report any failure to receive the Payment.”

I don't have the same bank account as I did in 2018. I was issued a stimulus check, minus back child support. Where is the remaining money and where will the IRS send it?

According to the IRS, if a stimulus check is sent to a recipient through direct deposit and the bank information is invalid or the bank account has been closed, the bank will reject the deposit. At that point, the IRS will mail the payment as soon as possible to the address they have on file for you, typically within 14 days. You can learn more about accessing your payment through the GetMyPayment page on the IRS web site.

I'm a health care worker. Can I qualify for unemployment if my coworker has tested positive for COVID-19 and I now fear working at the facility?

My coworker may have gotten Covid-19 from a patient at his second job. Because of this, I fear that I have been exposed to the virus and that if I continue to work at the facility, I will continue to be exposed.

Generally, you can only qualify for unemployment if you lost your job due to COVID-19, you’ve left your job to take care of family member who’s been infected, or you’re quarantining on the advice of a health-care provider and you’re unable to perform your duties. The U.S. Department of Labor recommends that if you believe your employer’s response to the possible spread of COVID-19 creates “a serious safety hazard” or if you think your employer is not following federal work safety standards, you can file a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

I file my taxes thru TurboTax and get refunds on a debit card. Will my stimulus funds be deposited to the card?

Like many things relating to the Economic Impact Payments, there does not appear to be a clear cut answer here. TurboTax said: “We are seeing some TurboTax customers who chose to receive their refund on a debit card get their stimulus payments to these accounts. Any TurboTax debit card customer who receives a stimulus payment from the IRS to that account, will receive that stimulus payment without delay or fees.”

At the same time, TurboTax recommends that people check the IRS Get My Payment tool to find out how they will receive their stimulus payment from the IRS and when.

TurboTax noted that the IRS is responsible for determining taxpayer eligibility of receiving a stimulus and, if a taxpayer is eligible, how and when the stimulus payments will be delivered to them.

The IRS is asking people to submit direct deposit information by noon May 13 at Get My Payment at IRS.gov before a steady flow of paper checks will be issued.

How exactly do you return a stimulus check that was sent to a dead person?

... A family member just received her stimulus benefit via direct deposit. Thing is, she’s been dead for three years. Are we required to give the money back?

Here's what the IRS said people need to do if they must return an Economic Impact Payment, such as one issued to a deceased person.

If the payment was a paper check:

Write ""Void"" in the endorsement section on the back of the check.

Mail the voided Treasury check immediately to the appropriate IRS location listed below.

Don't staple, bend, or paper clip the check.

Include a note stating the reason for returning the check.

And if you cashed that paper check already, or you received the stimulus money via direct deposit, the IRS said you should:

Submit a personal check, money order, etc., immediately to the appropriate IRS location listed at IRS.gov.

Write on the check/money order made payable to “U.S. Treasury” and write 2020EIP, and the taxpayer identification number (Social Security number, or individual taxpayer identification number) of the recipient of the check.

Include a brief explanation of the reason for returning the EIP.

The IRS could try to charge you interest and penalties at some point if you do not return the money.

I was claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return. Can I file my own 2019 return and receive stimulus check?

If you were claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return for 2019, you are out of luck for now. However, the stimulus payments are technically an advance credit on your 2020 taxes, so you could possibly claim the payment when you file your 2020 returns early next year, as long as someone else does not claim you as a dependent for 2020.

... The jobs I qualify for are considered nonessential and it's dangerous to be out trying to find work right now while taking care of my elderly brother. We are receiving food stamps.

You may be eligible for a stimulus payment once you file a 2019 tax return. Current inmates cannot get a payment, but ex-offenders can qualify, even if they have no income. If you do not file with the IRS right now, you could be eligible for the stimulus payment when you file a 2020 return next year.

You also may be eligible for unemployment benefits, including the additional $600 per week in enhanced benefits that the federal government has approved to help mitigate the financial impact of the coronavirus. Rules for unemployment benefits vary from state to state, but to qualify, you usually need to be actively looking for work and cannot turn down a job offer.

I haven't gotten my stimulus check. Can I still get one?

The first thing to check is if you qualify to receive a stimulus check under the CARES Act guidelines. If you do, it's important to remember that the government is sending out the payments in installments.

Payments were prioritized in order from lowest income to highest income.

For those with direct deposit information on file with the IRS, payments began going out on April 10. And last week to Social Security beneficiaries, railroad retirees and veterans who aren’t required to file a tax return, which will continue through May.

While the IRS started mailing checks in late April to those who qualify but do not have direct deposit information, that process might take several months.

Regardless of how you filed, you can track your expected payment using the IRS Get My Payment tool. The timing of checks for those who filed paper returns last year is being complicated by the IRS' decision to stop processing paper returns due to COVID-19.

How unemployment benefits are calculated varies by state, but even those who don’t qualify for unemployment are automatically considered for the new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program that was created as part of the CARES Act. PUA aids people who are unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic but do not qualify for traditional unemployment insurance.

I am the director of a small business whose employees were furloughed. With the extra $600 a week plus state unemployment benefits, several people will be earning more on unemployment than working.

Bringing staff back at their regular wage through the Paycheck Protection Program will result in them earning less than they are getting on unemployment. This doesn't seem right. Why would they return?

Several Republican senators brought up the very same issue during the debate on the first stimulus bill passed in March, saying it would encourage some people to collect unemployment rather than work. But both the Trump administration and most Democrats argued the $600 boost was necessary because unemployment benefits alone in many states would not restore their full pay before the crisis. They don’t believe most workers, such as front-line health care responders, would choose staying home over staying on the job.

Will I get a stimulus check if I defaulted on my student loans?

Under the CARES Act, the government won’t withhold the money you owe for defaulted federal student loans out of your payment. It blocks the IRS from garnishing your tax refund for those late loan payments. Also, the government won't ding your wages or withhold social security payments for six months under the relief package.

... What if my tax refund was already garnished?

If your tax refund was withheld because you defaulted on a federal student loan on or after March 13, which was the day President Donald Trump declared a national emergency, it will be returned to you, according to the Department of Education. That also applies to garnished wages and withheld Social Security benefits.

... Does it apply to private loans?

Will my stimulus check be affected if I owe taxes?

... or child support?

... or overdue on student loan payments?

While the CARES Act suspends debts like overdue student loans or back taxes that typically lead to the garnishment of tax refunds, it doesn't apply to delinquent child support payments. That means the government's relief checks will still be garnished if you're overdue. And some spouses who are filing joint tax returns with their late-paying partners are upset their stimulus money is being trimmed or withheld, even if they typically qualify for relief in situations like tax refunds.

Even if your spouse is solely responsible for the debt, a shared tax refund or stimulus check could be at risk.

.... If I owe child support, does the stimulus money go to my ex?

The stimulus payment that is reduced or withheld by the child support owed will go to the appropriate collecting office for the taxpayer's state. From there, that collecting office will issue the money to the custodial parent, the person due the child support.

I just started my job and have not received any commission. How do I file for unemployment with no proof of income?

You may qualify for state benefits if the reason you haven’t been able to get your new business off the ground is because of the coronavirus crisis, such as a government-ordered shut down or the need to care for a child whose school has closed, says Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow with the Century Foundation, a nonprofit think tank. She can apply for relief under the CARES Act and should prepare to demonstrate what she did in regard to her business and how COVID-19 affected it.

How do I apply for the new small business loan to pay my rent and my employees?

Small businesses (those with 500 and fewer employees) can apply for a loan under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program that will cover eight weeks of operations and be fully forgiven if at least 75% of the money is used for payroll and the rest is for other other business-related expenses (such as rent/mortgage and utilities). You’ll have to download this form and then find an eligible lender, such as an SBA-certified local bank or commercial lender. You can still borrow the money if you don’t meet the 75% payroll requirement but you’ll have to pay it back with 1% interest within two years.

If I am afraid to go to work but haven't been laid off due to coronavirus, can I quit and collect unemployment?

No. Not unless you can show you were possibly exposed to the virus. Guidance in regard to the federal relief act specifically states that quitting a job without cause to get benefits would be deemed fraud.

Thinking about a small business loan to pay our employees, could that impact their unemployment claims?

At least 75% of the Paycheck Protection Program loan must be spent on payroll in order for it to be completely forgiven. If workers file for unemployment, that could compromise the small business or nonprofit organization's ability to meet the requirement.

SCAN, or the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network, was testing 300 people a day before it was ordered by the FDA to stop testing, and applications were to be made public soon.

A partnership between five local medical organizations and funded in part by the Gates Foundation, SCAN had only previously received FDA approval surveillance testing, which does not allow researchers to return test results to patients or doctors.

Since SCAN researchers returned test results to patients, the FDA specified that its testing protocol would need additional examination before it can receive emergency use authorization (EUA).

The US Food and Drug Administration has ordered a Bill Gates-backed coronavirus testing program in Seattle to discontinue indefinitely, The New York Times first reported. The testing program, which offered at-home testing kits to Seattle-area residents under authorization from Washington state, was ordered to stop activities and wait for additional approval from the FDA.

SCAN, or the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network, was testing 300 people a day before it was ordered by the FDA to stop testing, and applications were to be made public soon. In a May 12 blog post, Gates said that SCAN wasn't meant to replace widespread federal testing, but to ""paint a clearer picture of how COVID-19 is moving through the community, who is at greatest risk, and whether physical distancing measures are working.""

But, on May 14, SCAN's website posted an update saying the FDA required additional emergency use authorization (EUA) for self-collected coronavirus tests. The update specified that SCAN asked for EUA on April 13. ""There are no issues or concerns with the safety and accuracy of SCAN's test,"" the update said.

Instead, an FDA spokesperson told The Times, the issue seems to be with the categorization and use of SCAN's tests. The tests are categorized as surveillance tests, which can be used by researchers but cannot be given to patients or doctors for diagnostic purposes. Since SCAN was returning results to patients, the FDA said that the program needed to be subjected to guidelines for diagnostic testing.

SCAN was launched in early March with funding from the Gates Foundation, and was a collaboration between the Seattle and King County Public Health Department, the Brotman Baty Institute, the medicine faculty University of Washington, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and the Seattle Children's Hospital.

According to Gates' blog post, the testing program is an extension of an early flu research program he helped found in 2018, the Seattle Flu Study. The Seattle Flu Study, which previously tracked the spread of the flu during the 2018 season, detected the first coronavirus case in the United States in February.

The World Health Organization says widespread testing is necessary for stopping the pandemic. However, numbers show that the US still lags behind other countries in per-capita testing.",1
1271,1273,1680,UCLA report says minorities disproportionately affected by coronavirus,"California’s minority communities, particularly Latinos, Pacific Islanders and African Americans, are experiencing higher rates of coronavirus cases compared to Caucasians, according to a report released Thursday, May 21, by UCLA’s Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture.

The report, based on a study of COVID-19 exposure by six different age groups, found that almost in every age category, Latinos, African Americans and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders have higher case rates for COVID-19 than whites. This is an indicator that these racial populations are experiencing varying degrees of greater exposure to the virus than whites, said David E. Hayes-Bautista, professor of medicine and the center’s director.

For example, in the 0-17 age group, Latinos have the highest number of cases, with 31.8 per 100,000 people compared to 8.6 cases among whites. In the 18-34 age group, Pacific Islanders have nearly 300 cases per 100,000 compared to 72.9 among whites. The number of coronavirus cases gets higher among Latinos, African Americans and Pacific Islanders as the age of the individuals increases.

Latinos, in particular, are vulnerable because they serve in a lot of jobs at essential businesses, Hayes-Bautista said.

“They are the farm workers who grow and pick food, meat packers, truck drivers, grocery stockers, checkout clerks, auto mechanics, bus drivers and attendants in nursing homes,” he said. “They have a high rate of exposure. But they were also the last ones to get personal protective equipment like masks and gloves. So it’s not surprising at all that they have higher case rates.”

Latinos and Asians also tend to “live more densely,” and often multiple generations share the same home, Hayes-Bautista said.

“The cost of housing in California is horrendously high and wages for these essential workers are not very high,” he said. “So you have senior citizens, younger wage earners and children living together. When the wage earners or essential workers go to work and come back home, they are likely infecting the others in the home.”

New statistics released by the APM Research Lab on Wednesday, May 20, titled “The Color of Coronavirus,” showed that, nationwide, African Americans have died at a rate of 50.3 per 100,000 people compared with 20.7 for whites, 22.9 for Latinos and 22.7 for Asian Americans. Nationwide, more than 20,000 African Americans have died from the coronavirus.

Minority populations also suffer as a result of not being able to afford health insurance or obtain it because they are undocumented. Luz Gallegos, community programs director at the TODEC Legal Center, a Perris-based immigrant assistance group, said Latino immigrants, in particular, have been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic because of the Trump administration’s public charge rule that could deny green cards to immigrants who use social services such as food stamps, cash assistance or public housing, she said.

“People don’t want to get tested or be on the radar as having tested positive,” she said. “So they are spreading the virus within their families or within local communities.”

The unofficial start of summer is just over a week away!

But unfortunately, summer is canceled. Not to mention, the window to take advantage of cheap gas for your road trip is closing fast.

In Wisconsin — where gas was as low as 87 cents just weeks ago — the bottom is now up to a whopping $1.44. Who can even afford that?

Rising gas prices are just one sign that oil markets are starting to recover, in step with global oil demand. That's great news for an industry that faced one of the worst springs in history.

Now we're starting to ask: What will the energy industry look like when the pandemic is in the rearview?

For starters, we asked a bunch of CEOs.

We had the pleasure of interviewing eight top energy execs — from BP's Susan Dio to Duke Energy's Lynn Good — about how the coronavirus will change their companies and the industry at large.

Theme 1: The transition to low-carbon energy remains at center stage even as majors slash their budgets. 2020 forecasts aside, the pandemic won't do much to slow it down.

Theme 2: People are craving energy resilience, especially as wildfire and hurricane seasons draw near. That could give residential solar and infrastructure projects a boost.

Here are a few of the comments that stood out to me. You can read all of them here.

""California had one of the driest months of February in its history, and because of COVID-19, we've seen reports of fewer prescribed burns, which increases the risk of wildfires this fall,"" Sunrun's CEO Lynn Jurich said.

""We have a wire or a pipe connected to businesses in every county of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan,"" CMS Energy's CEO Patti Poppe said. ""The question for us in the midterm is how will those businesses come back.""

""We are a little bit worried about the electrification of transportation right now because I think the transportation sector is suffering a lot,"" Energy Impact Partners' CEO Hans Kobler said. ""Electric vehicle sales will be down 40%.""

I don't know what I'm eating for lunch or where I'll be living in two months, let alone what the world will look like in 20 years.

But if anyone is up for the task of predicting the future of energy, it's analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie. This week, they sketched out three paths that a recovery could take, and what each means for energy.

""Full recovery"": A coronavirus vaccine becomes available next year, and governments around the world pour money into spurring economic growth.

Oil demand returns to pre-pandemic levels of around 100 million barrels per day (bpd) in the 2020s and then reaches a peak of more than 110 million bpd by the mid-2030s.

Natural gas and cheap renewable energy sources would slowly replace coal, causing it to decline slightly by 2040.

""Go it alone"": The virus is tough to defeat, trade and travel are restricted, and the world suffers from a long recession.

Global demand for oil increases very little after an initial rebound.

""By 2030 it is barely any higher than was expected for 2020 if the pandemic had not hit,"" they said.

""Greener growth"": A short recession is followed by a strong rebound that includes government support for low-carbon energy.

Oil demand wouldn't move much for the next decade or so and then decline steeply in the 2030s.

Most remarkably, ""the combined share of oil, gas, and coal in total primary energy drops to 68% in 2040, down from 84% in 2019,"" the analysts said.

Oil prices have rallied in recent weeks, but the US shale industry — once synonymous with American energy dominance — is not exactly celebrating.

As we reported earlier this week, its problems began well before the coronavirus pandemic took root.

History lesson: In the last five years, US shale companies have failed to deliver investor returns and accrued billions of dollars of debt.

Investors made a lot of money when they invested on ""the dip"" around 2009, when oil prices were low.

Those investors helped fuel the fracking revolution of the 2010s, which supercharged America's oil output.

An unintended consequence was that fracking brought M&A — the main source of capital gains for investors — to a near standstill over the following years. (I explain why here.)

So when investors once again backed US shale in the last downturn, beginning around 2014, they never saw returns.

Where we are now: Of the 500 or so US oil and gas companies backed by private equity, about 400 of them don't have bids, according to an investor who's been tracking the industry for years.

That means they'll be forced to go into what he called ""blowdown"" — diverting cash from production to investors, causing oil output to decline over time.

US production could fall by as much as 4 million barrels of oil per day by the end of next year, the investor said.

Where we are headed: ""What you're seeing is the rapid shrinkage of the industry,"" he said. ""A lot of companies are going to cease to exist.""

913,913,1087,"Kristof: America’s true COVID-19 death toll already exceeds 100,000","Many supporters of President Donald Trump believe that the figures for coronavirus fatalities are inflated, and Trump himself shared a tweet doubting the accuracy of some virus figures.

He’s right that the death toll seems off — but not in the direction he would suggest. We’ve crunched the numbers, state by state, and it appears that somewhere around 100,000 to 110,000 Americans have already died as a result of the pandemic, rather than the 83,000 whose deaths have been attributed to the disease, COVID-19.

That’s my estimate reached with the help of a Harvard statistician, Rafael Irizarry, based on a comparison of death rates this spring with those in previous years. Some states have been largely unaffected — death rates in some even appear to have dropped, perhaps because of less driving and fewer car accidents — but others have seen huge surges in deaths.

Overall, in a bit more than two months, the United States lost more Americans to the coronavirus than died over seven decades in the Korean, Vietnam, Persian Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq Wars.

Here’s how we reached our estimates; they are not definitive, for they are based on preliminary data, and I invite discussion.

The starting point is that the cause of death is often uncertain. Most people who die don’t get an autopsy, and many never had a coronavirus test. The precise number who died from COVID-19 is in some sense unknowable.

Still, one standard approach to measure the impact of a pandemic like this is to look at “excess deaths,” meaning mortality greater than the average for a particular time period.

For example, for the seven weeks ending April 25 in the United States, about 70,000 more Americans died than is normal for those weeks (death is seasonal and normally declines over the course of spring and summer). That 70,000 figure for excess deaths does not include Connecticut, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, which were excluded because of missing or dubious data.

The official number of COVID-19 deaths in that period for the rest of the country was 49,100. That suggests an undercount of more than 20,000 coronavirus-related deaths as of April 25.

Add those 20,000 missed deaths to today’s total of 83,000, and you already get more than 100,000 pandemic-related deaths. But the undercount probably continued after April 25, albeit at a lower rate.

We don’t have good enough mortality data to assess excess deaths in late April and early May, a period in which more than 30,000 Americans are reported to have died of COVID-19. Testing increased significantly, and over time, doctors seemed more willing to list COVID-19 as the cause of death.

“There’s probably less underreporting as time goes on,” notes Robert N. Anderson, the chief of mortality statistics at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. In New York City, a study likewise found enormous underreporting in the first half of April, then gradually diminishing by the beginning of May.

In the period we looked at, the undercount also diminished. Initially, there were more than twice as many excess deaths as reported coronavirus deaths, but by April 25 there were only 40% more. If the undercount thereafter were 10%, that would add a few thousand to the total, possibly bringing it closer to 110,000.

These numbers are uncertain, but the implication is that somewhere around 25,000 more Americans died as a result of the pandemic than are recorded in the death tallies.

This kind of analysis can’t determine if they died directly from the virus or indirectly. Some presumably perished from heart attacks or strokes because they feared going to hospitals and delayed calling 911, or because ambulance services were stretched thin. In other words, a modest number presumably died because of the virus without being infected by it.

One reason to think that a great majority of the excess deaths are directly caused by the virus is that in some states that seem to have meticulous reporting, such as Massachusetts, the number of excess deaths and the number of COVID-19 deaths are not so far apart.

Irizarry, who is also chairman of the department of data science at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, notes that our new estimates are built on several layers of uncertainty. It typically takes two months for deaths to be reported in a reasonably complete way, so one critical issue is how to adjust for lags in reporting. The CDC tries to estimate what the death total will eventually be based on incomplete reporting, and our estimates depend on its algorithms.

The mortality figures show enormous variation by state. Texas and California appear to have suffered more deaths from the 2018 flu epidemic than from the coronavirus so far. And according to the CDC numbers, some states, including Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota and Rhode Island, actually experienced fewer deaths than normal in the seven weeks ending April 25. The reason might be a decline in driving and a drop in accidental deaths.

Irizarry calculates that about 70% of excess deaths nationally derive from just five states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts and Illinois.

The idea that official figures are undercounts is widely acknowledged. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci told a Senate health committee Tuesday that he didn’t know if the real death toll was 50% higher than the official figures, but that “almost certainly it’s higher.”

“Most frontline doctors will tell you that the numbers are grossly underreported,” said Michael P. Jones, an emergency medicine physician who works at hospitals in the Bronx that were particularly hard hit. Especially in the early days, he said, many COVID-19 deaths were simply listed as some variant of “respiratory failure” or “multisystem organ failure.”

Dr. Alicia Skarimbas, who practices in New Jersey, said, “We signed so many death certificates, we would get behind and take turns doing them.”

Skarimbas said that she would list COVID-19 as the cause of death when that seemed obvious, but her partners might simply list “respiratory failure” unless there had been a positive test for the virus. Thus it was often random whether COVID-19 was listed as the cause of death.

The undercounting is a global problem, not just one in the United States. Dr. Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington estimates that globally, excess deaths are about double the official COVID-19 death counts.

Excess deaths are often used to gauge mortality from an event or an epidemic. When Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017, the official death toll stood for a year at 64. But Irizarry and other scholars used a variety of techniques to calculate that excess deaths in the aftermath exceeded 1,000, perhaps by a wide margin. As a result of the statistical work, the official death toll is now 2,975.

COVID-19 will inevitably continue to kill people in the weeks ahead. Those who die over the next week or two have already been infected, perhaps several weeks ago. Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the CDC, notes that even if one could end all new infections, thousands would still die from infections already contracted.

Given the uncertainty and the lags in data, why go through this exercise of estimating deaths? Because flawed numbers based on an undercount are already a central part of the discussion, informing policy decisions, and Trump has made them so.

“We have saved thousands and thousands of lives,” he said on May 1. “Hopefully, we are going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost.” In that context, it seems worthwhile to note that this milestone has already been exceeded.

544,544,666,The Road to Reopening America Runs Through the Bathroom,"The men’s restroom at Allen Premium Outlets in Allen, Texas, on Friday. Ronald Martinez/Getty Images

In the past few months, Americans have discovered the astonishing variety of things that can happen in a parking lot. Teach a seminar? Yes. Get married? Yes. Go to church? Amen.

This may not surprise anyone who has been to a college football tailgate, which proves that only your imagination can limit what happens in the parking lot. But there is one way that we cannot turn America into one big tailgate while we wait out the pandemic: We are not going to spend the summer peeing outside.

The car is pretty good at social distancing, but don’t mistake car culture for a coronavirus cure. Even drivers have to go. The primary confined space that Americans uneasily share with strangers isn’t mass transit. It’s the public bathroom.

Bathrooms occupy a weird place in American life: They are at once an infectious chokepoint on the road to a functioning society and our only everyday infrastructure of good public health. As we reenter public spaces this summer, are we supposed to bolt bathrooms because we fear they will spread the disease, or open them so that people can wash their hands?

At the moment, any trip out in the city will remind you of the idea popularized by the urban planner Clara Greed: the bladder’s leash. The leash is pretty short, because there is nowhere to pee. Semiopen businesses have bathrooms, of course, but access is subject to even more negotiation and judgment than usual.

The bladder’s leash was already a fact of everyday life for some workers, including street vendors and New York City cab drivers, who have blamed the city’s lack of public restrooms for their parking tickets, dehydration, and incidence of diabetes. It is, like so many things about city design, worse for women.

Last week, Slate’s Mary Harris interviewed Christopher Escobar, who owns an art house movie theater in Atlanta. Escobar has cleverly appropriated his parking lot for drive-in movies and encourages moviegoers to patronize local restaurants before they arrive. As for the bathroom, he said, “We’ll encourage people to use the bathrooms before they come in.”

That’s not going to work for The Irishman, at 3½ hours, and it’s definitely not going to scale. Waffle House, which is seating patrons according to social distancing guidelines in reopened states, has single-use bathrooms. The company has “added enhanced sanitation protocols,” Waffle House director of public relations Njeri Boss told me. By this she means: Employees are supposed to clean the bathroom more frequently.

Landlords, property managers, and tenants are thinking hard about this issue. Euripides Pelekanos, the CEO of the chain Bareburger, told me to look out for three big changes in bathrooms at his restaurants when they reopen: touchless everything, frequent cleaning, and sanitizer outside the bathroom. Air-stirring hand dryers are likely to be furloughed for some time. In multistall bathrooms, every other toilet may be closed to enforce capacity restrictions (already underway in some Chinese workplaces) and maintain distance. A trade-off presents itself: An every-other-toilet system puts you farther away from other bathroom users, but also increases the ratio of users per toilet. And as malls and offices start to fill up, you risk a capacity crunch. For the fellows, the pandemic may be what finally puts partitions between every urinal.

Bathrooms are also the only place most Americans can wash their hands, which is a key step in coronavirus prevention. At the Villa Savoye, the modernist “machine for living” that Le Corbusier designed outside of Paris in 1929, a stand-alone sink in the front hall marks the forgotten architectural obsession with hygiene. These days, the only thing less sanitary than a public bathroom is not having one, which is one reason that contractors say construction sites are not, despite the open air, coronavirus-resistant workplaces.

The pandemic may be what finally puts partitions between every urinal.

On the whole, bathrooms get neither attention from architects nor investment from a nervous public. “Freud, poo-poo, you don’t have to work hard to learn where the anxiety comes from,” says the sociologist Harvey Molotch, co-editor of the 2010 volume Toilet. Fear of vagrants, drugs, sex, and crime (or some combination therein) has greatly diminished our toilet infrastructure. The New York City subway once had more than 1,600 toilets; today it has just a few dozen for more than 5 million daily riders. Poor people with long commutes, women, and older people are the ones who feel the sharpest tug of the bladder’s leash. (Young men are so willing to pee anywhere that their urine has eaten away at the foundations of the National Gallery in London and a soccer stadium in Brazil.)

More recently, the opioid crisis has prompted a new toilet panic, as bookstores, coffee shops, and other “third spaces” rush to install code-locked bathrooms to discourage heroin users. For American men, Molotch adds, bathrooms are ruled by a silence of homophobic anxiety, which robs them of the friendly banter that characterizes other bathroom experiences.

The fear of disease, in particular, has had a long influence on bathroom design and creation. London physician John Snow founded the field of public health by mapping cholera outbreaks to a well contaminated by human and animal waste. Since the 19th century, public health crises have prompted officials to build more fountains, toilets, and sinks. Frank Lloyd Wright forced us all to look at each other’s shoes in the can because shin-high stalls made it easier to clean the floor. (And, now, easier to watch for misbehavior.) White walls, tiles, and porcelain fixtures all made bathrooms brighter, and brightness was associated with cleanliness.

It’s not that the bathroom poses a more serious coronavirus risk than anything else you’re doing. (Workplace consultants believe the bottleneck on the return to downtown offices will be elevators.) But it does serve as a reminder that what we’re really talking about, when we talk about density as a factor in disease transmission, is particular spaces that a number of people have to share.

This slipperiness of the term density is what allows lazy op-ed writers to group together New York City and South Dakota meatpacking towns in the same group of coronavirus hot spots with a common character. Density is really a measure of persons in a given space. To use it in a comparison, you have to keep the denominator the same, or it starts to look like my living room is denser than Manhattan when we watch a movie.

What meatpacking plants have in common with hard-hit New York neighborhoods is people sharing confined spaces such as bathrooms. (Interestingly, of the 15 biggest U.S. metro areas, the three with the highest share of one-bathroom housing units are the coronavirus-ravaged cities of New York, Boston, and Detroit, according to the 2017 American Housing Survey.) Meatpacking plants are a reminder that even in low-density places, people come together to share space. So are churches. And in all those places, people who come together will share bathrooms. The average office worker, according to a California water use textbook, flushes the toilet between two and 3½ times a day. About half of restaurant visitors use the facilities.

Whether in Sioux Falls or in Queens, bathrooms may play a role in transmission. Elsewhere, they’ll play a role in prevention. Either way, the reopening of society only goes as far as our confidence in the spaces we share. Bathrooms are at the top of the list. That America has so few public restrooms, and the few we have are so poorly maintained (see Louis-Ferdinand Céline’s wonderful description of New York City’s “fecal grotto”) is thanks to the same starved public sector that is unable to roll out the more complex public hygiene measures that a pandemic demands. Bathrooms need to be safe, but they also need to feel safe. Otherwise, all of America is on the bladder’s leash, and the leash is short.",1

Testing positive does not mean the cats have the same illness that people have. Nor does it mean that the cats can pass on the illness to people. And tests for pets are not the same as those for people, so no humans missed out on testing because the cats were tested.
Veterinarians took samples from both cats that were tested at a private lab. The test results were then confirmed at a national veterinary lab. The owners brought both cats to veterinarians because they showed symptoms of a respiratory infection. One owner had tested positive for the virus. No human in the other cat’s household tested positive.
Other cats have tested positive for the virus, SARS-CoV-2, including a pet in Belgium and a tiger at the Bronx zoo. After the tiger who showed mild symptoms tested positive, the zoo collected fecal samples from other big cats and found that a total of five tigers and three lions had been infected. One of the tigers didn’t show any symptoms. All of the big cats are doing well, the zoo reported Wednesday.
In an experiment in China, cats were shown to be susceptible to infection with the coronavirus, showing mild symptoms. The researchers said the experiment also showed that cats could pass the virus to other cats. But that was in a laboratory setting. The virus was detected by tests done after the cats had been euthanized. The researchers noted in the paper, “It was difficult to perform regular nasal wash collection on the sub-adult cats because they were aggressive.”
The Agriculture Department and the C.D.C. emphasized that “there is no evidence that pets play a role in spreading the virus in the United States.” Other experts agree that people should not start looking at their cats with suspicion. If anything, it’s the other way around.
Karen Terio, the chief of the Zoological Pathology Program at University of Illinois’s veterinary college, where the Bronx Zoo tiger sample was tested, noted that hundreds of thousands of people have tested positive in the United States, as opposed to two cats.
Dr. Terio said that while the tests and the earlier experiments did show that cats appear to be somewhat susceptible to the virus, “If this was going to be a serious problem for cats, we would have seen greater numbers.” Either very few cats are being infected, or their symptoms are so mild that their owners don’t notice them or think they warrant a trip to the vet. The direction of infection “is not going to be cat to human,” she said. “It’s going to be us to our pets. Thankfully, they’re having very mild disease.”
For now, the C.D.C. recommends keeping cats indoors to prevent them from contact with other animals or people. And for people who become sick, they recommend, as they have in the past, isolating from pets as much as possible, treating them as you would a human being in your family.
Dogs are less susceptible to infection with the virus, according to the same research paper on cats. Although there is some evidence that they may have low-level infections, they haven’t shown any symptoms. Nonetheless, the C.D.C. recommends that you put dogs on a six-foot leash when walking them, keep them away from other animals and avoid contact as much as possible with any pets if you are sick. The American Veterinary Medical Association has the same advice, which did not change with the new announcement.
The Agriculture Department will post any confirmed tests of animals with SARS-CoV-2 on its website. It does not recommend routine testing for pets.",1
379,379,471,Apple Maps now shows COVID-19 testing sites,"Apple Maps will now show COVID-19 testing sites in all 50 states and Puerto Rico (via TechCrunch). When you search using terms like “COVID-19 test” or “coronavirus test,” places that offer COVID-19 tests will be marked on your map. If you start typing COVID-19 into the search bar, you’ll also see the “COVID-19 Testing” search term appear at the top of your search bar, like what you’d see if you started typing something like “groceries” or “coffee shops.”

Apple’s information cards for the testing sites include the site’s hours, address, and phone number, as well as a warning that “COVID-19 testing may require a doctor’s referral and an appointment at the testing center” and a link to the website of the healthcare provider offering the test.

Apple launched a portal to let healthcare providers submit their information

The new testing sites in Apple Maps follow Apple launching a web portal last week to let hospitals and healthcare providers submit their information to be shown on Apple Maps, which was spotted by 9to5Mac.

Google began listing COVID-19 test centers in search results for much of the US on April 17th, and as part of those results, you can see testing centers near you displayed on a map except if you live in Maine, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Oregon, or Pennsylvania. But it appears the search company doesn’t show nearly as many test centers when you search for them directly in Google Maps as Apple does on Apple Maps.

Apple’s app shows a number of test centers in Arizona, for example, while searching for a test center on Google Maps for the state doesn’t show a testing center there. However, if you do a Google search for COVID-19 testing in Arizona, Google will surface a map with some test centers in the state. Google tells The Verge that it’s working to bring testing center information to Google Maps in addition to search results.

Apple has also made some updates to its mobility trends site, including adding more cities such as Las Vegas, New Orleans, Portland, Salt Lake City, and San Diego.

Apple and Google have also teamed up on a coronavirus tracking system that will be built into iOS and Android.

Update April 28th, 9:08PM ET: Clarified that Google does show testing centers in maps in search results, but does not show as many centers when searching for them in Google Maps.

Correction: We stated in the latest update to this story that Google search results for COVID-19 testing in New York City surfaces testing centers in the city on a map. It does not. We regret the error. We have changed the example used in this story to Arizona to provide a more accurate comparison of data shown across Apple Maps, Google Maps, and the map surfaced in Google search results.",1
1225,1226,1587,Opinion | It’s OK to Acknowledge Good Covid-19 News,"The press has a natural affinity for catastrophes, which make compelling viewing and good copy. The pandemic is indeed a once-in-a-generation story. So the media is naturally loath to shift gears and acknowledge that the coronavirus has begun to loosen its grip.

Meanwhile, progressives and many journalists have developed a near-theological commitment to the lockdowns, such that any information that undermines them is considered unwelcome, even threatening. This accounts for the widespread sense that no one should say things have gotten better ... or people are going to die.

Usually when it is thought the public can’t handle the truth, it is a truth about some threat that could spark panic. In this case, the truth is information that might make people think it’s safe to go outside again.

Almost all the discussion about reopening is framed by worries that we will reopen too soon, not that we might reopen too late—that is literally unthinkable.

None of this is to minimize the seriousness of this pandemic. New York and its surrounding suburbs have been through hell. What’s happened in the country’s nursing homes is a tragedy. We want to be cautious about reopening—as even the most forward-leaning governors have been—and vigilant about new outbreaks.

But we have entered a new phase. As Nate Silver pointed out on Tuesday, the seven-day rolling average for deaths is 1,362, down from 1,761 the week prior and a peak of 2,070 on April 21. That’s still much too high, but the trend is favorable.

Testing capacity, such a concern for so long, has really begun to expand after hitting a plateau for weeks. Testing nationally on some days has been in the high 300,000s or (on May 17) over 400,000. The issue in some states now is not capacity but actually finding enough people to test.

Scott Gottlieb of the American Enterprise Institute notes that the positivity rate, or percentage of people testing positive, has continued to fall throughout May. In New York City, the country’s epicenter, the positivity rate was below 5 percent as of the middle of the week.

The reopenings could certainly still go awry, but so far there is no clear indication of it. Cases are still falling in Austria, Denmark and Norway, despite those countries being relatively far along on reopening. Denmark has been mystified why it is almost five weeks into reopening and hasn’t yet seen increases in infections.

On Tuesday, Georgia, so widely criticized for its reopening, had its lowest number of Covid-19 patients in the hospital since April 8, when such data began being reported. The number has dropped 12 percent since the week before, and 34 percent since May 1.

The press has often, out of sloppiness or willfulness, tried to create negative news around the reopenings. CNN tweeted last weekend, “Texas is seeing the highest number of new coronavirus cases and deaths just two weeks after it officially re-opened.” As Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics pointed out, the seven-day rolling average of new cases had indeed been trending up, but the seven-day rolling average of the number of tests had gone up, too—which would naturally turn up more cases.

The key indicator is the positivity rate, and it was down in Texas.

A North Carolina TV station tweeted, “Breaking News: NC sees largest spike in coronavirus cases since pandemic began.” That referred to 800 new cases over the past 24 hours on May 16. But tests had been going sharply up and the positivity rate trending down. Hospitalizations were basically flat.

The other day, headlines noted that Florida recorded 500 new cases on one day. It generated fewer headlines, and perhaps none, when Gov. Ron DeSantis pointed out that the state had received a dump of 75,000 test results, yielding the 500 new cases, for a minuscule positivity rate of 0.64 percent.

It’s not as though we haven’t had a cataract of unassailably legitimate bad news over the past few months. We’ve been experiencing a wrenching public health crisis and a steep recession on top of it. There shouldn’t be a need to obscure favorable trends. We can handle the truth.",1
1312,1315,1777,Coronavirus-triggered layoffs in US hit nearly 39 million – True Pundit,"The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits in the two months since the coronavirus took hold in the U.S. has swelled to nearly 39 million, the government reported Thursday, even as states from coast to coast gradually reopen their economies and let people go back to work.

More than 2.4 million people filed for unemployment last week in the latest wave of layoffs from the business shutdowns that have brought the economy to its knees, the Labor Department said.

That brings the running total to a staggering 38.6 million, a job-market collapse unprecedented in its speed.

The number of weekly applications has slowed for seven straight weeks. Yet the figures remain breathtakingly high — 10 times higher than normal before the crisis struck.

It shows that even though all states have begun reopening over the past three weeks, employment has yet to snap back and the outbreak is still damaging businesses and destroying jobs.

“While the steady decline in claims is good news, the labor market is still in terrible shape,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said over the weekend that U.S. unemployment could peak in May or June at 20% to 25%, a level last seen during the depths of the Great Depression almost 90 years ago. Unemployment in April stood at 14.7%, a figure also unmatched since the 1930s.

Over 5 million people worldwide have been confirmed infected by the virus, and about 330,000 deaths have been recorded, including about 94,000 in the U.S. and around 165,000 in Europe, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University and based on government data. Experts believe the true toll is significantly higher. – READ MORE

924,924,1098,House Democrats pass $3 trillion coronavirus relief package,"House Democrats on Friday passed a $3 trillion coronavirus relief package, unprecedented spending Senate Republicans have pledged to block as the major parties struggle to find a path forward on the pandemic response.

The chamber also approved voting by proxy and remote committee work. The rules changes, major moves for a tradition-bound institution, aim to make it easier for representatives to conduct business from outside of Washington during the crisis.

The House passed the rescue legislation in a close 208-199 vote, as Democrats saw defections from both the left and right flanks of the party. Fourteen Democrats voted against the bill and one Republican supported it.

The bill includes:

Nearly $1 trillion for cash-strapped state and local governments

A second round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals, with up to $6,000 per household

$200 billion for hazard pay for essential workers

$75 billion for Covid-19 testing efforts

An extension of the $600 per week federal unemployment insurance benefit through January (it is currently set to go through July)

$175 billion in rent, mortgage and utility assistance

A 15% increase in the maximum Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefit

Repeal of the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions for two years, which would help certain states' budget crunch but benefit higher-income taxpayers most

Expanded mail-in ballot access, which Republicans oppose

Relief funds for the U.S. Postal Service

$10 billion in emergency small business disaster assistance grants

Subsidies and a special Affordable Care Act enrollment period for people who lose employer-sponsored health coverage

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear he has no interest in taking up the proposal. On Thursday, he said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ""published an 1,800-page seasonal catalog of left-wing oddities and called it a coronavirus relief bill."" The White House threatened to veto the legislation before the House voted.

Pelosi, a California Democrat, has characterized her party's bill as an opening offer in what she hopes will become negotiations with Republicans on another round of fiscal relief. On Friday, she criticized Republicans who said they want to wait to pass more aid.

""Do you think this virus is taking a pause?"" she asked. ""Do you think that the rent takes a pause? Do you think that putting food on the table or the hunger that comes if you can't takes a pause?""

While the president opposed the Democratic plan, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany indicated this week that he would back another relief bill.

Two administration officials told CNBC that the White House would likely support another round of direct payments — a popular piece of the unprecedented emergency spending law passed in March.

McConnell has called for liability protections for doctors and businesses as part of any future legislation the Senate passes. Democrats have generally criticized such a provision.

After Democrats passed the bill Friday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer's office told members not to expect votes next week. The House is set to be in session on May 27 and 28.

The pandemic continues to ravage the country. The U.S. now has more than 1.4 million cases, and the disease has killed more than 86,000 Americans, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

More than 36 million people have filed jobless claims since the crisis started.

1386,1393,1935,"If you have a copy of Plandemic in your Google Drive, Google might try to surreptitiously delete it","(Natural News) Fake news empire The Washington Post is on a mission to make sure that every single copy of the popular Plandemic documentary film is removed from every last crevice of the internet.

The Jeff Bezos-owned, left-wing rag recently published an article in its “technology” section explaining that fake news employees of the paper are basically being paid to scour the web in search of Plandemic so they can report it to the hosting website and try to have it removed.

One perhaps unexpected place that the Post has had no trouble getting Plandemic removed from is Google Drive, a cloud-based file-sharing service that many Facebook users and YouTubers have been linking to whenever public copies of the film get censored or removed by Big Tech platforms.

Even though Google Drive accounts are supposed to be private, much like your personal hard drive, the Post has reportedly been successful in convincing Google to invade users’ files and remove Plandemic whenever they find a copy.

To those who know the Constitution, this is an obvious violation of free speech and personal privacy. But to the Post, it is a necessary response to the “weaponization” of Google Drive’s services for the purpose of “amplify[ing] dangerous content.”

Because Plandemic offers a different take on the pandemic that does not fully align with the official narrative, the Post and its Big Tech partners do not believe that you should be allowed to view it.

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, discusses how even Brighteon is now being censored by Facebook, probably because it hosts the Plandemic film without question or restriction:

The Post is now actively policing channels, pages that try to share the Plandemic film

One would think that, logically speaking, there is nothing to fear from allowing Plandemic to circulate far and wide if the content it contains is “false” and “dangerous” as the Post claims. It will eventually debunk itself, right?

Since the fix is on to force it down the memory hole, however, we can only conclude that there must be something to Plandemic that those fomenting the sham crusade against it do not want the public to learn.

Facebook and YouTube both announced back in early May that Plandemic had to go from their platforms because it makes “medically unsubstantiated” claims about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Among other things, the film questions the alleged importance of lockdowns. It also features the astute Dr. Judy Mikovitz who wrote a powerful book entitled,Â Plague of Corruption: Restoring Faith in the Promise of Science that questions vaccine safety and effectiveness, a big no-no.

What many social media users are having to do in order to still draw attention to Plandemic online is manually edit out Dr. Mikovitz’s interviews, for instance, or remove the “most problematic claims,” to quote the Post. In other words, only censored versions of the Plandemic trailer are being allowed to circulate.

Elon Musk of Tesla conducted his own witch hunt back in March against the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which is similarly being targeted by Big Tech. Musk tweeted a link to a Google Drive document citing a study about the alleged efficacy of the drug, and since that time Google has removed and blocked that document.

When asked if Google actively scans the files that users store in Google Drive, Google spokeswoman Alex Krasov refused to say, adding that her company “doesn’t go into details” about how its anti-misinformation policies are enforced.

1056,1056,1252,"Eric Trump claims coronavirus is Democratic hoax, will ‘magically’ vanish after 2020 election","“You watch, they’ll milk it every single day between now and November 3,” the younger Trump said. “And guess what, after November 3, coronavirus will magically, all of a sudden, go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen.”



He also attacked former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and boasted about crowd sizes at President Trump’s political events.



“They think they’re taking away Donald Trump’s greatest tool, which is being able to go into an arena and fill it with 50,000 people every single time,” he said.

The Biden campaign pushed back against Trump’s comments, calling them “unbelievably reckless.”

“We’re in the middle of the biggest public health emergency in a century, with almost 90,000 Americans dead, 1.5 million infected, and 36 million workers newly jobless,” Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield said in a statement. “So for Eric Trump to claim that the coronavirus is a political hoax that will ‘magically’ disappear is absolutely stunning and unbelievably reckless.”



She also accused the Trump administration of being “desperate to do whatever they can to throw up a smokescreen to try to conceal his historic mismanagement of this crisis.”



Leading health officials have repeatedly warned that the coronavirus will not go away by fall and that a surge in cases toward the end of the year could be even harder to manage than the current outbreak.

Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert, said late last month that the global spread of the disease made it “inevitable” that the coronavirus would return or linger beyond the fall. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Washington Post a second wave of covid-19 could be worse than the first because it would coincide with the flu season.



President Trump himself has acknowledged the pandemic will remain a public health problem for months. Earlier this month, he said that although he is convinced covid-19 will disappear on its own, it “doesn’t mean it’s going to be gone, frankly, by fall or after the fall.”",1
185,185,253,"Chicago sports teams, Mayor Lori Lightfoot say ‘We Are Not Playing’ to support coronavirus stay-at-home orders","All eight of Chicago’s major-league professional sports teams signed on to a new public information campaign with a motto that would’ve been unthinkable in any year but 2020: “We Are Not Playing.”

The new campaign, announced Monday by Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s office, is intended to support the stay-at-home order in place throughout Illinois and most of the rest of the United States.

“I am grateful to each of our hometown teams for stepping up and doing their part by joining in this call for every neighborhood and community,” Lightfoot said in a press conference at Soldier Field. “They’re not playing, and neither are we. The more we stay home and act responsibly, the more lives we’ll save.”

The campaign will be spread on digital and physical billboards throughout the area, then move onto online and social media channels, per a press release.

“This is a disease that doesn’t discriminate. It really doesn’t,” Lightfoot said. “And young people—I remember back in the day thinking nothing could stop me. That I was invincible. If we can get credible messengers like sports athletes who can really reach sports fans, but also young people in particular — that’s why we’re activating this group of people. We know that they have cache. We know that they have reach.”

Easily recognizable athletes from every team — including Jonathan Toews of the Blackhawks, Jason Heyward of the Cubs, Eloy Jimenez of the White Sox and Coby White of the Bulls — will participate with videos and messages encouraging Chicagoans to stay home.

“Sports has always served as a great example of achieving a common goal and overcoming the odds,” Cubs executive chairman Tom Ricketts said. “If we can all do our part to follow public health guidelines to stay at home, we can slow or stop the spread of this disease. Stay inside so that we can come together and watch baseball soon.”

Although no pro sports have taken place in the city in weeks, the motto is still jarring during a time where nearly every Chicago team would normally be either in-season or gearing up for it.

The Cubs were initially scheduled to have finished a six-game homestand Sunday and start a series in Pittsburgh on Monday. The White Sox were supposed to host the Mariners in a Monday matinee, starting their own series.

The Blackhawks would’ve just concluded their regular season Saturday against the Rangers, and the Fire would’ve hosted the Red Bulls that same day. The Bulls would be starting a pair of Staples Center road games, Monday against the Clippers and Wednesday against the Lakers, with two home games left on the schedule.

And the Sky and Red Stars would have been anticipating their season openers a few weeks away.

Lightfoot was asked about the possibility of professional football and other major sporting events resuming without fans in the stands.

“We’re not at that point yet. But, I know that the various sports leagues are talking about a variety of different options, depending on how long the public health personnel believe that we need to be reducing the size of crowds,” she said.

Instead, the entire Chicago sports scene — along with much of the rest of the city — is paused indefinitely.

Monday’s campaign announcement seeks to translate that blatantly obvious reality into day-to-day behavior changes for fans of the seven teams, emphasizing self-isolation activities that will flatten the curve over time and limit the burden on the city’s overloaded medical system.

“For every sports team in Chicago, our fans have been there for us, in both good times and bad,” White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said. “The teams receive so much support from our fans that it is our responsibility to give back whenever and however we can.”

“As far as time-outs go, none are more important to our fans than this one,” Blackhawks chairman Rocky Wirtz added. “All of us need to listen to the experts by staying off the field of play and stay at home. We owe that to ourselves, but we especially owe it the people that do not have that stay-at-home option, beginning with our front-line responders.”",1
151,151,210,Mayor Lightfoot and Gov. Pritzker announce Arts for Illinois relief initiative,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Wednesday announced a new relief program to provide financial assistance to the city’s creative scene and cultural organizations impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.

The Arts for Illinois Relief Fund, which has raised about $4 million from the public and private sector, is a partnership between the city and the state, along with the local philanthropic community.

Through the relief fund, the city’s creatives — stage and production members and part-time cultural workers — can apply for one-time grants of $1,500 distributed by 3Arts, an organization that supports artists of color, disabled artists and women artists. Grants will be awarded through a lottery system and will be disseminated quickly, according to the official announcement.

Nonprofit arts and cultural organizations of any size will be able to apply for relief through the Arts Work Fund. Based on financial need, organizations will be awarded grants from $6,000 to $30,000.

The Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) has contributed $1 million to the relief effort. Local charitable organizations such as the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Field Foundation and the Walder Foundation, have also made donations.

Fundraising efforts will be co-chaired by Illinois first lady M.K. Pritzker and Chicago first lady Amy Eshleman.

“Art has always been of incredible importance to me and to my family,” Pritzker said during his daily COVID-19 statewide press conference on Wednesday. “But of course so many of the usual ways of enjoying art together have had to be put on pause, and tragically, our creative communities have felt the financial hardship. [When] M.K., who has always put others front of mind in any hardship, told me that she had an idea to support art and artists in the fight against COVID-19, I was really excited to see what she would come up with. Honestly, she’s blown me away.”

The initiative has also launched artsforillinois.org, a website showcasing the work of Illinois creatives — artists, performers, singers, poets, painters and writers as well as dance and theater companies and museums — available for free viewing to the public.

“Artists live in relationship to their audience,” said DCASE commissioner Mark Kelly. “And for the audience to have disappeared in that visceral way of real life, it’s pretty shocking. And then on top of that, is just the economic devastation of lost jobs and lost income. In Chicago, without our music clubs, our theaters, our dance stages, without our films, poets, and painters, we’re not the great city that we live in every day.”

The financial impact of the pandemic on Illinois’ arts/creative community is staggering. According to survey by Arts Alliance Illinois, organizations closed under a statewide mandate are poised to lose more than $84 million in revenue; more than 24,124 individual events or performances have been canceled or postponed. A total of 3,563 full-time and 13,144 part-time/contract jobs have been impacted.

“This fund is so deeply appreciated,” said Amanda Williams, a Chicago-based visual artist who also spoke at Pritzker’s press conference on Wednesday. “To my fellow artists, I speak to you now. My hope is that this emergency fund can help you keep your lights on, or bridge you until the next cell phone bill is due, or to put food on your table. This is a crisis, and we understand the severity, but our hope is that this provides some light; some beacon of hope.”

400,400,496,Uptown hospital successfully treats coronavirus patient with blood plasma from someone who recovered from the sickness,"An Uptown hospital is among the first Chicago-area facilities to successfully treat a coronavirus patient using an investigational therapy involving plasma taken from someone who has recovered from the virus.

The patient was a Chicago man in his 40s who arrived at Weiss Memorial Hospital in “moderate to severe” condition and had not responded to other treatments, said Dr. Suzanne Pham, the hospital’s associate medical director. The patient, who had few other health issues, was close to having to be ventilated, Pham said.

“Within 24 hours of plasma infusion, [he] was able to be weaned down on his oxygen needs and was able to be discharged from the hospital within three days of that plasma infusion,” Pham said Wednesday. “So he recovered very quickly and nicely.”

The patient was discharged in mid-April, she said.

Pham said the recovery was a point of pride for a small community hospital, which has about 120 beds. On Wednesday, the hospital had about 70 coronavirus-positive patients and another 20 awaiting test results, Pham said.

Related Gilead drug proves effective against coronavirus in US study

The hospital was able to offer the treatment through a program led by the Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic, with the donor blood coming from the American Red Cross, Pham said. The treatment involves coronavirus patients being injected with a one-time dose of 200 milliliters of plasma.

“That plasma does have evidence of antibodies that potentially can attack the virus and hence, once transfused into a patient suffering from acute stages of illness, can help that patient recover more rapidly,” Pham said.

Three other Weiss coronavirus patients have been given the treatment, but Pham said it’s too early to say if the therapy will result in “significant benefits.”

“While convalescent plasma use remains investigational, we are cautiously optimistic that it will continue to show promise as a treatment option for our COVID-19 patients,” Pham said.

Several major local hospitals — including Rush University Medical Center and UChicago Medicine — are enrolled in trials involving the use of plasma treatment for the coronavirus. Spokespeople for each institution said Wednesday it’s too early to talk about possible success rates.

A spokeswoman for Northwestern Memorial Hospital said the hospital is also involved in a national study, but is still awaiting the availability of plasma before beginning treatment.",1
100,100,147,Shortage of Virus Tests in U.K. Lures Profiteers and Con Artists,"
LONDON — Within hours of the British government announcing that its National Health Service could no longer dedicate the resources to test every suspected case of coronavirus, a doctor at a private clinic in London began procuring supplies of screening kits that he has since been selling for three times what they cost.
“I know that a lot of people are slagging me off for racketeering,” said the doctor, Mark Ali, using a British term to refer to the insults he had received. Within a week, he had taken in 2.6 million pounds in orders, about $3 million.
“On the contrary,” he said in defense of his activities. “I met a national need at the point when the government was doing little.”
Widespread testing for the coronavirus has since emerged as a central pillar of the British government’s strategy to combat the outbreak. But private clinics, labs and go-between distributors have jumped at the opportunity to trade in testing services, snapping up supplies of diagnostic kits that the government badly needs.
[Update: Boris Johnson, U.K. Prime Minister, has the coronavirus.]Adding to the concerns, some of the kits have been sold at a steep markup, bringing accusations of profiteering. Many are also unreliable, producing false negatives and false positives. Some are outright fakes.
Britain, like the United States, changed tactics after its leaders came under fierce criticism for initially failing to test widely enough. It now aims to test 25,000 hospital patients a day, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that the government would buy “millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer.”
Public health officials have said that they are in discussions with nearly two dozen private firms about coronavirus testing systems and that they had signed a deal worth about $1.2 million with one laboratory to provide the kits.
While there is little doubt that the government will reach its goal, experts say the authorities should not have to compete with private companies for testing kits or for other important items at this crucial moment.
“A scarce, vital resource like testing must be thought of as a public resource, no matter whether it’s produced and provided by the government or the private sector,” said Dr. Jonathan Quick of the Duke Global Health Institute in the United States, who is a former director of medicine policy at the World Health Organization. “Not to do so further endangers everyone,” he added.
That has not stopped some companies from trying to cash in, which is not strictly speaking illegal but can carry a stigma.
Consider AlphaBioLabs, a small private service in northwestern England that was, until now, probably best known for carrying out DNA tests on “The Jeremy Kyle Show,” a tabloid-style daytime TV program in Britain that was canceled last year.
In a statement published on March 20, the lab said it had been “shocked and saddened to receive so many desperate inquiries from front-line organizations, such as the N.H.S., needing the Covid-19 screening test.” The company pledged to sell its “initial stock” to the National Health Service at cost, but did not say how many testing kits that included.
Three days earlier, AlphaBioLabs — which has since stopped marketing the test to the public — had announced that it would be selling its kit for £125. One newspaper hailed the news with the headline: “Brit lab’s new finger-prick test can ‘detect virus in 15 minutes.’”
But the British lab did not create the test. The one advertised on its website was made by an American company, BioMedomics. Each kit costs around $2 to manufacture and no more than $9 to buy wholesale.
David Thomas, managing director of AlphaBioLabs, said that the cost of the test was only one expense in their marketing. The company also pays for a demonstration by a medical worker and online tutorials for businesses with larger orders. He also pointed to rising component costs, and packaging and logistical expenses.
Mr. Thomas declined to answer questions about how much profit the company made per test or how many it had sold, but he said that the profit margin was “very modest and in line with industry norms.”
BioMedomics confirmed that the British lab had placed an order for coronavirus tests — a minimum order is 1,000 kits — but would not provide any further details. “As a small company,” said a spokesman, Kent Lupino, “while we try to vet resellers as best we can, we do not have control over all those who would use this pandemic as an opportunity to blatantly profiteer from those in need.”
AlphaBioLabs said it was hoping to clear its backlog of orders and had enlisted manufacturers with offices in China, Germany and the United States, but refused to name them. Going forward, Mr. Thomas said, the lab would sell the tests only to the N.H.S., emergency services and to businesses classified by the government as “critical infrastructure companies.”
“AlphaBioLabs is absolutely not profiteering from this global health pandemic, but providing a vital service which is in great demand,” he added.
Annelise Wilder-Smith, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that governments should set a cap on the price and number of tests available through the private sector.
“While I am all for liberal and extensive testing, and am not against the private sector offering testing,” she said, “the government needs to clamp down on any exploitation during a time of crisis.”

Dr. Ali, who runs the Private Harley Street Clinic in London, said he was unrepentant about his trading, after taking orders for nearly 7,000 tests at £375 each. He said he had donated 100 tests to the N.H.S.
“I’m entirely comfortable with the price, and if somebody else wants to offer it for less, that’s fine,” he said in an interview. “I believe the people should be tested, so I’m going to offer it.”
What Dr. Ali is offering for that £375 takes some explanation.The Private Harley Street Clinic does not manufacture the coronavirus test kits, nor does it distribute them or process any test results. Yet it has sold the testing kits for more than three times the £120 that the manufacturer, Randox Laboratories in Northern Ireland, charges the public directly.
Once ordered on the Private Harley Street Clinic website, the tests are shipped from Randox directly to customers without ever passing through the clinic. Dr. Ali declined to say what he paid for the kits and claimed not to know what profit he had made, but he said that his price included clinical advice.
Private Harley Street Clinic’s main asset appears to be the marketing value its name brings through an association with the renowned medical street in London — despite company records showing that the “clinic” is actually based at Dr. Ali’s apartment, miles away in North London.
The firm was incorporated in 2017 shortly after Dr. Ali’s two previous companies, which had almost identical names, were struck off the government’s register of companies for failing to provide required financial data. Private Harley Street Clinic was also threatened with being struck off until it posted financial accounts last summer, which showed that it had total net assets of less than £200.
Dr. Ali said that his clinic had delivered orders for tests worth £1 million so far and that he had been so overwhelmed with requests that he had been forced to hire temporary employees to take calls. The doctor said he planned to hire more staff members this week to help cope with the surge.
“I basically had to create a war cabinet,” he said. “We’re responding to a national emergency.”But despite the extra staffing, and assurances on his website that customers would receive their test returns within three days, the first results were expected to start arriving on Tuesday, more than a week after the service was introduced.
Dr. Ali said that he knew it would be “absolute pandemonium,” but he said that he had been left short after Randox failed to deliver the thousand tests a day that he had been promised andthat his customers had already paid for.
Randox is one of the private labs in discussions with public health officials in Britain about providing tests, but it has already been overwhelmed with demand from the private sector. If the lab did sign a deal with the N.H.S., Dr. Ali said, he would stop selling the kits privately.
Amy Millar, a spokeswoman for Randox, confirmed that the company was “in discussions with various health bodies, including Public Health England, on how to utilize the test to help” in the coronavirus response. The company added that it had developed the test for a “very competitive price” but had “no control” over what retailers charged or what customers were prepared to pay.
Neither of the tests developed by Randox or BioMedomics have been approved by the British or American authorities, though both are accredited labs and have European health and safety certification.
Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for Britain, said last week that the government was in talks with several companies about antibody tests but warned that officials were still not sure that the kits “currently on the market are the right ones.”
The official advice is for people to avoid rapid, at-home coronavirus tests because there was “little evidence to the accuracy of their tests.” Indeed, AlphaBioLabs acknowledged that “screening testing devices are known and accepted by scientists to not be as accurate as laboratory confirmatory testing.”
Professor Wilder-Smith of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that that was why the government needed to take control of testing, to determine “who sells tests where, at what price and at what standard.”
“Both a false positive and a false negative test will have negative consequences,” she noted.Other kits, however, are just fraudulent.
Last week, the European Anti-Fraud Office began an inquiry into fake coronavirus products, including counterfeit test kits, masks, medical devices and sanitizers, that were being sold around the world for “potentially huge illicit profits.”
A few days after the investigation was opened, a 59-year-old man, Frank Ludlow, appeared in court in Brighton, southern England, accused of making fake kits that he had touted as a treatment for the novel coronavirus but that actually contained potentially harmful chemicals.
He was arrested after the law enforcement authorities in Los Angeles intercepted a package containing 60 of the fake kits.",1

Updated at 9:20 p.m. ET

A Chinese doctor who was among the first to blow the whistle on the new coronavirus has died from the disease, the hospital treating him said on social media early Friday local time.

Li Wenliang, 34, an ophthalmologist based in Wuhan, was reprimanded in early January by local police authorities for ""publishing falsehoods"" after he mentioned in a WeChat group seven cases of a virus similar to SARS from a seafood market.

News of Li's death has triggered millions of reactions on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. Most posts mourned him, called him a hero and commented with candle emojis, some with mourning poems. When Li was in critical condition late Thursday and early Friday local time, millions of people flocked to a livestream operated by local media outside the hospital, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Among the outpouring of grief, some asked for accountability and transparency surrounding his treatment and the larger picture of authorities' response to the virus.

The topics ""Wuhan government owes Dr. Li Wenliang an apology"" and ""We want freedom of speech"" soon began to trend on Weibo, before being deleted, CNN reported.

In a now-deleted interview with Beijing Youth Daily in late January, Li said that the report on SARS is not entirely accurate, although he didn't mean to be misleading. He also didn't mean to spread the information widely.

But he was trying to warn his old classmates, many of whom were practicing clinicians. He said he was later infected after treating a female patient with ""unknown pneumonia.""

On his personal Weibo account one week before he died, Li recounted his journey from seeing the coronavirus test result, to being reprimanded by the authorities for disrupting the social order, to being hospitalized.

""I was hospitalized on the 12th. At that time, I was still wondering, 'Why is there no announcement of people-to-people transmission, and why are no medical workers getting infected?'"" he wrote.

He was diagnosed with coronavirus the next day. ""The dust is settled now.""

Li's death has prompted condolences from state media, including the People's Daily and the Global Times.

Michael Ryan, head of the World Health Organization's emergencies program said, ""We're very sad to hear of the loss of Dr. Li Wenliang. We're very sorry to hear of the loss of any front line worker who's attempted to care for patients. And we ourselves have lost our friends in the front lines. So we should celebrate his life and mourn his death with his colleagues.""

Bank of America has priced a $1 billion corporate bond issue to help fight the coronavirus pandemic.

According to Bloomberg data, it is the first sale from a US financial institution that earmarks all funds raised to mitigating the pandemic.

The bank sold fixed-to-floating rate notes to finance investments that aim to rectify social issues related to coronavirus, a confidential source who was not authorized to speak on the matter told Bloomberg.

The source said the bonds will generate a yield 1.30 percentage points higher than US Treasurys.

683,683,828,"Forget 24/7, it’s now 24/30 — or longer — for some who take care of developmentally disabled: ‘Basically, we are their family’","Roosevelt Journigans hasn’t left his workplace in 30 days, and he just signed up to extend that streak to 45 days before he finally goes home again.

Journigans is among 120 employees of Trinity Services Inc. who during the COVID-19 pandemic have moved into residential facilities for developmentally disabled individuals in Illinois to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease.

Instead of eight or nine different staff members a day coming and going across three eight-hour shifts at the Joliet care home where he works, Journigans and two other women left their own homes behind to live 24/7 at the facility for a month.

Opinion

“At first I wasn’t interested,” said Journigans, 63, who normally lives with his sister in Lockport. “It worked out pretty good.”

It’s quite a personal sacrifice, albeit one that comes with additional compensation of overtime pay and bonuses.

The sacrifice also is made easier by the special relationships that often exist between residents and workers.

“You develop bonds with them. I always worry about them. Basically, we are their family,” he said.

The so-called “stay in place” approach requires workers to cut themselves off physically from the community, almost as if they were working on an oil well at sea.

The idea is that the coronavirus cases plaguing nursing homes and other group living arrangements usually are brought into those settings by asymptomatic staff members who do not realize they are carrying the virus.

By reducing the number of people going in and out of a building, officials at Trinity hoped to limit the potential exposure to residents.

It appears to have worked. Only six individuals have tested positive for COVID-19 with just one death across Trinity’s 100 facilities housing 650 clients.

Nobody has become sick at the Joliet intermediate care facility where Journigans has spent the past month caring for its 14 residents.

Fifty-one of Trinity’s 100 homes, including all eight in Chicago, are using the stay-in-place staffing system.

Other Illinois service providers to the developmentally disabled have adopted similar approaches after learning about Trinity’s efforts, said Thane Dykstra, chief executive officer of the non-profit organization.

Dykstra said staying in place has worked well for residents but has been difficult for employees.

“I think people are glad when they come out. It’s a lot of work,” he said.

In addition, some struggled with missing family events such as Easter and Mother’s Day. Another couldn’t be there when a family member died.

“It’s been challenging for folks, but a lot of them understand the value and the difference they’ve made for our program participants,” Dykstra said.

Journigans and his co-workers are known as “direct support professionals” or DSPs, a notoriously low-paid line of work involving some of society’s most dedicated caregivers.

As I have written previously, caregivers in these settings don’t have the luxury of social distancing. In many cases, they have to help residents eat, bathe and dress. They also have to prepare the food and clean.

Starting pay is $10.10 an hour. The state reimburses providers such as Trinity at $13 an hour. The low pay rate is a constant problem because it makes it difficult to recruit and retain workers.

“We’ve lost so many fabulous workers, and the only reason they left was because of money,” said Journigans, who is president of his AFSCME local union.

Since shutting himself in at the Joliet facilty, Journigans said he’s worked 16 to 17 hours a day on average, which means he’s piling up 80 to 90 hours of overtime per week — at time and a half. Employees are not paid for the time they are sleeping. He’ll receive a $2,000 bonus for completing the 30 days — and another $2,000 when he finishes the additional 15 days.

Dykstra said Trinity is able to temporarily afford the bonuses because the state is continuing to pay for the day program the agency normally provides but can’t during the shutdown. Given the staff shortages, overtime costs are always present, he said.

Residents of the Joliet home have been diagnosed with Down syndrome, autism and other developmental disabilities. They range in age from 29 to 65.

All are mobile, although some are in wheelchairs. Not everyone speaks, but “most understand what you’re saying,” Journigans said.

Journigans came to this line of work as a young man after being laid off from a factory job and found that it changed him for the better, teaching both patience and empathy.

He takes his sense of accomplishment in the small things, such as teaching a 60-year-old man how to tie his own shoes for the first time.

When this pandemic is behind us, it would be shameful if we failed to better compensate those who make this commitment.",1
1237,1238,1604,"Coronavirus: Best US cities for a staycation, according to WalletHub","The decision for many businesses during the coronavirus pandemic is to pivot or perish.

Some business shifts seem like natural moves — restaurants offering takeout, venues livestreaming concerts or retailers scaling up online sales.

Businesses that are based around gathering people together for a tour, a game, travel or a conference are finding new ways to get money coming in the door.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours can't load up buses of strangers to take them on a tour of Milwaukee these days. Stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements make it nearly impossible. Even with the easing of restrictions, it's unknown when the general public will feel comfortable gathering again.

The company started receiving phone calls for cancellations as soon as President Donald Trump declared a national emergency. By the next day, more than $200,000 in business was canceled or refunded, said company owner Theresa Nemetz.

""Within 48 hours, I realized we were completely out of business unless we pivot,"" Nemetz said.

Can these stores survive?:Can these 13 retailers outlast coronavirus?

Lost Penney? J.C. Penney says it plans to close nearly 29% of stores – or 242 locations – as part of its bankruptcy

Coming up with a new line of business was the only way Nemetz could keep paying her five-person full-time staff and continue to call part-time workers.

The idea was to bring the sights and tastes of Milwaukee to customers' doors with care packages. Instead of taking people through the city for sausages at Usinger's and pretzels from Milwaukee Pretzel Co., Milwaukee Food & City Tours is packing those items up (along with virtual tour experience access) and shipping it out.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours started in late March with quarantine care kits and shelter-in-style kits.

Nearly 2,000 care packages have been sold. The move is sustaining Nemetz's business. She has not had to furlough staff members. She also received federals funds through the Paycheck Protection Program.

The selection has expanded with specialty care packages for events like birthdays, Mother's Day and Cinco De Mayo. The kits vary in price from around $35 for a chocolate self-care kit to $78 for the ultimate snack break.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours is thinking about offering tours again to private groups with guides leaving adequate distance and talking through headsets. But it's also thinking about how these care packages can become a lasting part of the business.

""For the next couple of years, it's possible that some individuals won't be able to do a tour,"" she said. Instead of having travelers visit Milwaukee to learn about the city, she'll ship the experience to them.

Marla Poytinger isn't sure when her company will be able to bring 1,500 people through her bars for ax throwing, mini-golf, shuffleboard and painting again on a Saturday night.

The live, host-led trivia game her company launched during the pandemic will remain part of Bars & Recreation Inc.'s business line after bars open.

""Even if the world goes back to normal, which I don’t think anyone expects, there is still a huge market of people who ... still need to gather and interact but can’t or aren't willing to come together physically,"" Poytinger said. Public games are $9 per registration, which can include all the people quarantined together.

The company, which runs Axe MKE, Splash Studio, NorthSouth Club and Nine Below, is seeing maybe just 1% of its normal revenue, she said.

Many businesses like hers would lose all their revenue unless a new product could be sold.

Daniel Cruz was launching his new laundry service for Airbnb hosts, Washbnb, as the pandemic halted travel. The company faced a total loss. Cruz thought about shutting down, but laundry still needs to get done, even during a pandemic.

Washbnb shifted gears to offering services to people who are elderly or immunocompromised in the Milwaukee community, charging around $10 to $20 a load with delivery. The company is also offering a pay-what-you-can model. It is operating at a loss and actively looking for investors to raise $450,000.

Nearly all the trade shows that BoothCentral Inc. works with to manage vendors are canceled for the foreseeable future.

""No events are collecting vendor payment,"" said BoothCentral co-founder Tim Gill. ""We had to pivot or we would be at a standstill.""

BoothCentral's development team built a new platform out in 10 days to replicate the experience of an in-person trade show. This is not just a live stream. The virtual event page contains a main livestream and vendor rooms, among other areas, with the goal to replicate the buzz of an in-person event.

It held its first virtual event in the middle of April.

""We didn't go into this thinking it would be extended this long,"" he said. ""But we just knew that we had to do something.""

On its new platform, BoothCentral is hosting art fairs, home and garden shows, and career fairs. The company is now growing and hiring to add to its staff of 10 employees. Even once in-person events are held again, BoothCentral anticipates hybrid models with online components.

243,243,318,4/20 plans nixed as celebrations of legal weed move online amid coronavirus outbreak,"April 20 has long been a celebration of all things weed, but this year was supposed to be different in Illinois.

Coming just over three months after pot was legalized for recreational use, 4/20 offered an opportunity for the state’s residents to publicly embrace cannabis and its colorful subculture, which has swiftly shifted from the underground to Main Street.

But as the number of COVID-19 cases continued to rise late last month, Gov. J.B. Pritzker effectively put the kibosh on any 4/20 parties when he extended a statewide stay-at-home order until May that prohibits large gatherings.

Dispensary 33 has since announced that the third annual Waldo’s Forever Fest, a huge, bud-friendly bash slated to take place Saturday outside the pot shop at Clark and Division, will now be held online using the Twitch app. The physical event has tentatively been rescheduled for Sept. 26.

“This 4/20 was going to be on a whole ‘nother level. We were super excited to blow it out with the street festival. I think we were going to have twice the size of out footprint last year,” Dispensary 33 spokeswoman Abigail Watkins said of the event, which drew thousands last year.

Consumption allowed — at home

Watkins said the socially distanced shindig, scheduled to start at 4:20 p.m. on Saturday, looks to “showcase different personalities and different people’s talents in the cannabis community all throughout Chicago.” The bill features a live-stream of local DJs and glass blowers, as well as stony Chicago sibling rockers White Mystery and drag performers Lucy Stoole and Shea Coulee, a finalist on “RuPaul’s Drag Race.”

“I still think it’ll be fun and we’ll still be able to connect people through cannabis and celebrate,” said Watkins. “Also people are going to be able to smoke at home and actually celebrate 4/20 with consumption, which there wasn’t going to be consumption on-site at the fest” — since public consumption remains illegal.

With much of the country ordered to stay home, similar virtual events offer pot users a way to observe the “high” holiday from their living rooms. One celebration scheduled for Monday and dubbed Higher Together features a DJ set and smoke session with rapper and reefer enthusiast Wiz Khalifa and a performance by Billy Ray Cyrus.

All proceeds from a donation drive will go to the Last Prisoner Project, a nonprofit that seeks to address the harms of cannabis prohibition and is circulating a petition to urge President Donald Trump and the Federal Bureau of Prisons “to take the necessary steps to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus on our incarcerated communities.”

2nd pot event moves online

Meanwhile, Monday’s second annual Chicago Cannabis Health and Wellness Fair at Olive-Harvey College is also moving online.

Organized by the Chicago Cannabis Health Initiative, the event boasts pot-centric panels, demonstrations and presentations on a range of topics, including weed-infused cooking, cannabis rights and using the drug to deal with pain and post-traumatic stress disorder. Donte Townsend, founder of the Chicago chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, an advocacy group co-sponsoring the event, will give a virtual talk on CBD & hemp, a plant he’s been cultivating at a huge growth facility in Putnam County.

Though Townsend said it’s “a little heartbreaking” that plans had to be changed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, he tried to look on the bright side.

“With what’s going on, we’ve found ways to be able to still offer a free service to the public about health and the beneficial uses of cannabis in its multiple forms that people can access from home,” he said.",1
58,58,97,Coronavirus Forces Bureau To Suspend Census Field Operations Until April 1,"Coronavirus Forces Bureau To Suspend Census Field Operations Until April 1

Enlarge this image toggle caption Amr Alfiky/NPR Amr Alfiky/NPR

Updated March 19 at 9:25 a.m. ET

The coronavirus pandemic is forcing the U.S. Census Bureau to temporarily suspend all field operations for the 2020 census for two weeks until April 1, the agency announced Wednesday in a statement on its website.

As the country continues to bunker down in response to the spread of COVID-19, the bureau's director, Steven Dillingham, says it is making the change ""to help protect the health and safety of the American public, Census Bureau employees, and everyone going through the hiring process for temporary census taker positions.""

For the next couple of weeks, the bureau is also reducing the number of on-site workers at two facilities in Jeffersonville, Ind., that process paper census forms, the bureau says in a separate statement on its website.

Another facility in Phoenix that also processes paper forms is ""adopting social distancing practices in line with guidance from health authorities,"" Michael Cook, a spokesperson for the bureau, told NPR in a statement on Thursday.

Many census advocates are worried that the ongoing public health crisis could jeopardize the bureau's ability to accurately count the U.S. population this year as required by the Constitution.

All U.S. households, however, can continue to respond to the census on their own either online at my2020census.gov, over the phone or by paper form, if they receive one. Official letters with instructions on how to participate in the national head count are expected to arrive at most homes by Friday.

The announcement comes days after the bureau confirmed to NPR on Saturday that it is delaying deploying door knockers to college towns until April 23 and waiting until early April to start sending out census workers with computer tablets to help people complete online forms.

Still, there has been a lot of uncertainty about how the bureau plans to protect early rounds of census workers expected to go door to door to count residents in remote parts of Alaska and Maine, and in some American Indian tribal territories. Other workers were set to leave paper questionnaires in Puerto Rico and other places recovering from natural disasters. The bureau had also been preparing to conduct an in-person count of people experiencing homelessness.

Recently hired enumerators, also known as door knockers, and other field staff have been gathering around the country for training sessions. The bureau confirmed to NPR on Saturday that at least one employee, who was hired to be a census field supervisor, has tested positive for COVID-19 and is in quarantine.

""The employee is following guidance of the Iowa Department of Public Health,"" Michael Cook, a spokesperson for the bureau, said in a follow-up email on Sunday.

While that employee has not interacted with the public on behalf of the bureau, the census field supervisor was in contact with a ""very limited number of employees"" at a training session, and all of them are in self-quarantine, Cook said on Saturday.

The latest state population counts are due to the president by December 31, according to federal law.

The numbers of every person living in the U.S. determine each state's share of congressional seats and Electoral College votes for the next decade. They also guide how as much as $1.5 trillion a year in federal funding for Medicare, Medicaid and other public services are divided up among local communities.

In the written statement, Dillingham said that as of Wednesday morning, more than 11 million households have submitted a census response on their own through the Internet since March 9, when the online form at my2020census.gov was soft launched.

Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who helps oversee the 2020 census as the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, says she hopes more households will continue to find ways to respond to the census during the temporary pause in field operations.

""Every American should know that this does not affect your ability to self-respond,"" Maloney said in a statement. ""By responding now, you will ensure that the Census Bureau does not need to send a census worker to your door.""",1

Tenants of a dormitory on 11 Cheredovaya Street in the city of Omsk were locked in the building. All the tenants of the building are not allowed to go outside. Earlier, several cases of the coronavirus infection were registered among those living in the dormitory, and all 500 tenants found themselves under the conditions of strict quarantine.

Police officers were put on guard at the entrances – the citizens supposedly do not follow the rules of the self-isolation mode. However, the officers have not been able to show the decree on quarantine restrictions to the tenants because they do not have the document themselves.

All the tenants of the dormitory are thus prohibited from going outside: the people are not allowed to go out to buy groceries, medications or other essential drugs. Most of them survive with the help of their relatives and friends, who bring them food.

Those who do not have anyone to help them, were forced to go from door to door asking for bread.

Someone reportedly tried to go out to buy groceries through the back door, but the door was soon blocked. Someone else, as it was reported, jumped out of the window on the second storey to be able to go to buy groceries.

336,336,425,Go read this story on how COVID-19 took over cruise ships,"Many industries have been negatively impacted by the novel coronavirus, including the cruise industry, with cruise ships deemed some of the most dangerous places due to the limited airflow and confined spaces. With no global organization or agency keeping track of cases from cruise ships, the Miami Herald, a Florida-based newspaper, decided to track outbreaks on oceangoing cruise ships.

As of April 23rd, the Miami Herald found at least 3,582 people during or directly after a cruise have tested positive for COVID-19, with “at least 65 people” dead as a result. The COVID-19 cases they found were linked to at least 54 oceangoing cruise ships — roughly one-fifth of the global ocean cruise fleet. However, that number could still grow, with the outlet pledging to continue tracking and providing weekly updates until the pandemic ends.

Some of the infected passengers were sent straight from the cruise ships to hospitals, but many returned to their homes — some of them traveling back home through commercial flights, potentially spreading the virus even further. Adding to the issue was the fact that many crew members were unable to leave their ships due to the virus; at one point, 15 cruise ships were rotating around PortMiami, leaving them as “sitting ducks for outbreaks,” Miami Herald reports.

Miami Herald reporters collected data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, foreign health departments, news reports, as well as interviews from passengers and crew aboard those ships. The outlet reached out to four of the world’s most significant cruise lines, though only Carnival and MSC Cruises provided data.

121,121,172,The coronavirus pandemic is no excuse to crack down on immigration,"Editor’s note, April 21st, 2020: Donald Trump tweeted on April 20th that he would sign an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration to the US in response to the pandemic. It’s not yet clear how this would work or who would be affected if Trump follows through. But it’s an alarming threat given the president’s broad powers to regulate immigration and his previous moves to push through hard-line policies during the COVID-19 crisis. This piece was published before that tweet, but its points about the futility of using immigration policy to fight a virus are more relevant than ever.

To get myself through the pandemic, I’ve been summoning everything I’ve learned about surviving in a new world as an immigrant. I left the Philippines as a kid to join my parents in California. “Walang tiyaga, walang nilaga,” my grandma used to say. Strictly translated, it means “no perseverance, no stew.” That lesson on weathering hardship recently took on new meaning.

I’m not just worried about the virus. Reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans are up, while President Trump continues to characterize the disease as “foreign” and “Chinese.” Some of my friends are worried about heading outside not only because of the virus, but because of the racist slurs hurled at them.

Filipinos, like other immigrant groups, tend to be overrepresented in jobs on the frontlines of the pandemic. The Philippines sends more nurses abroad to staff the world’s health care systems than any other country in the world. Filipinos also make up a third of all cruise ship workers and, in China, are the largest group of migrant domestic workers. The service industry that delivers food to our doorsteps relies on immigrants, too.

immigrants are overrepresented in jobs on the frontlines of the pandemic

Many of the neighborhoods where people of color and immigrants live have more air pollution, which can be deadly during outbreaks of a virus that affects the lungs. For instance, Latinos are over 51 percent more likely to live in counties with dangerous levels of smog than non-Hispanic whites. That can lead to chronic conditions such as asthma that make someone especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Pollution has also been linked to heart disease; people with serious heart conditions are also at higher risk of getting seriously sick from COVID-19.

There’s more. Some immigrants are afraid to seek care because they are worried that they will endanger their own immigration status by doing so. Under a new rule, a person who uses public benefits like Medicaid can be denied a green card. This doesn’t apply to permanent residents renewing their green cards, but misinformation is already stopping people from getting care. After pushback from Democrats, US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it wouldn’t penalize green card applicants for getting treatment or testing for COVID-19. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced on March 18th that it won’t “carry out enforcement operations at or near” health care facilities; advocates and doctors worried that the fear of getting swept up by ICE might keep people from getting care. But that might not matter if people are too afraid to see a doctor.

With any disaster, some people are hit first and worst. There are parallels between the COVID-19 pandemic and environmental injustice, says Mustafa Santiago Ali, who led the Environmental Protection Agency’s efforts to address environmental racism and injustice under the Obama administration. In both crises, the people facing the greatest risk are often people of color, working class families, and the poor. “More of our folks are going to die disproportionately,” he says, meaning black, brown, and indigenous communities. The people calling the shots don’t come from the places that are most affected — so they often don’t understand what’s happening on the ground. They might even make decisions that make things worse.

“More of our folks are going to die disproportionately.”

Now, the Trump administration is using the pandemic as an excuse to push hard-line immigration policies it would have pursued anyway, says Sarah Pierce, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “[They’re] really taking advantage of this moment, even though it’s a questionable decision to pour resources into that,” she says. “Maybe we should be concentrating more on finding masks for doctors and nurses than we should be on kicking asylum seekers out of the country.”

Pierce thinks more people will lose their work authorization or violate their visas because US Citizenship and Immigration Services has shut down its offices and suspended in-person meetings that immigrants must attend to keep their legal status. That means more people could face deportation or detention in facilities that, like prisons, can become hotbeds for disease. While immigrant rights advocates are calling for detention centers to shut down, the Trump administration is using them to fearmonger.

People in detention could pass the virus on to customs and border patrol officers, and “even the United States population as a whole,” US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said in a March 20th briefing on the pandemic. “Migrants in [detention] facilities are drawing on an American healthcare system that is already fighting the coronavirus pandemic,” he added. That day, the administration announced it would begin to remove anyone crossing US borders illegally, including people seeking asylum, immediately without due process.

I’ve heard this crap my whole life: that immigrants take more than we give — whether that’s overburdening health care, snatching jobs, or whatever — so let’s send them away. Racism and xenophobia has always threatened my existence in this country.

That “us versus them” flavor of fearmongering is common in epidemics

That “us versus them” flavor of fearmongering is common in epidemics. Italian immigrants were scapegoats for the New York City polio epidemics in 1907 and 1916. Cholera was called “Asiatic cholera” in the 1800s and tuberculosis called the “Jewish disease” in the 1900s. Thousands of people died from AIDS before the Reagan administration began taking the epidemic seriously in the mid-1980s, after making callous jokes about the disease referred to as “gay plague.”

“With this new virus, something was triggered that is always latently there, under the surface, which is this fear of the other and the idea that bad things come from elsewhere,” York University professor Roger Keil told The Verge in February.

The virus is already spreading in the US; it’s useless to scapegoat migrants at our borders when we now have more cases of COVID-19 than any other country in the world. The Latin American country with the most cases of COVID-19 is Brazil, which had 2,433 cases on the 26th — just over one-tenth of the number of infections in New York City alone. It seems likelier that migrants in detention centers will get sick here. And deporting people who were infected in the US back to other countries means spreading the disease further.

Shifting blame onto others does nothing to keep Americans, including myself, safe. It’s a waste of energy when every moment matters in our response to the crisis. I’ve watched New York City’s local officials plead daily for ventilators and federal assistance. As someone who calls this place home, this is terrifying. My mom and many of my aunties are nurses in the US; they need more masks and medical supplies to keep people healthy.

Division only makes dealing with disaster harder

Division only makes dealing with disaster harder, both Ali and Pierce told me. Another lesson I’ve learned from my community is that the only way we beat the odds is when we show up for each other. My aunt, uncles, cousins, and grandmothers stepped in to take care of me in the Philippines until my parents were on solid footing and could send for me. Together, they got me here to where I am today. The only way to get through this crisis will be to do so together, too. My mom and aunties will take care of you when you get sick. Make sure to take care of them, too. They’re immigrants, and we’ll need them.",1
45,45,79,100 things to do while stuck inside due to a pandemic,"USA TODAY Life staff

1110,1110,1344,American Colleges Are Headed for a Meltdown,"They've been through riots, protests, and natural disasters—but America's colleges have never seen anything like the financial meltdown the coronavirus is about to bring to their campuses.

The rising wave of health fears, added costs, and vanishing tuition payments could crush small colleges, many of which were already hanging by a financial thread. Those that can weather the crisis—including big-name universities with billions in their bank accounts—in turn stand to gain big from the fallout.

The emptying out of schools and the mass transition to distance learning has already been ""the largest all-sector hit that we've ever seen,"" Jim Hundrieser, a vice president with the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO), told the Washington Free Beacon. But the challenges of this spring pale in comparison to the shock many colleges are expecting in the fall, when social distancing measures and a possible second wave could create the most surreal semester ever.

That strangeness, experts project, could in turn cause a massive drop in college revenue. Well-endowed colleges and big research schools have the savings to weather those effects. But many schools are beholden to semi-annual tuition payments, which are about to undergo the biggest shock since the Second World War.

The result could see the shuttering of many universities, particularly small liberal arts colleges, accelerating a trend of rising closures since the Great Recession. At the same time, experts predict, the drop off in demand will be temporary, as a prolonged recession sends millions back to school—resulting in renewed profits, and power, for the schools that make it through to the other side.

When 20 million college students return to school this fall, their campuses will look very different. Schools are considering shortened school years, smaller class sizes, and keeping classes partially virtual. In addition to social distancing measures, Purdue University will use its on-campus laboratory to test students and trace contacts. The California State University system will be entirely online through the fall—its University of California sister schools are expected to follow suit.

These changes will radically alter not just campus life, but schools' balance sheets.

Added safety measures mean more expenses, Brown education professor Susanna Loeb told the Free Beacon. Colleges will need to pay fixed costs, like staff salaries and facilities maintenance, while simultaneously spending more on cleaning, testing, and added space for socially distanced classes and living. At the same time, money will stop flowing in; Robert Kelchen, a professor of higher education at Seton Hall University, said that colleges are expecting a 20 to 30 percent drop in revenue next year.

The net effect will be monumental. Hundrieser, whose organization represents over 1,900 schools, predicted that the crisis ""will transform the finances of a lot of institutions, and they'll have to be incredibly fiscally prudent and innovative in order for them to rebound in a year.""

""The effects of this crisis are likely to be much larger than the Great Recession,"" Kelchen said.

Universities, Kelchen explained, have four sources of income: tuition, public funding, on-campus fees (for housing, food services, etc.), and donations/endowments. Those funding streams are not equally distributed, however. Among 768 endowments surveyed by NACUBO, more than half of the value was held by the top 25, just 3 percent of schools.

Research funding is similarly concentrated: Data from the National Science Foundation show that the top 5 percent of recipient universities get over 60 percent of federal research dollars.

Wealthy Harvard or well-funded Johns Hopkins can smooth the coming bumps. But most colleges are dependent on either state budgets that are rapidly drying up, or on tuition and activities payments.

That explains why universities are scrambling to reopen. As Brown University president Christina Paxson wrote in the New York Times, ""remaining closed in the fall means losing as much as half of our revenue."" Even larger schools are afraid. Cornell University has a $7.3 billion endowment, but its president recently wrote that without a reopening, the school is looking at ""hundreds of millions"" in losses.

Unfortunately, absent a medical miracle, any reopening will only be partial—which still means substantial losses.

College costs a lot, over $40,000 at the average four-year school. For that much money, students expect the full package: not just classes, but the extracurriculars, parties, and social connections that come with attending a college.

Corona-college will be nothing like that, leaving many education consumers considering other options. Some will just be unwilling to keep forking out for online courses: Georgia resident Alex Popovich told the Free Beacon that his daughter, who is a freshman at William & Mary, is considering taking a semester off or taking classes at a local university in the fall if her school remains online.

Others are worried about in-person education: Thirty-five percent of students in a recent poll said that if colleges reopened in the fall, they would either only attend online (31 percent) or not attend at all (4 percent). Others are indecisive. One in six were considering taking a gap year as of April.

Those numbers might change further as it becomes apparent that many classes will remain online—63 percent of current students say e-learning is worse than in-person classes. Tuition will also be disproportionately affected by declining foreign enrollment, as foreign students generally pay full price.

Even if colleges manage a partial reopening, therefore, they will inevitably take a hit to their revenue. That's a recipe for financial disaster. As Paxson put it, ""It’s not a question of whether institutions will be forced to permanently close, it’s how many.""

Which colleges will be hardest hit? Kelchen said he was most worried about ""small, rural private colleges,"" where students will be less willing to travel to or live. Losing tuition and housing revenue, Kelchen said, ""will be more than these colleges can handle.""

Beth Akers, a higher education fellow at the Manhattan Institute, thinks the colleges most at risk are ""the expensive institutions that are offering that kind of boutique college experience, but ones that aren't sitting on the pile of cash that could help them weather this kind of storm."" Loeb noted that ""many small liberal arts schools"" were in financial straits even before the crisis began, adding ""that difficulty will likely increase.""

Will all of this mean the end of college education? Probably not—paradoxically, colleges which weather the crisis may find themselves on the other side with too many students, not too few. If one in six students take a gap year, then the fall of 2021 will see student populations swell.

There will be even more students if the current financial crisis persists and, as experts project, unemployment remains elevated. That's because in a recession, people return to school; college enrollment rose by 13 percent between 2007 and its peak in 2011.

""People like to go back to school"" when unemployment is high, education policy expert Preston Cooper told the Free Beacon. ""They say, ‘the labor market's really weak right now, there aren't a lot of job opportunities, this is my opportunity to go back and get that degree I always wanted.'""

Many of those who return will go back for associate's degrees, as enrollment in two-year colleges rose disproportionately during the Great Recession. Online colleges will likely also do well, as they have the infrastructure in place to absorb recession demand immediately. But high-prestige universities will benefit indirectly. The same demand, paired with lower supply, will necessarily lead potential students to attach more value to degrees.

Higher education resembles many other industries facing the coronavirus crisis. The small players look set to be decimated by the coming storm, while the ones that are big and wealthy enough to survive will wield even more power on the other side.",0
227,227,300,Covid-19: Moscow turns into Wuhan,"Moscow turns into Wuhan

The coronavirus infection in Russia continues spreading at a dangerous pace. There is no more optimistic scenario for the development of the crisis: the number of positive cases and deaths will continue to grow, while quarantine and restrictive measures will have to be extended.

In the USA, the pandemic progressed from 1,000 to 10,000 positive cases within 6 days; in Germany, Italy and Spain - eight days, in Austria - 15 days, and in Russia - 12 days. Five countries have already passed the mark of 100,000 patients within 15 or18 days.



Irresponsibility of citizens, especially young people who mistakenly believe that they are out of risk, makes preventive measures for the spread of the infection a lot less effective. The virus can affect anyone regardless of age. Moreover, nothing is known about the consequences that Covid-19 may cause for the human body. It may decrease physical stamina and change psychological peculiarities.



Tatyana Golikova, the Vice Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, believes that Russia is not going to be able to lift restrictions by May holidays.

""We do want to get out of this crisis on the eve of such a great holiday as Victory Day, but

we definitely won't be able to extricate from the crisis,"" she said.

In order to assess the situation, one needs to live through two cycles of 14 days in an epidemic (the average duration of the incubation period of the coronavirus). The first cycle is ending early this week, when specialists can say whether the situation with the spread of the virus has reached a plateau or continues to grow.



For the time being, the crisis continues to aggravate. Every days brings new records:

as many as 2,558 cases of new infection were confirmed in Russia within the last 24 hours

the number of positive cases of the infection grows in Russia by 25-30 percent

as of April 13, a total of 18,328 cases were registered in 82 regions in the country.

Russian authorities lose time

The Moscow authorities were forced to switch to stringent measures after they chose to start with soft restrictions two weeks ago. During this time, the number of infected people in Russia grew from 1,000 to 18,000.



Leading Russian economists earlier warned that non-working days without travel and social communication restrictions would be perceived as an unexpected holiday. Indeed, many chose to go to their dachas, others flocked to parks and other places of mass congregation of people.

A similar mistake was made a month before in Italy and led to disastrous consequences. Soft quarantine and non-working days led to an increase in morbidity rate. Italy declared strict quarantine, but it was too late.

Since last Monday, the number of infected people has doubled, while the infection rate has tripled. More than 11,500 coronavirus-positive patients are being treated at Moscow hospitals.

In late March, Muscovites were outraged by the ""draconian measures,"" which Mayor Sergei Sobyanin introduced in the city. Presently, it has become clear to everyone that the crisis in Moscow is rapidly developing according to scenarios of Italy or New York.

The scale of the disaster became obvious after the Ministry of Health allowed the diagnosis of coronavirus without tests, but only by CT, just based on symptoms, as was the case in the beginning of winter in China.",0
518,518,639,Justices wary of ‘Obamacare’ birth control coverage changes,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court seemed concerned Wednesday about the sweep of Trump administration rules that would allow more employers who cite a religious or moral objection to opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women as required by the Affordable Care Act.

The justices were hearing their third day of arguments conducted by telephone because of the coronavirus pandemic. The first of two cases before them Wednesday stemmed from the Obama-era health law, under which most employers must cover birth control as a preventive service, at no charge to women, in their insurance plans.

In 2017, the Trump administration announced it would broaden an exemption to the contraceptive coverage requirement that previously applied to houses of worship, such as churches, synagogues and mosques. But the change was blocked by courts.

The Supreme Court’s four liberal justices suggested they were troubled by the changes, which the government has estimated would cause about 70,000 women, and at most 126,000 women, to lose contraception coverage in one year.

Chief Justice John Roberts, a key vote on a court split between conservatives and liberals, suggested that the Trump administration’s reliance on a federal religious freedom law to expand the exemption was “too broad.”

And Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who joined the conversation from a Maryland hospital where she was being treated for an infection caused by a gallstone, gave the government’s top Supreme Court lawyer, Solicitor General Noel Franciso, what sounded like a lecture.

“You have just tossed entirely to the wind what Congress thought was essential, that is that women be provided these .... services with no hassle, no cost to them,” said Ginsburg, who is expected to be in the hospital for a day or two.

The court’s conservative justices seemed more willing to side with the administration, with Trump appointee Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting the administration’s changes might be considered “within the bounds of reasonable.”

Beyond exempting churches, synagogues and mosques from the contraceptive coverage requirement, the Obama administration also created a way by which religiously affiliated organizations including hospitals, universities and charities could opt out of paying for contraception, but women on their health plans would still get no-cost birth control. Some groups complained the opt-out process itself violated their religious beliefs.

That opt-out process was the subject of a previous Supreme Court case, but the court, with only eight justices at the time because of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, didn’t decide the issue. It instead sent both sides back to see if they could work out a compromise.

That didn’t happen. “Is it really the case that there is no way to resolve those differences?” Roberts asked at one point.

After the Trump administration took over, officials announced a rule change that allows many companies and organization with religious or moral objections to opt out of covering birth control without providing an alternate avenue for coverage.

New Jersey and Pennsylvania challenged the rules in court, and a judge blocked them from going into effect. The judge found the Trump administration did not follow proper procedures for issuing the rules. An appeals court agreed, and the administration appealed to the Supreme Court to step in, as did the Little Sisters of the Poor. The order of Roman Catholic nuns had been instrumental in challenging the Obama administration rules.

But on Wednesday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned why the Little Sisters of the Poor were even at the court because for a number of reasons they don’t have to provide contraceptive coverage. Sotomayor also referenced the coronavirus pandemic during her questioning, asking attorney Paul Clement, who was representing the nuns, whether an employer might be able to object to paying for a coronavirus vaccine. He said “no.”

Even though the Trump rules remain blocked, a ruling by a federal judge in Texas in June already allows most people who object to covering contraception to avoid doing so.

In the second case the justices heard Wednesday, political consultants and pollsters were among those asking the Supreme Court to strike down a federal law from 1991 that bars them from making robocalls to cellphones. The case only arose after Congress in 2015 created an exception in the law that allows the automated calls for collection of government debt.

The court wrestled with whether it could get rid of just the government-debt restriction or would have to invalidate the entire ban on cellphone robocalls. “No one wants robocalls on their cellphone,” Roberts said, though he typically votes for the challengers in free-speech cases.

The argument provided a light moment of the day when Justice Stephen Breyer got cut off when someone tried calling him. Breyer said after he rejoined the court’s arguments: “The telephone started to ring, and it cut me off the call and I don’t think it was a robocall.”",1
845,845,1014,The Horror of the Coronavirus Data Lag,"Humans tend to think of illness as a binary. You are sick or you aren’t, which feels simple and knowable. In reality, most types of communicable disease are far less black and white: People are infected before they become aware that they’re sick. For much of the outbreak in the United States, local officials have asked people who suspect that they have COVID-19 but aren’t having serious trouble breathing to avoid seeking medical attention. That means that by the time most infections become official cases, people have spent days or weeks trying to heal on their own before seeking care. The periods of information lag with COVID-19 are longer than those of the colds and flus to which it’s often compared, which has been a central problem in containing the virus since the beginning. In order to make predictions and policy from any particular day’s case numbers, health experts have to synthesize information about testing rates, positive rates, local guidelines, and anything known about how people are responding to instructions to stay home or get back to business. And in order to make everyday decisions and assess their own risk, people have to live simultaneously in the past, present, and future.

Asking the general public to think in such broad and uncertain timescales is a tall order. “The concept of an incubation period or the onset of severe disease—those aren’t things that the public is well versed in, nor should we expect them to be,” says Tom Hipper, who manages the Center for Public Health Readiness and Communication at Drexel University. As a result, keeping the slow progression of a disease in mind can be difficult for regular people trying to make sense of official statistics. “As humans, I think we like instant gratification and we like instant feedback on things,” Hipper told me. The lull between new behavior and its measurable results “can make it a little more difficult to see the connection.”

Liz Neeley: How to talk about the coronavirus

The snail’s pace at which COVID-19 infections seem to run their course makes public-health communications about the state of the current outbreak unusually complicated. The available evidence suggests that it usually takes about five days for an infected person to go from transmission to symptoms, but it can take as long as 14 days and the person infected will be contagious for much of that time. The flu, by comparison, goes from transmission to symptoms in an average of two days and a maximum of four, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and most people are infectious for only about a day before becoming ill.

Public-health experts can’t change the pace at which COVID-19 moves once a person is infected, but information doesn’t have to be delayed as much as it currently is in the U.S. The speed at which cases of the disease become known to the medical system, government monitors, and the general public depends on how hard a state or country is trying to find them. So far, the best-case scenario seems to be what’s happened in South Korea. In January and February, as the situation in Wuhan, China, deteriorated, South Korea quickly began identifying and isolating infectious travelers from the country, seeking the contacts of known cases, and testing those people before they became symptomatic. This program of testing, tracing, and swift isolation meant South Korea had something closer to real-time information about how the disease was spreading within its borders, and it was able to control the outbreak quickly. Such proactive approaches allowed South Korea, Germany, and Hong Kong to relax some of their restrictions on business and travel, and to quickly identify any new outbreaks that resulted. But even with those measures, all have experienced an uptick in new cases after reopening.",1
717,717,873,Amazon asks Congress to pass a law against price gouging during national crisis,"Amazon has requested that Congress pass a law that would make price gouging illegal during times of national crisis, in light of inflated prices on crucial goods like hand sanitizer and N95 masks that have hounded the online retailer during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In an open letter posted by Brian Huseman, Amazon’s VP of public policy, the company highlights its own ongoing efforts to try to crack down on price gouging. To date, Amazon says that it’s removed half a million price-gouged listings from its online stores and has banned 4,000 seller accounts on its US store alone for violating its Fair Pricing Policy. And as CEO Jeff Bezos noted in a letter to investors, Amazon has set up a special line of communication for state attorneys general to directly pass along price gouging complaints.

Amazon says that it can only do so much on its own

But Amazon says that it can only do so much on its own. The company says that inconsistent state standards limit its ability to crack down on price gouging — while laws against raising prices during times of crisis currently exist in about two-thirds of the US, the rules are highly inconsistent from state to state. Amazon can kick off as many bad sellers as it can for violating its own policies, but there are often few subsequent legal consequences to help regulate inflated prices.

A federal law, Amazon says, would ensure that there are “no gaps in protection for consumers” and would help Amazon and other retailers “more effectively prevent bad actors and ensure fair prices.”

Amazon’s proposal would see a price gouging law that “should kick in immediately when the federal government declares a public health crisis or national emergency, which will leave no room for doubt for businesses and enforcement agencies. It should also establish clear pricing standards, define who and what are covered by the law, and ensure strong enforcement authority.”

Unsurprisingly, Amazon’s proposed legislation would ensure that only the party that sets the price — like, say, a bad third-party Amazon retailer — be held liable for the inflated price, not the storefront (i.e. Amazon) that hosts that seller and facilitates the sale.",1

650,650,790,Chinese Americans in Chicago donate 1 million surgical masks to city’s first-responders,"A group of Chinese American business leaders has donated 1 million surgical masks to first-responders and others in Chicago, saying Chicagoans did the same thing for China when the coronavirus emerged there at the beginning of the year.

“We are grateful to the frontline responders who are risking their well-being to protect Chicago neighborhoods,” said Citadel Securities CEO Peng Zhao, who organized the donation with his wife Cherry Chen.

The effort follows months of President Donald Trump blaming China for the pandemic.

On Monday, when a Chinese American reporter asked the president why he sees testing for the coronavirus as a “global competition,” he responded, “Maybe that’s a question you should ask China.” On Tuesday, Trump tweeted: “Asian Americans are VERY angry at what China has done to our Country, and the World. Chinese Americans are the most angry of all.”

Zhao and more than a dozen other Chinese American business leaders bought the masks and asked the University of Chicago Crime Lab to help distribute them.

About 750,000 of the masks are going to the Chicago Department of Public Health, which will provide them to Chicago police officers and other city workers who need them, according to the crime lab. More than 500 officers have tested positive for COVID-19, and three have died.

About 100,000 masks will go to the Chicago Public Schools. Masks also are being given to nonprofits that work with at-risk youth.

The distribution of the masks began May 4.

Roseanna Ander, executive director of the crime lab, said the donation comes at a time China is under fire by Trump and others and said, “We all have a common enemy in COVID-19 and a shared interest in stopping its spread, protecting our brave frontline responders and ultimately finding a vaccine.”

Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel and Chicago’s richest man, is paying for cleaning supplies and medical equipment for cops and other first-responders. He also donated $2.5 million to feed Chicago schoolchildren during the pandemic. In early February, he and his companies contributed $7.5 million to help China’s Hubei province, where the pandemic began.",1
114,114,162,We asked Chicago: How are you adjusting to social distancing?,"Chicagoans are coping with the demands of social distancing differently. Some have transitioned to working from home, others are required to venture out each day to “essential” workplaces, and many are experiencing unemployment.

We took to the streets (while maintaining a 6-foot distance) to ask Chicago residents about their “new normal” amid the coronavirus pandemic. Here’s what they had to say:

Ricardo Davila, engineer

“I’m an electrical engineer, we do the sign and planning of different facilities. I’ve been under self quarantine for the past couple of weeks which means I’ve been working from home. I typically do not do that. I avoid going outside at all costs but its a little bit hard to keep myself locked up all day. What I do is take moments like this to take a little break and go outside for a five minute, 10 minute walk. I keep myself away from people. I do not go to any public places where people could be and just keep some sort of healthy habits in my daily routine.”

“Me personally, I’m an extrovert. I like to be around people, to talk to people. I love to talk to people so it’s been tough but I’ve been trying to identify that and be like I need to have discipline.”

Jason, college student

“I think this is the first time I’ve left my house since probably two weeks. I think it’s important to keep practicing social distancing even when you are out. I’m trying to avoid visiting places and talking to other people. I’m sure my mental health has declined staying inside the last two weeks. It’s messing with my education. I haven’t been able to go to school in three weeks now.”

“I don’t even think things will really go back to normal, the way they were before this. It just changed the whole narrative for everything. It changed everything pretty much.”

Nycole Stoudt, Service industry employee

“I work in the restaurant industry so we were kind of early on shut downs. I think everybody is a little nervous about what they are going to do to pay their bills, rent especially. We have zoom cocktail hours set up for later this evening to kind of bring everybody together and just say hi to each other.”

“The Sunday when Governor [J.B.] Pritzker announced restaurants and bars would be closing, that was a big moment for me where it’s like ok things are really going to change drastically and we all need to take the steps necessary to quell any further passing on of the virus to others. It’s boring but it’s not the worst thing in the world to have to stay in a little bit more.”

Karen and Richard Shapiro, retired

KS: “I’m 73 and he’s 76, we’re healthy. I don’t think about it. I kind of feel like by now if we don’t have it we’re all carriers. I don’t think there’s anybody who is not a carrier. I just use that mindset and be careful.”

RS: “I’m not concerned at all. There’s so many people they haven’t tested so they really don’t know how extensive this could be, but they’re getting there.”

KS: “We’ll get through it.”

Joanna Griffin, Healthcare worker

“Unfortunately I have to come out to defeat the battle and help the team out as much as possible. This is part of being in healthcare. For the team that I’m working for they are understaffed right now but everyone is just really trying to be optimistic and do the first thing first, making sure we take care of the patients.”

“I’ve been doing about five days a week and I’ve been going by METRA. The perfect thing about this is there aren’t too many people on the train. It’s not too bad. I had my concerns making sure they are clean on the trains. METRA is very good about that. I have no concerns about that, I know they’ve definitely been doing their part of safety first.”

Barry DeBois, Actor/Singer

“I was bartending between those things and then I quit my bartending job to start a theater gig and then that got canceled because all theater is being canceled at the moment. I still have to pay rent.”

“Basically I’m trying to take gigs where I’m keeping my distance from people but those are very limited jobs. I’ve talked to friends in the theater community and they’re doing different stuff. Some people are teaching english to people in China. There are a lot of remote teaching opportunities people have gotten into.”

“If I’m not working in theater I’m working in the service industry and both of those are demolished right now. So I don’t know when I’m going to make normal money again which is kind of scary. We just moved into this new, beautiful apartment.”

Tamas Vilaghy, Service industry employee

“I work at a wine shop and there was a bar component which has shut we’re figuring out if we can do take out and carry out and delivery. The wine shop has remained open so that’s giving me a little bit of income.”

“I live with my wife so it’s nice to have someone there. We take a walk at night but that’s about it. She’s a musician so all of her gigs have dried up. She’s trying to teach over zoom right now but it’s uncertain as well whether or not that can continue. The teachers I know are at a loss about this too.”",1
542,542,664,Why too much exercise during your coronavirus quarantine is not a good thing,"The coronavirus crisis upended most Americans’ lifestyles in March — including their exercise routines.

Zipping past pedestrians during a run or lifting weights at the gym right after someone else are things of the past, with socially distanced running routes and at-home workouts becoming more mainstream.

But if you find yourself with extra time on your hands and the sudden urge to channel your coronavirus anxiety into breaking a sweat, make sure you’re doing so safely. Because, yes, there is such a thing as getting too much exercise. And overdoing it could actually do more harm than good, pandemic or otherwise.

What is the right amount of exercise during the coronavirus crisis?

The standard exercise recommendations are simple: Adults should be getting at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity every week (like brisk walking), and do muscle-strengthening activities two days per week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You can, of course, mix the moderate physical activity with more vigorous exercise like running.

You might logically assume that more exercise is better because you have more time on your hands, but that’s not really the case. Benefits top out at about 300 minutes per week.

“Whatever your regular exercise routine was, I wouldn’t alter it because of COVID-19 per se,” says Linda S. Pescatello, a kinesiology professor at the University of Connecticut.

Chris Travers, an exercise physiologist at Cleveland Clinic Sports Health, points out that any amount of exercise is better than none. Research shows that even a five-minute walk or run is helping improve your cardiovascular system, and that you can do a total body strength program in seven minutes, he says.

How can I tell if I’m exercising too much?

You can experience a host of symptoms when overexercising. These include:

Loss of appetite

Headache

Muscle soreness and tenderness

Fatigue (not during, but later)

Injury

Higher pulse (10 or more beats) the day after exercising

Irritability

Difficulty concentrating

Reduced self-esteem

Weakened immune system

Beyond roughly 300 minutes of working out, you’re probably not gaining much more benefit anyway, says Robert Sallis, co-director of the Sports Medicine Fellowship at Kaiser Permanente.

The overarching rule is to “listen to your body,” Travers says. It’s OK to skip a day if you’re feeling fatigued.

If you’re feeling severe symptoms such as dizziness, chest pain or fainting, seek medical attention.

Am I more susceptible to the new coronavirus if I exercise too much?

It’s still too soon to make any kind of definitive determination.

Pescatello cautions that while it’s unclear if you could be more susceptible, you wouldn’t want to put yourself in a position of weakening your immune system, given the unknowns.

Though studies aren’t available for COVID-19, we know other viruses are much less likely to affect humans who exercise regularly, Sallis says.

David Nieman, a biology department professor at Appalachian State University, says people shouldn’t even be thinking about overtraining (more than 300 minutes per week) right now.

Existing research data supports the view that overtraining isn’t recommended in parts of the world where COVID-19 transmission risk is high.

“Intense exercise when infected with COVID-19 or other systemic viruses should be avoided,” Nieman says in a review paper coming out in June in the Journal of Sport and Health Science. The U.S. has more than 1 million coronaviruses cases, per Johns Hopkins data.

Now more than ever, though, physical activity is important to strengthen immune function and combat psychological stressors associated with the pandemic.

“Exercise is our best medicine to try to combat those,” Sallis says.

I typically don’t exercise. How can I start safely?

Remember that fitness levels vary person to person. That 150-minute threshold might be too much if you’re starting out, Pescatello says.

Just lacing up your running sneakers won’t turn you into Olympic champion Usain Bolt. In fact, trying a new exercise at a high intensity could prove dangerous.

“You’re not going to improve your physical fitness in a day, but you could hurt yourself in a day,” Travers says. He normally advises patients to walk before they run — literally.

On the flip side: What if your typical exercise routine is gone because of pandemic restrictions? Keep in mind that activities as basic as going for a walk could prove beneficial. Activities like tennis, hiking and bike riding are other socially distanced options to consider for exercise.

You’ll be thankful later. Nieman thinks this epidemic is a wake-up call to the world to reverse trends of obesity and lack of exercise to keep immune systems in solid shape.

“We can do a lot with exercise and leanness to help fend off the virus, or if we get it, to reduce the symptoms and the duration of the symptoms,” Nieman says.

I’ve been training for a race. Should I still run the distance?

You can continue to train for that race you were getting excited about. Alternatively, you can find an event for this fall and start training again.

If you opt to run your distance anyway, see if you can participate in the event virtually if a race is taking that approach. It won’t be the same as you planned, but it’s still a way to achieve that goal.

Remember, though, that running a full marathon can prove a great strain on a body. Nieman recommends people don’t train for a marathon (a 26.2-mile race) until the virus is under control.

So what’s the major takeaway? When it comes to exercise, don’t overdo it, but don’t do nothing. Regular daily exercise gives a boost to immune cells that target viruses when they enter the bloodstream, and exercise will better your mental health, too.

“You don’t really have to do a lot to get these tremendous (exercise) benefits,” Sallis says.

742,742,902,The reason there’s still a pasta shortage.,"Bad news unless you’re making lasagne. Scott Heins/Getty Images

With Americans stocking up on affordable, shelf-stable foods, pasta has become a mainstay of the quarantine pantry—when customers can find any. Because of a considerable jump in demand, pasta companies have been reporting roughly 30 percent increases in the volume they have to produce to keep grocery stores supplied. “Dry pasta [production] had been flat for the past number of years, and it has significantly increased since the pandemic began,” said Carl Zuanelli, chairman of the National Pasta Association and CEO of Nuovo Pasta. “We really started to see panic buying toward the end of February, beginning of March.”

But why, in at least some places, are pasta shelves still bereft of product? It’s not like we’re importing it from coronavirus-scarred Italy. The vast majority of pasta consumed in the U.S. is produced domestically, including from Italian brands like Barilla. The angel hair or penne on your plate originally came from durum wheat grown on a farm likely located in North Dakota or Montana, where the hot, arid days and cool nights allow the amber-colored crop to thrive. After the harvest, millers grind the durum to produce coarse semolina flour, which factories can then mix with water and extrude to make pasta. With the ongoing surge in demand, every part of the process has had to shift into a higher gear.

Many farms and mills already had reserves of durum that they could draw on during the initial weeks of the coronavirus crisis, according to James Meyer, CEO of the flour producer Italgrani. Yet the St. Louis company, which is the largest semolina and durum miller in North America, still had to kick up production. Italgrani produces flour to order, so at the beginning of each week it determines how many days the mill should run to fulfill orders from pasta factories. In normal times, the mill runs 24 hours a day, five days a week. Italgrani bumped up to 24/7 in April.

During the initial spike, Meyer feared that transportation could be an issue. Italgrani typically has to determine the right number of food-grade rail cars that can accommodate the amount of flour it’s shipping. Most years it reserves fewer cars during the spring and summer, when there’s usually a decline in pasta consumption. It had to act quickly to increase the size of its leased rail car fleet, though it was able to do so in time before capacity became a problem. The company was also in a good position because Class I railroads have been carrying fewer items for struggling industries like oil and auto manufacturing, freeing up more capacity for goods like wheat and flour. “Demand is up. We’ve been grinding more and shipping that to our customers,” says Meyer. “Transit times for both the raw materials coming to us and for the finished product going to our customers have been very good.”

In normal times, the Italgrani flour mill runs 24 hours a day, five days a week. It bumped up to 24/7 in April.

At the manufacturing level, where the semolina flour becomes pasta, employees have been working overtime and taking on more shifts. “We generally run at 80 percent of capacity [at the factory]. We’re now at 105 percent of capacity,” said Linda Schalles, director of special operations for the Philadelphia Macaroni Company, which recently became America’s largest privately owned pasta manufacturer after acquiring Zerega Pasta. “We’re working 24/7.”

In February, before the U.S. experienced a major outbreak, the Philadelphia Macaroni Company’s machine-maker warned the company that pasta was flying off the shelves in Italy as the coronavirus wrought havoc. Executives worked to quickly secure masks, hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol, and other supplies that would allow its factories to keep operating. The company’s plants also began shifting production processes to focus on more popular generic pasta shapes like elbow macaroni and spaghetti, rather than on specialty products like tricolor rotini. “We’ve had to put some of those customers [for specialty pastas] off because we have to fill demand for the broadest products that are in the middle of the aisle. We fill up those shelves,” Schalles said.

According to Schalles, the biggest bottleneck the company has been facing is hiring enough workers and getting them onto the production floor. The pasta-making industry usually has high turnover rates, which Schalles attributes to the uncomfortably hot working conditions caused by the machines that dry the product, and its need for more workers has only grown during the pandemic. The company recently bought out large digital billboards with hiring ads at major intersections in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and other cities where its factories are located. It has also been handing out business cards to line workers in the hopes that they’ll use them to recruit friends. The procedures that the Philadelphia Macaroni Company has put in place to screen people for the virus, which includes daily temperature checks and health surveys, also create a chokepoint in terms of getting employees to their workstations. Zuanelli notes that ramping up production in this respect has been slightly easier for companies like his that have become increasingly reliant on automation for tasks like flour mixing and packaging. The machines just have to run for a longer amount of time and undergo modifications to increase the yield.

Another obstacle that factories are running into is packaging. Some manufacturers that usually sell pasta in bulk to the service industry have been pivoting to retail, where most of the demand has been moving. But the pasta has to be repackaged into smaller containers, the materials for which can be tough to find. “One company may be able to shift their product into consumer packs, but then there’s concerns with the purchasing of the plastics, the corrugated boxes, and the unit cardboard boxes. That poses a challenge [to source],” says Zuanelli.

For now, companies are fairly confident they’ll be able to provide for the home-cooked pasta renaissance long-term. Pasta executives are worried, though, that the coronavirus itself could endanger the workforce and incapacitate the supply chain, similar to what the meat industry is experiencing. Zuanelli notes he hasn’t heard of positive cases at pasta manufacturing facilities thus far, which he attributes to the fact that it takes fewer people to produce a pound of pasta compared with other foods. Yet trying to ensure that the illness doesn’t infiltrate the facilities while also increasing production volume is no easy feat. “It would be one thing if it was just a turn of a light switch to get more supply in the market,” Zuanelli says. “But we’re trying to do so with one hand tied behind our back, trying to ramp up workplace protocols to protect our employees’ safety. That’s the principal issue we’ve all had to grapple with.”

1326,1329,1803,Behind Trump’s demand to reopen churches: Slipping poll numbers and alarm inside his campaign,"“I did a number of briefings with donors and key stakeholders and said the longer this goes on, there’s going to be a perceptible and predictable float-down once you get past the initial rally-around-the-flag upswing,” said Ralph Reed, a top Trump surrogate and director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition.

“Now you’re in this trough and what voters are going to do is they’re going to wait and render a verdict once they’ve assessed the job President Trump has done to bring the economy back into recovery coming out of the pandemic,” he added.

Following the PRRI survey, which was conducted while Trump was a dominant presence at televised daily briefings by his administration's coronavirus task force, Pew Research Center released new data last week that showed a 7-point increase from April to May in white Catholics who disapprove of Trump’s response to the Covid-19 crisis and a 6-point decline among white evangelicals who previously gave him positive marks.

Trump campaign aides, White House officials and outside allies are responding to the threat by boosting their outreach to religious voters and promising to prioritize religious gatherings as they push to reopen the U.S. economy. Administration officials have conducted multiple calls with conservative Christian groups to ensure their support over the past two months. Trump himself recently attended an online worship service hosted by St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York. And Vice President Mike Pence held a roundtable with faith leaders in Iowa earlier this month. Reed said his organization is planning a get-out-the-vote campaign three times as large as its effort in 2016.

The president’s reelection operation “will engage the Christian community nationwide to overwhelmingly reelect President Trump in 2020,” Trump campaign spokesman Ken Farnaso said in a statement.

“In addition to his extraordinary record on conservative and faith-based issues, he has appointed well over 180 solid, conservative federal judges … defended religious freedoms and has stood as the most pro-life president we’ve ever had,” Farnaso added.

On Thursday, Trump also floated a potential move by his administration to reopen houses of worship in the near future.

“The churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of Democratic governors,” Trump said as he left the White House to visit a ventilator factory in Michigan. “I want to get our churches open. We will take a very strong position on that very soon.”

Some Trump allies have attributed the recent slump in the president’s support to the closure of churches that Trump addressed on Friday. Social-distancing guidelines forced most churches to suspend in-person worship or move Sunday services into the virtual sphere, and one member of the Trump campaign’s “Evangelicals for Trump” coalition suggested that faith leaders and parishioners who have been frustrated by the limitations are mistakenly blaming Trump. (Religious institutions in Kentucky, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee, Louisiana and California have all brought legal challenges against their states for restrictions on religious activities and gatherings.)

“Those who don’t understand the legalities of the process could be blaming the president or the administration when the federal government is dealing with states’ rights issues,” said Mark Burns, a South Carolina pastor and prominent Trump supporter.

It was not immediately clear whether the president's order on Friday — that state and local officials must take immediate action to reopen religious institutions — was legally permissible, nor was it clear how administration officials planned to enforce the guidance.

Guidelines released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about reopening certain establishments — including schools, public transit systems and child care facilities — did not mention how religious institutions should go about returning to in-person worship services and ministry opportunities. One senior administration official said the guidance was omitted due to concerns that the prescriptions CDC staffers planned to provide were too restrictive.

It’s unlikely that critics of church closings alone are responsible for the decline in Trump’s favorability among critical religious demographics. According to the Pew survey, 43 percent of white evangelicals and 52 percent of white Catholics think the current restrictions on public activity in their areas are appropriate versus 42 percent and 31 percent, respectively, who think fewer restrictions would be better. Greater shares of white evangelicals and white Catholics also said they are more afraid about their state governments lifting restrictions on public activity too soon than they are about leaving the restrictions in place for too long.

As the coronavirus-related death toll approaches 100,000 and outbreaks emerge in locations where social distancing is more difficult, Laura Gifford, a historian of politics and religion at George Fox University, said it’s likely become harder for the president’s supporters to embrace his plans for an accelerated reopening of the country. The more Trump contradicts health officials who have warned against reopening schools and nonessential businesses, she suggested, the less accepting his usual supporters might become of his overall response.

“If grandma’s retirement home is suffering from an outbreak, there’s pretty good evidence that something is awry and it makes it difficult to ignore what public health experts are saying,” Gifford said. “This is something where that is harder to ignore than previous controversies or crises because it has life-and-death consequences for congregations and religious populations.”

Part of the strategy Trump allies have adopted to protect his relationship with conservative Christians is to frame the novel coronavirus — and church closures in response to social distancing restrictions — as a threat to religious freedom. The president’s religious supporters routinely cite religious liberty as one of their top priorities and an area in which they believe the Trump administration has been exceptionally receptive.",1
233,233,307,"In the aftermath of COVID-19, expanding Medicare, Medicaid could save lives","Many American states and municipalities have instituted measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 and “flatten the curve” of the estimated morbidity and mortality that may occur in the United States.

These measures include closing “non-essential” businesses, schools, universities and public services for a specified time period. Other measures focus on “social distancing” and prohibiting meetings, sports events and other public gatherings.

Opinion

Despite our best preventive health measures, thousands of people are expected to be hospitalized. This will be expensive.

ProPublica and the Harvard Global Health Institute have recently released a fascinating analysis of U.S. national, regional and municipal hospital capacity and how it relates to COVID-19.

The report looks at U.S. hospital capacity under various scenarios. The report asks what would happen to an area’s hospital capacity if 20%, 40% or 60% of an area’s population were infected with COVID-19 over a six-month, 12-month or 18-month interval.

For example, Chicago would reach approximately 120% of total hospital capacity if 20% of the population were infected in six months, according to this model. However, if 20% of Chicago’s population were infected over 18 months, hospital capacity would not be reached.

Many of those who have been infected with COVID-19 will be admitted to intensive care units with respiratory failure and will require support with mechanical ventilators.

The health insurance dilemma caused by unemployment

A majority of Americans receive their health insurance through their jobs. But on April 2, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that over 6 million people filed for unemployment benefits.

Many of these people have lost their health insurance and have joined the ranks of the approximately 28 million Americans who had no health insurance prior to the COVID-19 crisis.

It has been estimated that just one hospitalization for COVID-19 may range from $38,000 to $74,000. So not only must families worry about contracting COVID-19, they may also have to worry about being uninsured and, if someone becomes ill, potentially having to take dire financial steps, including filing for bankruptcy.

A potential solution

The Trump administration has recently stated that it would help hospitals by providing coverage for uninsured COVID-19 patients. But a better way to solve this problem might be to look at two very successful health programs — Medicare and Medicaid. These two programs could be expanded. The expansion would cover many of those uninsured Americans.

While the Trump administration’s plan to help uninsured COVID-19 patients is laudable, the plan does little to help uninsured patients who have other health issues requiring hospitalization. Here are a couple of suggestions to fix things:

• Consider lowering the age of Medicare eligibility to 60 years. This would help those working people who are not old enough to have Medicare eligibility, which begins at age 65.

• Relax the criteria for Medicaid eligibility. This can be done through an 1115 waiver. This provision allows a state to request additional funding and flexibility in determining eligibility in providing care to those who qualify for Medicaid. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has applied for a such a waiver for Illinois.

Both these steps will help us be better prepared for health care in the COVID-19 era . . . and the post-COVID-19 era.

We need to pressure the Congress and the Trump administration to address the long-term issue of health care and the uninsured by expanding eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid.

479,479,585,Chicago’s African American women restaurateurs ‘refuse to lose’ their livelihoods to pandemic,"Keisha Rucker, co-owner of Hyde Park’s The Soul Shack had just celebrated the restaurant’s one-year anniversary two days before Gov. J.B. Pritzker ordered the state’s bars and restaurants to close to dine-in customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Outside of attending college at DePaul University, Rucker has never truly left Hyde Park.

Attending Shoesmith and William H. Ray elementary schools, and Kenwood Academy, along with opening up the eatery on 53rd Street (the neighborhood’s business epicenter) has earned her the nickname “Mz. Hyde Park.”

Since the executive order took effect, however, she says she has lost 80% of her business.

“We have been able to stay open every day so far; free delivery service is currently keeping the business afloat,” said Rucker. “So I have been able to keep most of my staff with full-time positions.

“I had a straight business plan for dining and carryout delivery service and I had to revamp my whole system within less than 30 days when they came down with a stay-at-home order. So far, I have been able to keep the business open; that is my community.”

On Wednesdays, Soul Shack gives free meals to Hyde Park’s homeless community. The meal consists of fried chicken and two sides — called “South Sides.”

“Typically, it’s normally for the people that are in the area; we pretty much know who they are,” said Rucker. “So it’s normally like a maximum of maybe 10 people that come in on Wednesdays. … I typically do that all the time, but now it has increased.”

While some restaurants have shuttered temporarily due to the pandemic, there are others with owners who plan to stay open for as long as they can. Those owned by African American women are getting crushed particularly hard as the economy reels from the new carryout/delivery/pickup-only reality. Restaurant owners are creating new ways to weather the pandemic.

Lexington Betty’s Smoke House co-owner Dominique Leach is no stranger to dealing with catastrophe.

Leach, a Humboldt Park native, started her business with a food truck — which was later set on fire. The pandemic has more recently caused her to shut down two locations on the South (the Pullman location reopened Friday) and West Sides (Austin), along with cutting back on hours when she reopened them.

“Unfortunately, this came at a time where we were really getting some recognition for our hard work,” said Leach. “And, you know, I can only be optimistic. And we’re just happy enough to be getting enough revenue to at least keep the bills paid We’ve come down from 14 employees to just myself, my wife, who’s the other owner, and one employee.

“We have one driver working with the helper with deliveries. … and it’s just enough to get by. And we’re happy to have that — it could be a lot worse. And so I’m going to take the positives and be optimistic about the future.”

During the pandemic, Lexington Betty’s Smoke House has donated meals to Rush University Medical Center employees and 5th District police officers.

“Just know that we’re all in this together, and when we reopen, we’ll celebrate with the community and we just hope to get everybody’s support. We’ll be here at the end of this,” said Leach.

Due to the pandemic, Annah Mitchell, owner of Gobble Doggs, a turkey hotdog-centric food truck, had to temporarily shutter her LaSalle Street Metra station kiosk and cease construction of a restaurant she planned to open. Last year, her business launched a scholarship — raising funds via tips — for young entrepreneurs.

With her truck temporarily out of service amid COVID-19, she’s made the pivot to driving for the online grocery delivery service Instacart, and taking orders for catering.

“I’ve been doing anything that I possibly can,” said Mitchell. “I certainly want to make sure that the business stays on people’s minds and we’re continuing to market the business.”

Mitchell is determined to not let the pandemic take her livelihood away.

“This is a self-financed business and so everything that I’ve put into this business is mine — the blood, the money, the sweat, the tears,” said Mitchell. “So when I look at everything that I have put on the line for this, I cannot lose. I refuse to lose; I can’t let this go. This means too much to me … I cannot let this go.”",1
141,141,197,"Lawmakers urge ICE, CBP to release thousands of immigrants amid coronavirus pandemic","Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and legal advocates called on federal authorities Tuesday to release thousands of immigrants being held in detention centers and county jails nationwide to cull the spread of the coronavirus.

About 38,000 immigrants are in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and several thousands more are being held at facilities near the country’s borders by Customs and Border Protection.

All of those immigrants are being held on civil matters — namely, entering or residing in the United States without proper authorization — and are either waiting for their day in immigration court or have already been ordered deported.

ICE and CPB should release immigrants who are awaiting to go in front of a judge and pose no threat to public safety to prevent the disease from spreading throughout the tight confines of detention centers, Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told reporters Tuesday.

“Thankfully, we’ve seen some judges order the release of a handful of vulnerable immigrants in custody. It also appears that ICE has been quietly releasing a few immigrants in some detention facilities, but this simply isn’t enough,” he said.

So far, there are four confirmed cases of COVID-19 among those in ICE custody along with five confirmed cases among ICE employees and personnel working in detention facilities. BuzzFeed News reports ICE is monitoring 63 detainees in 22 detention facilities.

Lawmakers suspect those numbers will rise dramatically as immigrants in detention facilities aren’t able to practice adequate social distancing.

“We’re calling on ICE to act now ... because we know that people will die if we don’t take action,” said Rep. Linda Sánchez (D-Calif.), who heads the caucus’ task force on immigration.

Detention centers are routinely criticized for not providing adequate medical care for immigrants. Ten immigrants have died while in ICE custody since October and seven children have died in CPB custody or shortly after being released, “many after receiving delayed medical care or being denied care altogether,” according to the ACLU.

“We know that detention centers do not have the sanitary conditions required to contain the potential outbreak of coronavirus inside their facilities,” said Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia (D-Ill.).

Tania Linares Garcia, a senior attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center, said one of her clients — a young man who’s lived in Chicago for most of his life and is being held at a detention center in Wisconsin — suffers from anxiety “and really isn’t doing well right now.”

“There’s no way for him to protect himself — no access to gloves, masks, anything to keep his living quarters clean. He feels like a sitting duck.”

1288,1290,1715,A Timeline--Pandemic and Erosion of Freedoms Have Been Decades in the Making,"

Originally published on www.childrenshealthdefense.org

From the moment of ""COVID-19's"" naming--and particularly since the imposition of unprecedented restrictions on ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness""--some people have smelled a rat. And with each passing week, the smell becomes worse. A growing chorus of ordinary citizens and world-renowned medical and scientific experts is raising questions about matters ranging from the coronavirus's origins to the rationale for continued lockdowns (see here, here and here).

The mainstream media have shown themselves only too ready to lob ad hominem attacks against any and all such non-conformists. However, one does not have to be insensitive to the illness and deaths associated with COVID-19 to recognize that powerful agendas are riding on the coattails of SARS-CoV-2. Citizens are waking up to the fact that the countries, officials and public figures who embrace draconian interventions such as immunity certificates, microchipping, forced vaccination and the removal of children from their homes also approve of making our sovereign rights--whether to earn a living, maintain bodily integrity, congregate to practice our spirituality, enjoy the arts or protect and educate our children--contingent upon our acceptance of these Big Brother measures and technologies.

To make it easier for the public to assess what is happening and what is at stake, Children's Health Defense has put together the following timeline of selected events. We invite readers to consider how these events--some of them seemingly unrelated--and the network of partnerships and relationships that they illustrate have contributed to the unfolding set of circumstances in which we now find ourselves.

Notes/Explanatory Context

Gain-of-function research: COVID-19 has prompted renewed questioning about a long-debated branch of virology that, around 2012, scientists benignly rebranded as ""gain-of-function"" (GOF) research. GOF experiments seek to generate viruses ""with properties that do not exist in nature"" or, stated another way, ""alter a pathogen to make it more transmissible or deadly."" One of the leading proponents of GOF work is Dr. Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC), a ""legend in coronavirology"" and ""trailblazer of synthetic genomic manipulation techniques"" who specializes in engineering lethal coronaviruses from ""mail-order DNA."" Baric and other GOF enthusiasts argue that this type of viral tinkering is ""critical to the development of broad-based vaccines and therapeutics,"" but critics, such as Dr. Thomas Inglesby (director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security), dispute this putative benefit.

Big Data and Big Telecom: Children's Health Defense Chairman Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Dafna Tachover (director of CHD's ""Stop 5G and Wireless Harms Project"") wrote on May 8: ""5G has almost nothing to do with improving your lives; it's all about controlling your life, marketing products, and harvesting your data for Artificial Intelligence purposes. The 21st century's 'black gold' is data."" They note that Bill Gates, along with a number of other players and companies, is helping set up a ""microwave radiation-emitting spider web [that] will allow Big Data/Big Telecom and Big Brother to capture what happens inside and outside every person at every moment of life"" using a sinister brain-machine interface and other technologies, many financed by Gates. In short, ""While the lockdown is a cataclysm for the world economy, it is an opportunity for Gates"" and his billionaire brotherhood, ably assisted by an unadmirable fleet of medical and scientist yes-men.

2003

October 28: A paper by the Baric research group at UNC describes their synthetic recreation of the ""previously undescribed"" SARS coronavirus. (Writing in 2020, a scientist states, ""The speed of the Baric group illustrates how quickly a qualified team of virologists can create a synthetic clone from a natural virus, and therefore make genetic modifications to it. Moreover, that was back in 2003. Today, a qualified laboratory can repeat those steps in a matter of weeks."")

2005

December: Congress approves the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, which authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ""to issue a PREP Act Declaration . . . that provides immunity from liability for any loss caused, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from administration or use of countermeasures to diseases, threats, and conditions determined in the Declaration to constitute a present or credible risk of a future public health emergency.""

2009

October 7: National Institutes of Health (NIH) director Francis Collins announces a ""new phase of cooperation"" between NIH and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, including partnering for vaccine development.

October 17: Under President Obama, the NIH halts federal funding for gain-of-function (GOF) research (see Notes) and asks federally funded GOF researchers to ""agree to a voluntary moratorium."" The funding hiatus applies to 21 studies ""reasonably anticipated to confer attributes to influenza, MERS, or SARS viruses such that the virus would have enhanced pathogenicity and/or transmissibility in mammals via the respiratory route."" NIH later allows 10 of the studies to resume.

2015

2015: NIAID, under Fauci, awards a five-year, $3.7 million grant to EcoHealth Alliance (whose director gets credit on subsequent publications for ""funding acquisition"" rather than scientific work) to conduct gain-of-function studies on the ""risk of bat coronavirus emergence."" Ten percent of the award goes to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which does ""the bulk of the on-the-ground sample collection and analysis.""

September 24: UNC's Ralph Baric is granted a patent for the creation of chimeric coronavirus spike proteins.

November 9: Baric and the Wuhan Institute's Shi Zheng-Li (the leading GOF coronavirus researcher in China) publish what some refer to as ""the most famous gain-of-function virology paper"" (in Nature Medicine), describing their creation of a synthetic chimeric coronavirus. The authors state: ""[T]hese data and restrictions represent a crossroads of GOF research concerns; the potential to prepare for and mitigate future outbreaks must be weighed against the risk of creating more dangerous pathogens [emphasis added]. In developing policies moving forward, it is important to consider the value of the data generated by these studies and whether these types of chimeric virus studies warrant further investigation versus the inherent risks involved.""

2016

2016: The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity states that ""very few government-funded gain-of-function experiments [pose] a significant threat to public health.""

2017

February 8: The Modi administration in India severs ties with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, after researchers blame the Gates-funded polio vaccination campaign for almost half a million cases of childhood paralysis.

2019

2019: NIAID awards a six-year renewal grant of $3.7 million to EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan Institute of Virology to continue their gain-of-function studies on bat coronaviruses. The renewal is approved ""unusually quickly,"" receiving a ""really extremely high priority for funding.""

August 14: Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) records show that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation owns 5.3 million shares of Crown Castle International Corp., representing the Foundation's second largest tech holding after Microsoft. Crown Castle dominates ownership of 5G infrastructure throughout the U.S., including cell towers, small cell nodes and fiber.

October: A report released by NBC News in May, 2020 declares, ""The analysis of commercial telemetry data in Wuhan suggests the COVID-19 pandemic began earlier than initially reported"" and ""supports the release of COVID-19 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology."" NBC's May 8 summary states, ""there was no cellphone activity in a high-security portion of the Wuhan Institute of Virology from Oct. 7 through Oct. 24, 2019, and that there may have been a 'hazardous event' sometime between Oct. 6 and Oct. 11.""

Around the world, many people are understandably reeling in shock at the rapid economic, social and cultural changes that have followed in the wake of the phenomenon called ""COVID-19."" Many of these changes involve ever-tighter restrictions on our rights and freedoms, accompanied by inexorable messaging--both public and subliminal--that a ""vaccine for all"" and 24/7 tracking and surveillance are the only way out. Increasingly, however, there are hopeful signs that more members of the public are recognizing the duplicity and self-interest of those offering false salvation.

238,238,312,At least 19 immigrant children at Chicago detainee shelter tested positive for COVID-19,"This article is copublished with ProPublica Illinois, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.

At least 19 children and two employees at a Chicago shelter for immigrant youth have tested positive for COVID-19 in recent days, in what appears to be the largest outbreak of the virus in the country in shelters for unaccompanied minors.

According to an email sent to staff Sunday, Heartland Human Care Services officials said the first positive test results were reported at its Bronzeville shelter on Friday and that additional cases there were confirmed over the weekend.

On Monday, officials from Heartland Alliance, the umbrella nonprofit organization that oversees the shelter program, confirmed the positive tests and said they expect there will be more cases.

“We are operating under the assumption that we will see additional positive diagnoses as we receive results from the other tests that have been administered, and the steps we are taking to ensure the health and safety of our participants and staff are based on that assumption,” Mailee Garcia, a spokeswoman for the organization, wrote in a statement. “The prognosis for all of the children in our care is very good, and we are continuing to focus on our participants’ health and well-being.”

As of last Wednesday, only six COVID-19 cases had been confirmed among children and adolescents housed in shelters around the country, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees the nation’s shelter program. All six were at shelters in New York.

ORR officials said there were also 39 “self-reports” of positive COVID-19 tests among personnel affiliated with shelter programs in six states as of Wednesday. ORR has not provided updated figures, despite repeated requests since Friday.

COVID-19 is a less serious health threat to children than it is to adults.

Heartland, according to the copies of the email obtained by ProPublica Illinois, began “trying to secure tests” for children at the Bronzeville shelter after some of them displayed “COVID-19-like symptoms,” wrote David Sinski, executive director of Heartland Human Care Services.

The email doesn’t detail symptoms, when they became evident or when children were tested. But by Friday, Heartland officials learned that one of its “participants” — as the immigrant children and youth are called — had tested positive.

On Saturday, officials were told that three additional children had tested positive. By Sunday morning, they received positive COVID-19 diagnoses for an additional 15 children, bringing the total to 19. According to the email, 10 of the 19 children are asymptomatic. Two staff members have also tested positive.

“We understand that receiving this news may leave you feeling uncertain and scared,” Sinski wrote to staff. “I want you to know that we are committed to providing you with the information that you need to know in order to keep you and your loved ones healthy and safe.”

It’s unclear how old the infected children are or where they are from. But the Bronzeville shelter, a four-story converted nursing home that can hold up to 250 boys and girls, is licensed to house children from infancy to 17 years old.

Officials said they “immediately” move children to an isolated environment when they show any signs of any illness, including COVID-19, to minimize any risk of community spread. Since Saturday, Heartland has “enhanced our social distancing measures” at the shelters to limit the contact among children and between children and staff, Garcia said.

In his email, Sinski wrote that all remaining children at the facility are being tested and that he expected those results by Tuesday. He also asked all employees who worked on the floors where children who tested positive were living to stay home with pay for two weeks. Staff members who undertake “specific activities” with children will be provided N95 masks, gowns and gloves, and are being screened for COVID-19 symptoms before each shift.

Heartland officials said they are now contracting with additional nurse practitioners to be at the shelter for every shift. They are also exploring a house parent model, which would have a subset of staff be onsite full time for the coming couple of weeks, officials said.

Heartland officials said the organization is in close contact with ORR and city public health officials.

Shelters for immigrant children, nursing homes and other congregate facilities must report to the city of Chicago when there are two or more positive COVID-19 cases, according to a March order. The city’s Health Department then provides “tailored guidance to facility staff on infection control, including cleaning protocols and how to properly manage both COVID-19 positive and exposed individuals,” a spokesperson said in a statement, adding that clusters of cases have been identified in “several facilities.”

Garcia said the organization is “doing all that we can to advocate for additional testing kits for participants and staff across our programs.” She added that “our team have been stellar and courageous champions during this pandemic, committed to both a high level of quality care and being creative and supportive to each other during this challenging time. They are true heroes.”

The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, which licenses the shelters, has been notified that children at the facility tested positive. “We’ve been in contact, and we’re offering assistance,” said agency spokesman Jassen Strokosch.

Heartland officials said a professional cleaning company has performed multiple cleanings of the facility in the past week and will continue to perform weekly deep cleanings.

According to ORR guidance meant to limit the spread of COVID-19, children who have symptoms and are recommended for testing are isolated from other children pending test results. Shelter programs are required to do twice-daily temperature checks of immigrant children and alert ORR if a child has a temperature above 100 degrees. ORR has also implemented a mandatory temperature check for anyone entering a shelter, according to officials.

ORR has also stopped placing children at shelters in California, New York and Washington, with limited exceptions, and said it is trying to find local shelters for newly arrived immigrant children to limit air travel. Previously, children were moved to shelters around the country where beds were available.

About 2,800 children are being held in the nation’s shelter system. There are 69 children at three shelters run by Heartland. The organization previously operated five shelters, all in Chicago, but has consolidated the program in response to COVID-19. “Our census was lower and consolidating sites has allowed us to implement the measures . . . to safeguard the health of our staff and participants,” a spokeswoman said.

No children have tested positive for COVID-19 at another group of shelters in Illinois run by Maryville Academy, a Catholic child welfare agency, said Sister Catherine Ryan, Maryville’s executive director. About 30 teens are currently housed at two Maryville shelters.

“I’m very grateful that all of our children are fine,” Ryan said. “Obviously, we are taking a lot of precautions to keep it that way.”

Lawyers and advocates for detained immigrant children say they’ve been worried an outbreak would occur in a shelter. Lawyers went to court in late March to ask the federal government to speed up the release of children in its custody.

“It’s been our concern all along as advocates that jails, prisons, detention facilities, even licensed shelter detention, it’s where we’re going to see the massive outbreaks and it’s going to be exponentially higher than in the broader community,” said Holly Cooper, co-director of the Immigration Law Clinic at the University of California, Davis.

Cooper said she is particularly worried about children who have preexisting conditions that have not been identified by shelter officials or ORR and will make them more vulnerable to COVID-19.

“The goal,” she said, “is to get kids out of congregate care because there’s no way it can comply with [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance even if you’re using all the hand sanitizer in the world.”

724,724,883,WeWork Locations Are Essentially Unusable Now. They’re Still Charging Rent.,"WeWork is still charging its members. Reuters/Lucy Nicholson

Rebecca Shamtoob had only been working for a month at a firm based in a Manhattan WeWork before things started feeling off—well, more off than usual for the scandal-beset co-working company. It was early March, and COVID-19 cases were skyrocketing in New York City. She noticed the WeWork location was getting dirtier—particularly the bathrooms—and that there were few protective measures in place. WeWork staff were placing hand sanitizer at various places around the office, but people kept stealing the highly sought bottles, Shamtoob says. On March 12, the location threw a pizza and pie party for Pi Day (since March 14 was on a Saturday) and announced it would be the last office event for the foreseeable future. The location, at 401 Park Ave. S., planned to remain open for work, however. People were coughing and sharing food at the party, so Shamtoob decided to start working from home.

The email from WeWork came a week later: Someone at the location had tested positive for COVID-19. The last time that person had been in the office was the day of the Pi Day party.

You can understand why the co-working model would not be particularly appealing during a pandemic. But now that cases have exploded and lockdown orders across the country have prevented many people from even going in to work, many WeWork customers allege that the company has been inflexible in giving them breaks on rent and easing lease terms. WeWork is keeping its locations open, declaring itself an essential business. Yet many members feel that the offices are unusable, particularly given that nonessential workers are expected to stay home and the fact that there have been positive cases at some WeWork locations. The company has said that it is working with its 600,000 members on an individual basis to figure out compromises on rent during this time. But many members have been turning to media outlets to allege that WeWork has either offered unfair terms or completely refused to make concessions. (WeWork itself has stopped paying rent at certain locations.)

Many members have alleged that WeWork has either offered unfair terms or completely refused to make concessions.

When New York went into lockdown in late March, lawyer Stephanie Hendricks knew business for her practice would slow to a trickle. Hendricks contacted the WeWork branch at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where she’d been working since fall 2019, to see about getting a rent reduction. Instead, she says, the company shot down all her proposals, such as her suggestion that she simply pay WeWork a $600 monthly storage fee for her office supplies. (Her base rent is $1,850 per month.) Because her credit card was already on file, she had no way of stopping the payments. Getting out of the lease also isn’t an option, since she signed on for three years. At this point, she says there’s not much else she can do. “I’m honestly just taking things on a day-to-day basis,” she said. Hendricks said that when she’s gone in to check on her belongings, the workspace has been completely empty save for one staff member at the front desk. (The kitchen is no longer serving complimentary beverages.)

Jacob Feldman, CEO of the education consultancy Nexus Academics, had been on a month-to-month lease at the 300 Park Ave. WeWork location in Manhattan and was planning to move out when the pandemic hit. He told the company during the first week of March that he’d be leaving at the end of the month. WeWork told him, however, that he would’ve had to have notified them on Feb. 29 to do that—so he would have to pay through April 30.

Feldman says that getting in touch with WeWork representatives at the corporate level was impossible because by March, when New York’s coronavirus infections were rapidly climbing, they were overwhelmed with tons of other move-out requests. He asked his location’s office manager whether he could get a break on rent for April since the workspace had been closed for a combined two weeks for deep cleanings after several customers tested positive for the coronavirus. (When they did the cleanings, they would only close the floor where the infected person’s office was located, even though members are typically able to access all three floors.) The manager told him that he wouldn’t have to pay April rent, but only if he agreed to extend his lease through May. He opted to take the hit rather than extending.

Feldman recently visited the office during the workday to gather his belongings and noted that the lights were off and no other tenants were there. He saw two or three staff members who weren’t wearing masks. Some signs were up to remind people to practice social distancing, but that appeared to be the only protective measure that the location had taken.

Several members have now hired lawyers in an attempt to force WeWork to stop billing them and issue refunds for April and May. The firm Walden Macht & Haran is currently representing more than 20 small businesses located in New York, Los Angeles, and D.C. that initially found one another on social media and formed a group to protest WeWork’s practices. Lawyers on the case are also vetting 50 more from Ohio, Tennessee, and other states that have contacted the firm to join the group. The lawyers sent a letter to WeWork on Thursday threatening to pursue arbitration if its demands for rent relief and refunds are not met. It also asked the company to allow the customers to join together as a class in a potential suit; most WeWork contracts stipulate that tenants cannot join class-action lawsuits. WeWork replied to the firm’s letter asking for a list of the clients it’s representing, though the law firm wants a no-retaliation guarantee before providing it.

“For many of the clients we represent, WeWork’s monthly rent is the largest overhead they have, so forgiving rent during the pandemic while these stay-at-home orders are in place is a critical lifeline for these companies,” the law firm’s managing partner Jim Walden told Slate. “Our main goal is to convince WeWork that it should not be collecting rent from tenants in locations where people are not lawfully entitled to access the space.” Walden further noted that police have visited WeWork locations in Los Angeles and D.C. to ensure that people weren’t violating stay-at-home orders. He plans to file a letter with the New York State Attorney General’s Office and the Department of Justice alleging that WeWork is illegally ceasing retainers without a contractual basis and debiting accounts even when the company has received explicit requests not to do so. WeWork declined to comment on the legal dispute and customer complaints.

Even before the pandemic, WeWork had been trying to cut costs and shore up revenue streams wherever it could. In September, the company indefinitely postponed its initial public offering after investors brought up serious concerns about the company’s actual value and the leadership of now-former CEO Adam Neumann. From there, WeWork quickly unraveled, laying off thousands of workers in an attempt to stem its multibillion-dollar losses. Now, as the country faces an economic crisis and staying at home remains a necessity for the office workers upon whom WeWork relies, the company’s path to profitability seems even more remote. “I understand that WeWork is having its own difficulties. I’ve been rooting for them,” said Hendricks, the lawyer in Brooklyn. “I want to work with WeWork and not be treated like I have some magical ability to make money during this difficult economic time.”",1
502,502,618,Vote-by-mail debate raises fears of election disinformation,"WASHINGTON — A bitterly partisan debate unfolding on whether more Americans should cast their votes through the mail during a pandemic is provoking online disinformation and conspiracy theories that could undermine trust in the results, even if there are no major problems.

With social distancing guidelines possibly curtailing in-person voting at the polls in November, states are drawing up plans to rely more heavily on a mail-in system that has until now seen only limited use.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

Historically, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting. But social media users are already pushing grandiose theories casting doubt on the method. President Donald Trump has encouraged the skepticism, saying during a televised briefing that “a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting.” On Saturday, he tweeted: “Don’t allow RIGGED ELECTIONS!”

Justice Department officials are concerned foreign adversaries could exploit any vulnerabilities in the vote-by-mail process, especially since even minor tampering could trigger widespread doubts about the integrity of the vote.

“Is it possible, in particular for a foreign actor, to cause enough mischief in the vote-by-mail process to raise a question in the minds of Americans, particularly Americans perhaps whose candidate has lost, that somehow the result of this election is unfair?” Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the department’s top national security official, said in describing a key question confronting law enforcement.

Several disinformation experts said they have not found evidence yet that foreign actors are covertly pushing a false narrative about mail-in voting.

But a sham social media campaign that feeds existing doubts about the U.S. election process would align with the Kremlin’s playbook, said Bret Schafer, a media and digital disinformation fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a Washington think tank. During the 2016 election, Russia-linked groups polluted American voters’ social media feeds with messages about hot-button topics like race relations, gun laws and immigration.

“You don’t have to hack the vote to hack people’s perception of the vulnerability of the vote,” he said. “All you need to do is to seed enough doubt about the legitimacy of a vote.”

Well before the coronavirus upended America’s electoral process, federal officials were girding for the prospect of foreign interference in the U.S. election. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security warned in February that Russia could seek to misuse voter registration data and even secretly advise campaigns or candidates, according to documents The Associated Press obtained.

Now, a potential overhaul of how millions of Americans vote could present new vulnerabilities for foreign adversaries to weaponize.

Only five states currently conduct mail-in voting, where a ballot is automatically mailed to every eligible voter.

The remaining states have substantial work in the months ahead. They will have to make major changes to their voting and tabulating systems, buy equipment or software to track the ballots and sort out who — individual voters or taxpayers — will pay for return postage in less than six months’ time to accommodate more voting by mail.

Some states are exploring how to simply expand existing absentee voting systems, in which voters can request a ballot.

“Just like you wouldn’t want to premiere your play straight to Broadway, it’s hard to have a very new or very changed system in a high-stakes presidential election, especially under conditions where normal meetings, trainings, might be impacted by the pandemic,” said Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine.

Those last-minute changes could spur unsubstantiated claims about rampant voter fraud, an unsupported theory that Trump and some of his supporters have already pushed for years.

Russian state media have already questioned states’ attempts to postpone primaries or transition them to a mail-in process as governors grapple with how to hold an election against the backdrop of the virus.

“Coronavirus is coming, hide the ballots! Calls to cancel campaigns & voting erode already-thin trust in US primaries,” read a headline on the website of the Russian television channel RT, which broadcasts in English and is aimed at audiences outside Russia.

Meanwhile, conspiracy theories that Democrats are hyping the pandemic to push for mail-in voting or that forecasts of a second wave this fall are part of a ploy to cancel an in-person vote have received thousands of likes, retweets and shares on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. The theories are popular in dozens of Facebook groups that have been created in recent weeks to protest governors’ stay-at-home orders.

“When you have this ambiguity and uncertainty, that’s fertile ground for pushing out false information,” said Schafer, the think tank fellow. “This is creating a perfect environment for these narratives to thrive.”

Negative chatter around mail-in ballots spiked in those Facebook groups after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi proposed expanding early voting and mail-in voting last month, said Madelyn Webb, a research reporter for First Draft, an organization that tracks disinformation.

One popular meme accused Democrats of extending the quarantine to push “mail in ballots so they can cheat.” The image received a combined 90,000 likes, comments and shares, mostly on pro-Trump and conservative Facebook pages.

And for under $100, the Alaska Republican Party took out a Facebook ad that said: “Democrats are using the coronavirus pandemic to gut election fraud protections. Don’t let them. Add your name to our petition to STOP BALLOT HARVESTING!” Facebook said the ad, which is still running, does not violate its policies.

Meanwhile, liberal social media users are pushing mail-in voting as a surefire option, glossing over some of the challenges such drastic changes to the voting system will present.

Facebook groups like Occupy Democrats and Being Liberal widely circulated an article promoting vote by mail, saying it has a history of success because the U.S. military has used the method for decades.",1
604,604,738,"In emotional Mother’s Day message, health chief says more than 1,000 Illinois moms lost to COVID-19","Illinois Department of Public Health head Dr. Ngozi Ezike on Sunday delivered an emotional Mother’s Day message for her church in west suburban LaGrange — detailing that more than 1,000 mothers have died from COVID-19 in Illinois.

The weekend marked the first time in eight weeks in which Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Ezike didn’t stand before the cameras for daily COVID-19 briefings. Instead, Ezike — a mother of four — spent her Sunday delivering a lengthy sermon for Hope Church via their Facebook page.

“This Mother’s Day is especially challenging. That’s putting it ever so mildly,” Ezike said. “No one will ever forget Mother’s Day 2020.”

“Many of us can’t visit and celebrate this day in person with our mothers in the traditional way. For some, a visit would be putting our loved mother, our beloved mother, at risk of contracting this virus that we’ve all become intimately aware of,” Ezike said. “Some of our mothers are in a nursing home, where visitation is now banned, again, for their safety. Maybe your mother is no longer with us on this side of Earth.”

The state has lost 3,406 people to COVID-19, including 1,553 in the nursing homes.

“And then there are over 1,000 mothers that we have lost in Illinois alone to this awful coronavirus in just the last two months,” Ezike said.

Ezike said her spirituality helped her cope with the loss of her father, who died in February in California just before the pandemic began its rapid spread. And the health director said she’s “running on fumes with little to no sleep” and is humbled and grateful to be leading the state’s response to the virus.

Ezike heads the state’s Department of Public Health after being the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center’s medical director during 15 years working for Cook County Health. An internist and pediatrician, she oversaw medical care at the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center during the 2009 H1N1 flu virus pandemic.

“Who am I to even be here before you? A daughter of poor African immigrants, born in California, and now leading the state of Illinois through a pandemic, the likes of which we haven’t seen in 100 years,” Ezike said. “The impossible becomes possible when you see that God is in it. The fact that I’m involved in this pandemic with all my imperfections flaring and glaring is just because I am part of his perfect plan.”",1

97,97,144,"Terrence McNally, Tony Award-winning playwright, dies at 81 from coronavirus complications","fNEW YORK — Terrence McNally, one of America’s great playwrights whose prolific career included winning Tony Awards for the plays “Love! Valour! Compassion!” and “Master Class” and the musicals “Ragtime” and “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” has died of complications from the coronavirus. He was 81.

McNally died Tuesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Florida, according to representative Matt Polk. McNally was a lung cancer survivor who lived with chronic inflammatory lung disease.

His plays and musicals explored how people connect — or fail to. With wit and thoughtfulness, he tackled the strains in families, war, and relationships and probed the spark and costs of creativity. He was an openly gay writer who wrote about homophobia, love and AIDS.

“I like to work with people who are a lot more talented and smarter than me, who make fewer mistakes than I do, and who can call me out when I do something lazy,” he told LA Stage Times in 2013. “A lot of people stop learning in life, and that’s their tragedy.”

McNally’s “Lips Together, Teeth Apart,” about two married couples who spend a weekend on Fire Island, was a landmark play about AIDS. His play “The Ritz” became one of the first plays with unapologetic gay characters to reach a mainstream audience.

McNally also explored gay themes in the book for the musical “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” for which he won his first Tony Award. His play “Love! Valour! Compassion!” earned him another Tony Award for its portrayal of eight gay men facing issues of fidelity, love and happiness.

“Theater changes hearts, that secret place where we all truly live,” he said at the 2019 Tony Awards, where he accepted a lifetime achievement award. “The world needs artists more than ever to remind us what truth and beauty and kindness really are.”

F. Murray Abraham, the Oscar-winner who appeared on Broadway in “The Ritz” said of McNally: “His plays are a pleasure to do, but what he says is important, too. And he’s like a fountain he keeps on writing and writing and writing.”

Tributes pored in online from Broadway figures, including from fellow playwrights Paula Vogel, who called McNally “the soul of kindness” and Lin-Manuel Miranda, who called McNally “a giant in our world, who straddled plays and musicals deftly.” Actor Conrad Ricamora described McNally as “the most kind, brilliant person to work with” and talk show host James Corden tweeted: “He was an absolute gentleman and his commitment to the theater was unwavering. He will be missed by so many of us.”

Composer Tom Kitt, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for “Next to Normal,” told The Associated Press he considers McNally “irreplaceable.”

“Terrence was an extraordinary man and a brilliant artist,” Kitt said. “He’s a true giant in our art form, and he will be missed and we are lucky that we had him and had his art for as long as we did.”

In 2018 McNally was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He won four Tonys and an Emmy. New York University gave him an honorary doctorate in 2019.

Andrew D. Hamilton, president of New York University, told the crowd that day that McNally put a “unique stamp on American drama by probing the urgent need for connection that resonates at the core of human experience.”

Some of his Broadway musical adaptations include “The Full Monty,” adapted from the British film and scored by David Yazbek; “Catch Me if You Can,” based on the Steven Spielberg film, and scored by composer Marc Shaiman and lyricist Scott Wittman; and “Ragtime,” the musical based on the novel by E.L. Doctorow, which won four Tony Awards. In 2017, his musical reworking of the film “Anastasia” landed on Broadway.

His 2014 Broadway play “Mothers and Sons” — revisiting McNally’s 1990 TV movie “Andre’s Mother,” which won him an Emmy Award — explores the relationship between a mother and her dead son’s former gay partner. His “It’s Only a Play” was a valentine to theater-making. His “The Visit” was a meditation on revenge.

Many of his works were also presented on Chicago’s theater stages.

“Terrence McNally was a ground-breaking playwright who broke new ground with plays such as ‘The Ritz,’ ‘Kiss of the Spider Woman’ and “Lips Together, Teeth Apart, that dealt with issues in the gay community in a way few other playwrights had managed to do at that time. At the same time, he was able to create works such as the script to “Ragtime” that covered the entire panoply of an historic era. His energy and creativity will be missed, but his five decades of writing have left the world of theater a forever better place,” said First Folio artistic director David Rice.

“My heart goes out to his husband Tom at this impossible moment. Terrence was writing about being gay and the AIDS crisis at a moment in time when we desperately needed the authenticity of his voice and he opened a door for us in the hearts of audiences everywhere. We owe him an enormous debt of gratitude,” said Writers Theatre artistic director Michael Halberstam.

“Terrence McNally’s untimely passing has robbed the American theater of one of its most passionate and productive artists — and, for those of us who had the pleasure of working with and knowing him, a true friend and mentor,” said Goodman Theater artistic associate Steve Scott, who worked with McNally on the Chicago company’s world premiere of “The Visit” and various other projects. “Terrence was equally at home in the worlds of stage drama, comedy, musical theater and opera ... but his most notable (and heartfelt) accomplishment was a series of plays which gave voice to the gay community and its members, chronicling its emergence from the shadows in the 1970s, encapsulating the tragedies and triumphs of the AIDS pandemic, and leading the way to 21st century social revolution and acceptance.”

McNally was born in St. Petersburg, Florida, and grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas, listening to radio broadcasts of “The Green Hornet” and the Metropolitan Opera. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia University in 1960 with a degree in English.

McNally was at the Actors Studio when he was hired by novelist John Steinbeck to be a tutor and guardian to his sons. One of McNally’s earliest theater attempts was writing the book for a musical adaptation of Steinbeck’s “East of Eden” which was called “Here’s Where I Belong” and lasted only a single performance on Broadway in 1968.

McNally’s first Broadway play “And Things That Go Bump in the Night” didn’t fare much better in 1965. His absurdist, symbolic melodrama about good and evil confounded critics. Newsday called it “ugly, perverted, tasteless.” It closed in less than three weeks. He was 24.

He rebounded with the 1969 off-Broadway hit “Next,” a two-character comedy about a reluctant draftee reporting for an Army physical. A string of successes followed, including “Where Has Tommy Flowers Gone?” (1971), “The Tubs” (1974), “Bad Habits” (1974) and “The Ritz” (1975), a farce set in a gay bathhouse that ran more than a year on Broadway and became McNally’s first produced screenplay.

His breakout, “Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,” about a romance between a waitress and short order cook, was later adapted into a film starring Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer. It was revived on Broadway in 2019 starring Audra McDonald. Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre company staged a critically acclaimed version in 2004, starring Laurie Metcalf and Yasen Peyankov.

He collaborated three times with legendary composer John Kander and lyricist Freb Ebb — on “The Rink,” “Kiss of the Spider Woman” and “The Visit.” Chita Rivera starred in all three.

His love of opera informed his works “Golden Age,” “The Lisbon Traviata” and “Master Class,” which explored the life of opera diva Maria Callas. He also contributed to opera as a librettist — “The Food of Love” in 1999 with music by Robert Beaser, “Dead Man Walking” in 2000 with music by Jake Heggie, and 2015’s “Great Scott” with Heggie.

McNally sometimes was controversial, especially with his play “Corpus Christi,” which depicts a modern-day Jesus as a homosexual. The Manhattan Theater Club, the first company to consider staging it, received death threats and temporarily canceled the production before enjoying a successful run.

When picking up his “Ragtime” Tony Award, McNally thanked the theater community for its outcry. “You came together when I was in trouble. It was a time of oppression. You came together overnight. Our voices were heard, and we won.” Holding his Tony high, he said, “So this is for freedom. Thank you.”

“Terrence McNally has been and will always be a beacon in our theater and the LGBTQIA+ communities,” said Chay Yew, artistic director of Chicago’s Victory Gardens Theater. “His body of work has shone an immense light on our lives, allowing us and others to see ourselves, with humor, with heart, with humanity, especially when we needed it most during the AIDS epidemic. I know I did. He will always live on in many of artists and people he has inspired.”

McNally and his partner, Thomas Kirdahy, married in Vermont in 2003, and again in Washington, D.C., in 2010.

879,879,1052,"ICE is seeking to deport these migrant girls during the pandemic, alarming advocates","The scramble began on May 6: Two sisters from El Salvador, ages 8 and 11, in U.S. government custody had just been approved for reunification with their Houston-based mom, when ICE stepped in and moved to deport them.

That same day, in McAllen, Texas, a teenage girl from Guatemala completed a sworn asylum declaration, claiming she would be persecuted because of her race, indigenous identity and refusal to join a gang if returned to her home country. Hours later, ICE picked her up.

The sisters and the teenage girl have three things in common. They all previously sought asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border alongside parents. They were sent to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP, program. And they reentered the U.S. a second time — without their parents.

Minors are not supposed to be returned to Mexico under MPP if unaccompanied by their parents or legal guardians, so some families have allowed their children to seek asylum in the U.S. alone. Between October 2019 and this month, at least 577 unaccompanied migrant children in the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, or ORR, have reported having their parents in Mexico, according to the agency.

Under a landmark court settlement, the U.S. government is obligated to make ""prompt and continuous efforts"" to unite unaccompanied migrant children with relatives or other sponsors in the U.S. while their immigration cases proceed.

But the government argues that children who have already been ordered removed with their families under the Remain in Mexico policy should be deported — even if they last entered the U.S. unaccompanied. Attorneys for the minors, however, say they should be treated like other unaccompanied migrant children.

Both the sisters and the teen girl have been fighting their case in court. A federal judge barred the government from immediately deporting the Salvadoran sisters, and they were released to their mother in Houston, according to attorneys. Their deportation proceedings are ongoing. Their father, with whom they were originally sent to Mexico, remains in Matamoros, Mexico.

The Guatemalan teen was transported by the government first to a motel in McAllen, then moved to another one in Alexandria, Louisiana, according to her attorneys. ICE was prepared to deport her on a flight Friday afternoon, according to Neha Desai, a lawyer who is part of the team representing all children in U.S. immigration custody. But her flight was postponed to Monday after the Guatemalan government said it would not receive the plane because of coronavirus cases among migrants recently deported by the U.S.

Judge Dolly Gee of the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles ruled on April 24 that deportation orders under the Remain in Mexico program do not change the government's obligation to seek the prompt release of migrant children to relatives and other sponsors in the U.S. under the landmark 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement.

""That policy just like any other pending proceedings or participation in class action proceedings or anything like that, if it results in a prolonged detention where deportation is not imminent, then it is causing unnecessary delay,"" Gee said during a hearing before issuing her order, which said the administration's ""opaque policies"" surrounding children with pending MPP cases violate the Flores settlement.

Advocates say ICE has seized on Gee's use of the word ""imminent"" to move to deport children in ORR care who have pending removal orders under the Remain in Mexico policy.

ICE said migrant children are only deported when ""their immigration case is complete and there are no legal impediments to removal.""

""If a minor received a final order of removal from an immigration judge as part of a family unit enrolled in the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) — prior to entering the U.S. as (an unaccompanied migrant child) — then they are subject to the final order of removal,"" an ICE spokeswoman said in a statement Friday.

The agency did not comment on specific cases or say how deporting migrant children from shelters overseen by the U.S. government conforms with the adjusted ""enforcement posture"" it announced in March as a result of the pandemic. In its announcement, ICE said its agents would only focus on detaining ""public safety risks,"" as well as immigrants whose criminal records require the agency to apprehend them. For everyone else, the agency said it would ""delay enforcement actions"" until the crisis abated.

Mark Weber, a spokesman for ORR, said his office does not determine which children in its custody are deported, calling it a child welfare agency.

Desai said she is concerned that the government's actions are related to Gee's decision that children who were previously returned to Mexico and came back unaccompanied should be released to sponsors.

""We can't concretely say it's retaliation, but it sure feels like it,"" Desai said, adding that she believed the government had intensified attempts to deport these children after Gee's ruling was made.

Asra Syed, who represents the sisters in Houston, said that in addition to being so near to their mother, there were no relatives in El Salvador who the children could be safely returned to. A redacted filing reviewed by CBS News included descriptions of abuse and gang threats during the girls' youth.

""Our clients are the only detained children we know of who ICE is insisting on deporting even though: 1) they have a parent in the U.S. who ORR recommends they be reunified with, 2) they have no parent or other relative in their home country who can take care of them, and 3) they are really, really young — only 8 and 11,"" Syed said.

ORR currently has roughly 1,600 migrant children in its custody, a low population level not seen since 2011. The agency has been receiving few minors since late March from border officials, who are expelling most unauthorized migrants, including unaccompanied children, under an emergency public health order.",1
548,548,670,"Pritzker urged to let restaurants open June 1 — but at 25% capacity, with employee safeguards","Gov. J.B. Pritzker was urged Thursday to relax his five-step plan to re-open Illinois — by allowing restaurants to open at 25% capacity on June 1 with strict safeguards for their employees.

Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia said without changes, Pritzker’s plan would have a devastating impact on restaurants and bars because it would force them to wait until June 28 at the earliest to re-open to dine-in customers.

Instead, Toia proposed restaurants be allowed to move to Phase 3 on June 1 and relax restrictions every 14 days, instead of waiting 28 days between phases.

“We would have a lot of restrictions. Personal protective equipment. Face coverings. Social distancing. Taking the temperature of employees when they come in to work,” Toia said.

“June 1 is still three weeks away. ... Indiana, Texas, Arizona, Georgia and Tennessee are open. Let’s see if they have a spike. If they do, OK. If they don’t, I would really urge the governor to look at letting us re-open with 25% or less capacity, then use the 14-day model and, hopefully, by mid-June be at 50% capacity.”

Toia acknowledged restaurants operate on razor-thin margins and “economic models don’t work on 25% capacity.”

But, with restaurants literally fighting for survival, he’s willing to take what he can get.

“If we wait until the end of June, it will be 16 weeks that 50% or more of the restaurants in the city of Chicago have been closed and [the other] 50% are 80% down in sales. I don’t think there is any economic model out there that says you can stay in business” in that situation, Toia said.

“The further we go, the harder it is gonna be for restaurants to re-open. The National Restaurant Association is predicting that 20% of the restaurants won’t re-open. That’s basically looking at the end of May. If we go `til the end of June, it could be 45% or more of restaurants that never re-open. And restaurants are the soul of every neighborhood in Chicago,” Toia said.

“The governor understands the desire to open up sectors of our economy as quickly as possible because he shares that same sense of urgency,” said Jordan Abudayyeh, Pritzker’s press secretary. But, she added, “the state’s five-phase plan was put together by health experts and lays groundwork for how we move forward with a new normal. From day one, the governor has relied on science and data to drive the response to this deadly virus and staying on this course will continue to save lives.”

The governor’s plan has been criticized for being too conservative, moving too slowly between phases and setting too many hurdles to get there.

Although he divided the state into four regions, each authorized to re-open on its own timeline — based on positive test results, hospital admissions for COVID-19 symptoms and ICU beds and ventilators — no region could move to the next phase without waiting 28 days.

And none could return to normal until there is either a vaccine for the coronavirus or widely available treatment. That means no gatherings larger than 50. No conventions at McCormick Place. No major festivals like Lollapalooza and Taste of Chicago. And no major sporting events with fans in attendance.

Schools, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and gyms would have to wait until Phase 4 — June 28 at the earliest — to open, and even then would have strict limits on capacity.

Business groups and their allies in the Illinois General Assembly are concerned that, by the time various regions meet those hurdles, scores of businesses already will close for good, taking thousands of jobs with them.

That’s Toia’s argument in a nutshell.

“Governor Cuomo has been at the forefront just as much as Governor Pritzker has. But why is New York using a 14-day period to move between phases and we’re using a 28-day period?” he said.

But how willing will customers be to return to restaurant dining?

“If we’re only opening with 25% or less capacity, I think people will come. I don’t think everybody will run out. But enough people will. … It’s all about cash-flow,” Toia said.

A mayoral appointee to the Zoning Board of Appeals, Toia said he has talked to Mayor Lori Lightfoot “and her team” about his plan.

“The mayor wants to see what the governor is gonna do. But the mayor is trying to be very progressive with us. There’s communication going on about maybe closing some streets for outside dining with the tables on the street. That way, we could have social distancing,” Toia said.

“There’s no question that she wants to think outside the box about how we help these restaurants throughout our 77 communities stay viable as we move ahead.”",1

Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin has contracted coronavirus infection. The head of the Russian government has temporarily resigned.

Mishustin, who was diagnosed with Covid-19, suggested appointing first Vice Prime Minister Andrey Belousov acting head of the Russian government. President Putin supported the initiative and promised to sign the adequate decree today, April 30.

Mikhail Mishustin will spend the next two weeks in self-isolation.

""I have just discovered that I was tested positive for coronavirus. In this connection, as well as in accordance with requirements of Rospotrebnadzor, I must observe self-isolation regime. This is absolutely necessary in order to protect my colleagues,"" said Mishustin, addressing Putin via video conference.

The Prime Minister assured that the government would continue working as usual.

""What is happening to you now can happen to anyone,"" Putin said, thanking Mishustina for his work. The president also promised that he would continue to consult Mishustin in making decisions on issues that they had previously discussed.

In turn, Mishustin appealed to Russian citizens with a request to act as responsibly as possible during the May holidays.

1015,1015,1211,The remote-work boom born from the COVID-19 lockdown has prompted some tech workers to reconsider living in the Bay Area. The region's rivals see it as a growth opportunity.,"San Francisco Bay Area.

Coronavirus is prompting some tech workers to consider leaving the Bay Area.

They're betting that permanent work-from-home policies will become more and more popular — lessening the troubled region's allure.

Some realtors in other smaller cities across the Western US say they've seen an uptick in interest from Bay Area residents looking to decamp.

And regional organisations and preparing to launch programs to attract remote workers to their states.

Coronavirus has some tech workers reconsidering their commitment to the San Francisco Bay Area.

The region's high cost of living, traffic, and housing crisis have long been pain points for professionals in the technology industry headquartered there — but now offices closures and work-from-home policies are prompting a renewed questioning of whether it's still worth it.

With companies like Twitter announcing that it will allow employees to work remotely even after pandemic lockdowns lift for good, some industry-watchers are predicting the city will rapidly lose its luster as workers decamp for more appealing locales.

In conversations with Business Insider, realtors in smaller cities say they're seeing increased interest from potential Bay Area buyers, regional development groups are scrambling to put out the welcome mats for remote workers, and investors are said to be looking to capitalize on the trend.

Balaji Srinivasan, a Silicon Valley investor and entrepreneur, predicted on Twitter that the lockdown and new work-from-home policies are removing some of the few incentives left for people to stay in the Bay Area. ""The office isn't used, the industry is going remote. So SF is just pure repulsion. And people will fly away,"" he wrote.

The prohibitive cost of living in the Bay Area and lack of housing stock has already forced many — particularly younger generations — to consider relocating in recent years, said Skylar Olsen, senior principal economist at real estate listing firm Zillow. If permanent work-from-home policies become more and more prevalent post-lockdown, that may well accelerate the trend.

The multimillion-dollar question is whether that will translate into workers moving out to the suburbs, or going further afield.

Even if they can work remotely, workers are still likely to favour metropolitan areas with access to creature comforts over more far-flung locales: think a condo in downtown Bozeman, Montana rather than a cabin in the depths of Kootenai National Forest. ""Our value we place on amenity-rich, walkable neighborhoods is still really high,"" she said, and that's unlikely to change after the lockdown lifts.

Real estate listing site Realtor.com said they saw a surge in people Bay Area looking for listings elsewhere as lockdowns came into affect. ""The Bay Area's balance of within-metro and outbound home searches tipped substantially toward outbound starting in mid-March,"" spokesperson Cody Horvat said. ""The share of traffic from the Bay Area looking outside of the area jumped up 3.4 percent in April compared to the same period last year, marking the largest jump in outbound traffic share so far in 2020.""

That surge has since subsided, and the areas that saw the most interest from Bay Area users were Los Angeles and Riverside in California, Las Vegas, Houston and Chicago.

It's hard to quantify any potential lockdown-influenced increase in sales this early, with deals typically taking a month or more to close. But Tony Levison, a realtor in picturesque Bend, Oregon, said he's seen an uptick recently in interest from Bay Area buyers.

""It's a direct flight to most of the major cities on the West Coast ... you can get anywhere pretty fast, and you don't have ot deal with the city lifestyle any more. Lots of outdoor activities, smaller town, and for a lot of people in the major cities, it's a lot more affordable, too.""

In Bozeman, Montana, Noel Seeburg, a realtor with Bozeman Real Estate Group, also said he's seen some increased interest — in particular from investors looking to buy up properties to rent to workers who might be relocate.

In Nevada — home to beautiful Lake Tahoe and bustling Reno — the government-backed Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada (EDAWN) is actively developing a new program in response to coronavirus to try and attract new remote workers to the state, Mike Kazmierski, the organization's CEO said, to be rolled out after the lockdowns lift.

""There's no need for that workforce, regardless of the lockdown, to be stuck with high prices, traffic, all those other issues ... associated with California, when they can do the exact same job 30 minutes away from a ski slope.""

That said, there's at least one group predictably confident that the Bay Area won't lose its allure any time soon: San Francisco realtors.

Mariana Pappalardo, a realtor with Sotheby's, said she's seen some uptick in interest in people looking to get out of the city (one client is ""more motivated than ever to get out of here and move to Tahoe"") but predicted that work from home won't become the norm.

""Eventually, people are going to want to see people in the office,"" she said. ""I think this trend of working remotely is going to be popular for a year, tops, and then the shareholders are gonna want to see some faces.""

Plus, she added, San Francisco's incredibly dense network of talent will long continue to be a major draw.

""We have such a strong population ... nine out of ten of my clients have a PhD, where else do you get that? Those people are going to move to Montana and be bored out of their minds.""

958,958,1151,I sent masks to health workers but the Trump administration seized them instead of helping,"Bob Bland

Opinion contributor

One month ago, as COVID-19 spread across the county and critical personal protective equipment like masks, gloves, surgical gowns and face shields continued to be in short supply, I had hoped the government would do its job and act to meet this demand. But when news outlets reported that medical workers were being left vulnerable to infection without PPE, it was clear we couldn't wait for the Trump administration any longer.

A small group of volunteers came together to found Masks for America and teamed up with leading health care activist Ady Barkan's Be A Hero Fund, Social Security Works and National Nurses United to get our front-line heroes the equipment they needed to stay safe as they saved lives.

As the federal government failed to provide essential equipment, our small group of volunteers has successfully delivered nearly 200,000 FDA-certified, CDC-approved KN95 masks to front-line workers in hard hit areas — New York City, Detroit, New Orleans, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico — in just a matter of weeks. But it wasn’t easy, because when the federal government finally decided to act, it wasn’t the way we had expected. Instead of helping us, they seized some of our PPE shipments without telling us where they were taking them.

Unprecedented federal interference

On April 11, during the peak of COVID-19 cases and deaths in New York City, the Federal Emergency Management Agency intervened and demanded orders of medical equipment allocated to our relief efforts be redirected to the federal government. FEMA then seized 50,000 N95 respirators we had ordered without giving us an explanation or telling us where those respirators were going.

In my 15 years of working in the manufacturing industry with international and domestic supply chains, I have never — never — had the federal government interfere like this.

It wasn’t long before I realized it wasn’t only happening in New York and New Jersey. FEMA confiscated San Francisco’s PPE order as it went through customs, even as the Trump administration told states and cities to procure their own equipment rather than rely on the federal government. Since those reports of FEMA quietly seizing materials, at least six states have lodged similar complaints against the federal government interfering with their supply chains.

Over 100 health leaders to governors:Require masks to help contain COVID-19

It is not illegal for the government to seize and distribute medical shipments through the Defense Production Act, yet our government has failed to be transparent with the public about how and why it is redistributing the resources of cities, states and private organizations like ours.

The struggle to secure PPE and medical supplies isn’t just a failure of leadership in our government but also an unsustainable supply chain issue that has been bubbling just under the surface for years.

Bring manufacturing back to America

Over the past two decades, I’ve fought as our nation offshored millions of American manufacturing jobs overseas. Most PPE and other medical equipment is now made in China, which has led to increased difficulty for the government to produce and distribute crucial resources during a disaster. This, in addition to FEMA’s track record of inefficiency and failure to provide adequate disaster relief, has led to the government’s shortage and is likely why officials are taking equipment from a small volunteer-driven coalition that was able to leverage its resources and know-how to do the job they couldn’t do.

HOTLINE:Share your coronavirus story

International production lines are taking weeks to deliver the resources we need to keep people alive. If we were manufacturing PPE and medical supplies in the United States, it would take mere days to deliver protection to front-line essential workers where it’s needed. Reshoring the production of PPE and other essential public health resources permanently could also bring millions of good manufacturing jobs home, at a time when more than 36 million Americans have filed for unemployment.

As we approach 1.5 million confirmed U.S. cases of COVID-19 and 89,000 deaths, with thousands more projected daily, it’s clearer than ever that we as a nation will need to hold our government accountable for the series of systemic failures that led us to the point of FEMA seizing PPE from nurses, state governments and nonprofit relief efforts without explanation or transparency.

Epidemiologist Q&A:‘We're just in the second inning of a nine-inning game’

While there is much to learn from this ongoing pandemic, one thing is clear — for our nation's public health and national security, Congress must take immediate action to reshore PPE and medical supply production lines back into the United States. Otherwise, we’ll continue to be vulnerable, doomed to repeat the deadly missteps of this pandemic.

Editor, Health Impact News

Dr. Andrew Kaufman may be the most censored doctor in the U.S. right now. His videos are removed and censored from YouTube very quickly.

Dr. Kaufman is so intelligent, and so articulate, that the “mainstream” media and medical authorities obviously fear him and his message, and they are doing everything in their power to suppress him.

This video (below) he did with Spiro Skouras, for example, was immediately removed from YouTube, although Spiro’s other videos remain for the most part (for now).

Andrew Kaufman is a medical doctor. Here is his full bio from his website:

Andy Kaufman, M.D. is a natural healing consultant, inventor, public speaker, forensic psychiatrist, and expert witness. He completed his psychiatric training at Duke University Medical Center after graduating from the Medical University of South Carolina, and has a B.S. from M.I.T. in Molecular Biology. He has conducted and published original research and lectured, supervised, and mentored medical students, residents, and fellows in all psychiatric specialties. He has been qualified as an expert witness in local, state, and federal courts. He has held leadership positions in academic medicine and professional organizations. He ran a start-up company to develop a medical device he invented and patented. Faculty Positions Clinical Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, SUNY Upstate Medical University

In this interview with Spiro Skouras, you will most likely learn things you have never heard before about the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Kaufman will explain why this is all planned, and is not really about a dangerous virus at all, but a way to control people’s lives.

He will explain things about the new type of vaccine they are rushing so fast to develop, and what he believes is the real objective for this vaccine.

Dr. Kaufman has already paid a steep price to be a whistle blower, and he only expects it to get worse. He states:

This is the only important thing for me to do now, is to get this information out, so that we can prevent ourselves from living in a horrible, horrible future. I have two young children, and they are my main motivating factor, that I don’t want them to live in a world where they have no freedom. And that’s where we’re heading right now. And so whatever risks there are, they’re risks that I simply have to take. That’s why I am doing what I am doing. There have been things that have occurred. I have had consequences. I was let go from my regular psychiatry job because I refused to wear a mask. I have had several friends who are doctors or other health care professionals who have been very upset with me. (They’re) disappointed and won’t talk to me anymore. I knew that those risks were part of this. But that’s not what’s important. I’ll tell you that I would be happy to risk being taken to jail as well, because I’m not going to participate in any of these measures. I don’t wear a mask. I don’t stay at home. I respect other people’s rights to make their own choices. So I don’t go and get in people’s faces. But if anyone is willing to make eye contact and interact with me, I don’t observe any social distancing, (and so) any opportunity to hug someone, especially in public, I always take advantage of that, because I want to show people that actually all of these measures are really voluntary. Even Governor Cuomo has made a public statement that there’s nothing that they can do to enforce any of these measures and that they are voluntary. And I would like to encourage other people to make that decision, because if we rely on the authority to give us approval of how to exercise our freedom, they’re going to take more freedoms away, as they’ve been doing. So while I respect people that to go and protest at the City Hall or State Capital, they are coming from the right point of view, they’re just asking the authority figures, the government, to give them permission, when they don’t need permission from the government. They already have permission because they have inalienable rights. It’s not really a decision for me. It’s just what I feel that I have to do to preserve the way of life that I want to live for me and my children.

71,71,112,NYC mayor asks Elon Musk to manufacture ventilators for COVID-19 patients,"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk tweeted on Wednesday night that he’s willing to have his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, make crucial ventilators to help patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to take him up on that offer.

De Blasio tweeted at Musk on Thursday morning, saying New York City “will need thousands [of ventilators] over the next few weeks,” despite already acquiring them “as fast as we can.” The mayor said his team would reach out to Musk directly. “We could use your help!” he wrote. (After this article was published, Musk responded: “Sounds good, we will connect with your team to understand potential needs.)

“We could use your help!”

Musk had tweeted that he’d have his teams make ventilators “if there’s a shortage,” and by all accounts, there will be. The only reason it might not seem like there isn’t one currently in the US is that we haven’t yet exhausted the short supply. And while President Trump said he’s willing to invoke the wartime “Defense Production Act” on Wednesday to address the shortage, he tweeted later in the day that he’d only do so in a “worst case scenario.”

@elonmusk New York City is buying!



Our country is facing a drastic shortage and we need ventilators ASAP — we will need thousands in this city over the next few weeks. We’re getting them as fast as we can but we could use your help!



We’re reaching out to you directly. — Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) March 19, 2020

Musk isn’t the first to propose using his company’s manufacturing facilities to make critical equipment. Just yesterday, General Motors said CEO Mary Barra told the White House she was looking into making ventilators at her company’s factories. Ford followed suit soon after. Musk is alone among those peers in underplaying the pandemic, though. He called the “panic” over the coronavirus “dumb,” compared the lethality of COVID-19 to car crashes (which are not contagious), and finished his Twitter conversation about ventilators on Wednesday night by again saying he thinks the “panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn’t happened already.”

As for how Musk might approach making ventilators, the entrepreneur said they are “not difficult” to make. He pointed to how Tesla makes “cars with sophisticated hvac systems,” and SpaceX “makes spacecraft with life support systems,” though he admitted it would take some time to spin up any real production effort. Where they would be built is another question; Tesla is currently locked in a back-and-forth with local authorities in the San Francisco Bay Area over whether the company should suspend production of electric cars amid a shelter-in-place order, and it could run into a similar issue at its Gigafactory in Nevada now that the state has issued a similar directive.

President Trump’s gutting of critical government offices, combined with his apparent refusal to take the threat of the novel coronavirus seriously in the early weeks, has left states and local governments overwhelmed in the fight against the pandemic. At the same time, Trump’s administration has leaned hard on the private sector to pick up the slack in ways that have repeatedly surprised those companies. He claimed Google was developing a nationwide screening website that will help people learn if and how they should get tested for COVID-19 and said retail companies would offer up parking lot space for testing sites — despite neither of those claims having been completely true before they were uttered aloud.

Still, companies are putting themselves into the mix. Amazon announced it will hire 100,000 workers worldwide and is bumping up its hourly pay to both help with a delivery crunch and provide jobs for people who are now out of work. Gaming company Razer has said it will help make masks, too.

Musk is no stranger to inserting himself into an international crisis. He famously spun up an effort at SpaceX in 2018 to create a submersible vessel to help rescue the soccer team trapped in a cave network in Thailand. If Musk really wants to help out this time around, it looks like he already has one taker in New York City. It almost certainly won’t be the last, either.

1045,1045,1241,Stuck at Home With My 20-Year-Old Daughter,"But none of that masks the reality that Kate’s world has shrunk to the size of her bedroom. In a flash, the daily life of the confident, privileged young woman who’d thrived at school, haunted Broadway stage doors, mastered the New York subway, and, yes, discreetly flashed a fake ID in the bars of Morningside Heights was upended indefinitely. She and the rest of us—my wife, Dee Dee; Kate’s 16-year-old brother, Stephen; and I—have been adjusting ever since. I sat down the other day with the thoughtful, articulate 20-year-old daughter I first held when she was barely more than 20 inches long to ask what she—and, by extension, her college generation—is making of this moment.

“One of the hardest things has been going—and for better or worse—going from being independent to suddenly living in my childhood bedroom again,” Kate told me. “I would go to the dining hall or I would cook for myself, but I would be on my own to secure three meals a day. And I would do my own laundry—and wouldn’t have to do other people’s laundry!” (We’ve all taken strict lessons in sorting darks and lights—and folding—from Dee Dee, whose standards are the crisp ones of the Navy pilot’s daughter she is.) The monotony of quarantine is real, and wearying. “Partly it’s not being able to see anybody who’s not in my immediate family. You know, we all have lunch together, the four of us, almost every day, and that’s totally different from anything that would have happened at school, and it’s never even happened since I was maybe 5 years old and on summer break.”

When Kate first left for college two years ago, I’d pause in mourning every time I passed the open door of that empty bedroom. Now the door is closed, and I have to remember to tread lightly and walk on by. It’s weird for both of us. “I love you guys,” Kate said, “but sometimes I’ll be writing a paper and one of you barges in to ask for help with so-and-so, and I don’t have a space like the library to go and sit and work, just have a little more privacy. I have my own bedroom, which is really great and lucky, but if I come out of my bedroom, then suddenly it’s like I’m fair game to be engaged in conversation.”

Read: Gavin Newsom’s nation-state

One of Kate’s first acts upon returning home was to post a brightly lettered sign on the bedroom door, listing her daily class schedule, with the injunction: “Please knock/text.” Since she’s not only taking online classes, but is 3,000 miles and three time zones away from her teachers, a schedule that she’d deliberately designed to require no commitments before 11 a.m. is now radically different on the West Coast. She’s double-majoring in theater and history, and just stage-managed a student play on Facebook Live. But she’s far away from all her friends.

“Do you miss your friends?” I asked.

“What do you mean ‘Do I miss my friends?’!” she rejoined. “I think everyone misses human interaction that’s not with the people you’ve been stuck with for going on two months … I just miss having people who are going through what I’m going through. We’re all going through the same thing, but one of the hardest things for the transition has been that I’m the one who’s coming back. Everyone else in my house—you three lived here. What don’t I miss about my friends?”",1
415,415,512,"Art Institute Lions, Picasso statue in Daley Plaza sporting face masks","Walk past the iconic lion statues at the majestic entrance to the Art Institute of Chicago on Michigan Avenue and the message roars out loud and clear: If you’re in Illinois, you have to wear a mask or face covering in public starting Friday.

The large-scale public gesture is an homage to Mayor Lightfoot’s rallying cry earlier this month promoting her “Chicago Together! Make a Mask, Give a Mask, Wear a Mask” initiative. The mayor is asking residents to make/donate homemade cloth masks for first responders and Chicago’s homeless/shelter populations. A cloth-masked Lightfoot herself is pictured on the video screens at the Crown Fountain in Millennium Park.

In Daley Plaza, the equally iconic Picasso statue is also sporting a mask. The massive coverings for the lions and the Picasso feature a Chicago flag and were created by Dimension Design in Glenview.

Related Face mask stolen from Art Institute Lion

According to a statement from the Art Institute, the materials used in the creation of the masks did not in any way impact those needed to produce PPE supplies for first responders and frontline workers.

The masks, made from a printable synthetic material, were designed by Kelly Winter of Dimension Design, and took several days from plan to completion, said the company’s co-founder Jeremy Biewer. A team of 10 employees worked on the project — from graphic design, to fabric engineering, to printing, cutting and sewing.

“The fabric can hold up pretty well in Chicago weather,” Biewer said. But if there’s any [wear and tear] in the coming weeks, he said they can “produce replacements in a matter of hours if necessary.”

Biewer said his company generally works trade shows and large-scale events, but has reconfigured to create masks for first responders and frontline workers during the pandemic. To date, they’ve donated 3,000 masks to local facilities.

The lion masks were made for a “very modest three-figure charge for material and labor,” said Jim Winter, executive vice-president of Dimension Design, while the mask adorning the Picasso statue was “donation from the company to the city and people of Chicago.”",1
295,295,376,Another 59 people die of COVID-19 in Illinois; hospitalizations remain flat during outbreak,"Illinois health officials on Monday said another 59 people have died from the coronavirus, while the state’s hospitalization levels remain relatively flat.

There are also 1,151 new cases, bringing the state’s total to 31,508 positive cases. The state has lost 1,349 people to the outbreak, and the virus is now in 95 of the state’s 102 counties, officials said. There were 5,040 tests conducted on Sunday, although private labs have not been reporting results on Sundays.

The percentage of ICU beds in Illinois used by COVID-19 patients has remained steady at 40%, and the percentage of ventilators being used by those patients is actually declining slightly, now standing at 23%, Pritzker said.

At his daily briefing, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker warned case numbers are rising — but at a slower rate.

“Our curve is bending the right way,” Pritzker said. “With the current mitigation strategies in place, we may not have reached out peak yet, but your actions are helping to keep that peak as low as possible.”

He added that without the drastic mitigation efforts that have been implemented, “we would have required thousands more ventilators beyond our initial capacity.”

Pritzker said the state hasn’t “quite hit the peak yet.”

“And you won’t really know if you’ve hit the peak until you start to go down,” the governor said.

According to Pritzker’s office, 757 patients were on ventilators as of midnight on Sunday. On Saturday, there were 749 ventilators being used; on Friday, there were 738.

In total, there are 1,239 COVID-19 ICU patients in Illinois hospitals, up slightly from Friday, when 1,192 coronavirus patients were hospitalized in the ICU, his office said. There were 4,599 COVID-19 patients in total in hospitals on Sunday, up from 4,340 on Friday.

After two days of a record high 125 deaths last week, the state reported 33 deaths Sunday.

Illinois residents are abiding by a stay-at-home executive order that expires on April 30. But an extension is anticipated. Pritzker on Friday ordered all Illinois schools closed to in-person learning for the remainder of the school year.

Pritzker has remained tight-lipped about an extension, just as he was before announcing the first executive order.

“A lot of this has to do with looking at every aspect of the order and seeing all of the things that we might change,” Pritzker said. “We’re looking at it, working on it every day. I promise you that I will be out here and tell you as soon as I can.”

The governor was also asked if the state might re-open region by region. He signaled that is a possibility.

“I absolutely think that we need to look at where the capacity exists. For example if the hospital capacity in a certain area is quite large and very available, even with coronavirus in existence, then that might be a place where you could do more than some other place. What’s most important, though, is keeping people safe and healthy,” Pritzker said, adding social distancing is a very different concept for those in rural areas than those “on the North Side or the West Side of Chicago.”

Pritzker said he is speaking with medical experts “and we’re trying to follow that advice and look at how best to give people the most freedom, while also making sure people are healthy.”

The governor also said some of the federal guidelines for re-opening the country “are worth looking at,” including the notion that getting past the peak equates to 14 days of numbers going down.

Pritzker offered other hospitalization numbers at the daily briefing, as well. The state on Sunday released data showing 1,860 residents and staff members at state long-term care facilities have tested positive for COVID-19, and 286 of them have died.

Long-term care facilities in Cook County have by far seen the largest number of cases and deaths. The data show 804 people related to Cook County nursing homes have tested positive for the coronavirus, with 146 of them succumbing to the disease.

Pritzker outlined some state procedures for COVID-19 cases in nursing homes, including treating any symptomatic residents or staff as confirmed cases, if there is already a confirmed case at the home. He said nursing home workers “are considered healthcare workers” and have access to testing at the state’s drive-thru sites and other hospital locations that prioritize first responders.

The governor said the state is also working on testing all residents and staff at nursing homes.

“We’re prioritizing testing at long-term care facilities that are home to our populations where a COVID infection is more likely to lead to higher-severity cases, especially among black and brown communities,” Pritzker said. “This testing at non-COVID facilities will allow us to identify early the presence of COVID-19 in a facility and isolate those cases before widespread transmission.”

The state is working with the Illinois National Guard and the Illinois Department of Transportation to ramp up testing at the state’s nursing homes.",1
775,775,944,"Pastors say churches offer ‘balm’ to the suffering, want more people allowed in the pews","Invoking the supremacy of God’s law and making a comparison to the evils of communism, a group of Illinois pastors — led by former mayoral candidate Willie Wilson — called Thursday for a loosening of statewide restrictions on church gatherings.

“All of these restrictions, they sound more like communism,” said Florin Cimpean, senior pastor at Philadelphia Romanian Church of God in the Ravenswood neighborhood, one of several dozen religious leaders who gathered Thursday outside the Thompson Center to take issue with Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order.

But Cimpean, who said he grew up in Soviet-controlled Romania, added: “Not even communists were able to completely shut down churches. We are essential. The spiritual, emotional and mental impact of this [coronavirus] will probably be greater long-term than the medical one.”

Cimpean said his church held services last week with about 40 people in attendance and plans to do so again this weekend — a violation of Pritzker’s order, which allows for a maximum religious gathering of 10 people, regardless of place of worship’s size.

The gathering Thursday came on the heels of a victory a day earlier for Pritzker, whose order survived a religious challenge in federal court from a pair of churches that sought to hold worship services with strict social-distancing guidelines in place.

The pastors gathered at the Thompson Center say the 10-person limit is arbitrary and doesn’t take into account the size of churches — some of which have large sanctuaries and could, they say, safely handle more parishioners.

Pastor Charles Mironas of Hope Community Bible Church in Park Ridge echoed the sentiments of his fellow religious leaders when he described the church as “essential.”

“If ever the world needed a church, it’s now,” Mironas said. “We are a balm of healing to the community. People need to know there is hope, need to know that there are answers.”

The pastors say they weren’t given a voice — weren’t invited to the table — before Pritzker issued his order.

Wilson, who organized the event, said the order doesn’t recognize that many in poorer communities might not have the option to shift services online, as has become common in more affluent North Side communities.

“You have a lot of homes in the poor communities that don’t even have Wi-Fi,” Wilson said. “They don’t have the technology. They can’t afford it.”

Mayor Lori Lightfoot has said she has no interest in having noncomplying parishioners or pastors arrested, but has also said she’ll do what needs to be done to make sure the rules are followed.

Asked if he’s concerned that violating the stay-at-home order might lead to an arrest, Cimpean said: “I don’t think the mayor will do that. But if they want to do that, let them come. It is what it is.”",1
74,74,115,Bandsintown adds live stream concert alerts as more musicians head online,"As more musicians kick off online concerts amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, Bandsintown is launching a new feature to support them. The concert notification service can now push out a “watch live” notification when musicians are live-streaming shows. These notifications will appear on Bandsintown, along with Facebook pages, Instagram Stories, and other places that surface Bandsintown listings.

Twitch is increasingly becoming a popular place for indie musicians to make money amid the pandemic. With touring essentially at a standstill, many are looking to online platforms in order to try and recoup lost funds from shows.

Additionally, Bandsintown has launched its own Twitch channel, with all proceeds going to the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund. The first show features South African DJ Black Coffee and will stream at 1PM ET today.

Bandsintown says it’s starting the channel both to connect artists with fans while many are stuck at home and to help raise more funds for MusiCares through Twitch. There are a bunch of ways to financially support streamers on Twitch, as longtime Twitch user Ducky told The Verge yesterday. Users can subscribe to channels or tip small amounts, and Amazon Prime members are able to subscribe to one channel per month for free.

“As true music fans, there are ways you can help us help artists,” reads Bandsintown’s announcement. “If you’re able to, avoid asking for refunds, buy their merch, attend their live shows when they return, donate to tips jars, or donate to MusiCares.”

MusiCares is an arm of the Recording Academy that provides financial relief to those in the music industry facing unexpected hardships. (Disclosure: I’m the vice president of the Chicago chapter of the Recording Academy.) With many musicians currently unable to tour and out of work, the organization recently launched a separate fund specifically for artists and other industry professionals affected by the pandemic.

Bandsintown says its next live stream is scheduled for next week, and it will be a multiday live music marathon featuring both emerging and established artists.",1
658,658,798,What Will Air Travel Look Like After the Pandemic?,"Grounded planes at Brisbane Airport on April 21 in Brisbane, Australia Jono Searle/Getty Images

America is grounded on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. Photos of thousands of airliners crammed onto unused runways and any available tarmac space take place in our national lockdown’s gallery of eerie images. Domestic passenger traffic numbers are down about 95 percent from a year earlier. Airlines have canceled most flights as they lose tens of millions of dollars a day, and there is little indication that demand for air travel will pick up anytime soon. The federal government did step in to provide the industry with $25 billion in emergency grants and loans to preserve the nation’s circulatory system and prevent a total collapse—aid conditioned upon the airlines continuing to serve all their domestic markets and avoiding any layoffs until September.

Against this backdrop, Future Tense editorial director Andrés Martinez invited three aviation experts to talk on Slack about when, and how, Americans might take flight again. Seth Kaplan is the transportation analyst for NPR’s Here & Now, the author of Glory Lost and Found: How Delta Climbed From Despair to Dominance in the Post-9/11 Era , and co-host of the Airlines Confidential podcast.* Benét Wilson is the credit card editor for the Points Guy. She’s a veteran aviation journalist who has written for such publications as USA Today and Aviation Daily and is known among her peers as the aviation queen. Christopher Schaberg is the Dorothy Harrell Brown distinguished professor of English at Loyola University–New Orleans and the author of The End of Airports.

On May 21 at 4 p.m. Eastern, Future Tense will host an online event asking, “Will We Ever Fly Again?” RSVP now.

Andrés Martinez: Seth, let me start with you on an, um, easy question: When do you think we will get back to 2019 levels (or those of January, for that matter, when we saw a 5 percent increase in passenger traffic of air travel)?

Seth Kaplan: We’ve never seen anything like this. In fact, not only is this worse than each of the prior crises (9/11, SARS, the Great Recession, etc.)—it’s worse than all of them combined. The answer to when we will return to something resembling normal really depends on the course of the pandemic itself, when there will be a vaccine, etc. If you could tell me the answer to that, I could tell you what will happen with aviation. But it’s difficult to imagine a nearly normal year before 2022, if not 2023.

Benét Wilson: Another big thing is airlines winning the trust of travelers by ensuring that planes are clean enough and there are enough proper social distancing protocols in place, from the time people enter the airport to the time they’re on board in their seats. That’s going to be a challenge.

Christopher Schaberg: Yes, Benét has hit on a key issue: There’s public health, and then there’s personal risk. Both of these collide intensely at airports and on airplanes.

Andrés: In recent years, we all entered into a pact with airlines: Cram however many of us as you need to onto the back of those planes to keep fares low. That’s been the basis of the democratization of flight (though we still complain about being crammed in). Benét, is the current crisis going to result in the end of that bargain? Do you think we are going to see flying again become an elite pursuit, with lowest fares to fly across the country starting at a couple grand to accommodate social distancing concerns? Or will all this pass?

Benét: I’m old enough to have flown regularly on airlines in the pre-deregulation age. My father was an Air Force officer, and we traveled the world back then, when air travel was mostly for the rich. I can envision a scenario where fares will go up, making air travel less accessible. Airlines need to keep butts in seats and their balance books in the black. Frontier had to walk back charging travelers for an empty middle seat. But when you squeeze, that toothpaste is coming out, one way or another.

Andrés: Chris, you recently wrote a moving ode to empty airports. We always assumed there was an inevitability about the continued expansion of travel and shrinking of the world. But did your ruminations about empty airports make you—should they make us—question those assumptions?

Christopher: The unknowns right now are so wildly beyond anyone’s calculations or control. It’s hard to say. But we are now realizing just how much faith we had—for so long!—in the “ongoingness” of air travel basically as a static enterprise. Now we’re suddenly faced with a wide range of possibilities, from back to the status quo on the one side to a near-total wind-down of commercial flight on the other. And it really seems like anything in between could occur.

I think we may have reached—or even crossed—a threshold of growth that is (and has been, frankly) unsustainable. For several decades it seemed like unlimited growth was entirely possible and inevitable (speaking of commercial flight specifically, here), and now we’re having to reassess the assumptions that made such growth believable and possible. It’s hard for me to see how we’ll simply return to the level of flights from a few months ago—and keep growing—because COVID-19 has given a jolt to the system—a jolt that is also connected (if not directly) to broader environmental issues surrounding flight, which are not going away but are only foregrounded now with cleaner and quieter skies, etc.

Andrés: True, flight shaming due to climate was starting to be a bit of a thing pre-pandemic, especially in Europe. Seth, do you think airlines have been worried about this environmental concern as a long-term threat to their business?

Seth: It had certainly moved from the back of their minds to the forefront. An existential threat? I don’t think most of them considered it that. But a long-term threat to one degree or another? Absolutely. Until Greta Thunberg’s journey, I don’t think very many people viewed global travel by air as anything other than aspirational—a force for good. If it’s becoming socially unacceptable among any meaningful number of people—something to be ashamed of—that’s unhelpful for airlines. It’s a question of degree, and I think the best bet now is a measurable but not overwhelming avoidance of flying by some people.

Christopher: It seems like we’ve kind of moved from flight shame to flight fear, but these two things might become increasingly conflated—and equally existentially dangerous for airlines.

Benét: Last week I drove from Baltimore to my family home in San Antonio. I dropped off the car at San Antonio International Airport and looked at everything with the coronavirus lens. Will I use those water bottle fill stations? How will we social distance at TSA checkpoints? How will bins and checkpoint areas be cleaned? How will eateries and retail handle passengers? So many questions that need to be answered.

Andrés: You brought up the Frontier Airlines episode from this week. They wanted to charge passengers $39 to block middle seats; there was an outcry; they backtracked. That reminded me of an interesting story Richard Aboulafia wrote for Future Tense on how the industry has always had an unwritten rule that thou shalt not compete on safety grounds. But in a pandemic environment, it’s going to be hard to distinguish between marketing for comfort and for safety. Is that business class pod just a way to get a nice sleep on your way to London or a means of preserving your life?

Benét: I’m looking at that JetBlue Mint seat with the door I flew on in a whole new light. Same with other airlines that have pods. I feel sorry for the airlines having to walk that fine line between comfort and safety. I fear there will be a few more stumbles of this sort before we settle into a new normal.

Seth: What’s interesting is that a few airlines around the world have, for several years, allowed customers to bid to be seated next to any empty seats, and of course there was no outcry when it was only a question of comfort, not hoping to avoid a deadly virus. Now, granted, the middle seat on Frontier is only 18 inches wide, not 6 feet, so it’s reasonable to say it’s selling only a false sense of security, not true security, anyway. But to Aboulafia’s point, if it had already been offering to block middle seats for $39 prior to all this, that would be different. To the larger point: Decades ago, if you asked fliers what they cared about when they chose an airline, they would mention safety alongside price and schedule. In recent years, they wouldn’t, not because they didn’t care about safety but because they took for granted that all airlines were basically quite safe. Now we see airlines sort of competing, however cordially, for which one provides the most social distance in an environment not designed for social distancing. At some point, maybe after there’s a vaccine, that will start to fade again as a marketing tool, so to speak, but just the fact that we’re there, however temporarily it might be, is remarkable.

Andrés: Beyond the issue of fares needing to match supply and demand, which we alluded to above, do you guys think this crisis will accelerate other trends we were already seeing in aviation?

Seth: I think consolidation is somewhat back in play, because regulators are more likely to approve a merger or acquisition if companies can argue that absent it, one company (if not both) would go out of business anyway. U.S. airlines couldn’t, with a straight face, in recent years, claim to face any existential threats. Now they can. I’m not saying it’s going to happen, but it’s more likely because of that.

Christopher: It seems like one thing we could see (this is a bit dystopian, perhaps), is a stark two-cabin model where $$$ first-class seats have even more space between them, and then in back (after a severe dividing wall) there are the standing chairs (remember those?) for steerage. This probably won’t happen, but I’ll bet at least one airline is looking into it.

Benét: I remember how airlines pulled back on free meals after 9/11, going toward a buy- on-board model. We’re already seeing airlines taking away that option, along with alcohol too.

Seth: Yes, I think we can forget about some of the modest amenities U.S. airlines have restored in economy in recent years. The stroopwafels might have gone away on health grounds (to minimize nonessential interactions between flight attendants and customers), but I don’t think they’ll come back the moment it’s safe. These airlines are back to trying to get through the day, focusing on needs and not wants.

Andrés: I do miss those stroopwafels, United’s great innovation of the past decade.

Christopher: I too remember after 9/11 when all that free food went away. I was working at an airport at the time and used to live on all the extra boxed meals we’d unload at the end of the day. Then, suddenly, they were just gone.

Andrés: To Seth’s earlier point, we take for granted now how safe flying really has been. … We can reasonably assume planes don’t fall out of the air. But occasionally other concerns pop up, such as terrorism post- 9/11, which led to the creation of TSA, the end of being able to meet loved ones at gates, the ritual of taking off shoes and dispensing with liquids at security. Now our safety concerns are shifting and I see TSA relaxing liquids rules and allowing expired driver’s licenses to go through! (Imagine that on 9/12!)

Christopher: I know, all those new 12-ounce bottles of hand sanitizer let through! Really?!?

Seth: Every crisis changes the industry, so it’s reasonable to think the biggest crisis will change the industry in big ways. But typically, there’s an (understandably) big reaction to a crisis, and then things get ratcheted back. Flying became a lot more of a hassle after 9/11, but eventually we got PreCheck and so forth.

Christopher: Or it’s possible that all the empty planes flying overhead right now will be seen as the most ridiculous last grasp at keeping this enterprise called commercial flight alive.

Andrés: So I want to pin you guys down a bit more. It’s 2030 … what is it like to fly? Don’t answer, “It depends on the pandemic.”

Benét: I must resist the temptation to predict we’ll all be in those flying cars we’ve been waiting for since the 1950s …

Seth: I’ll start with an easy one: We are all becoming permanently more germophobic, and we will forever see some number of people, even if just a few, wearing masks on flights—including just domestic flights in the U.S.—even after there’s a vaccine and there’s no specific, immediate threat.

Christopher: I have a hope: that in 2030 commercial flight takes place at a fraction of what 2019’s levels were and people understand that flying is for special, “essential” travel. And airlines have adjusted and contracted to meet this demand. But the more cynical side of me thinks that in 2030 it will look a lot like 2019 but even worse, and yet climate change and other environmental disasters will be making life harder for those living in the poorest nations and hardest parts of the world.

Andrés: You don’t believe it’s beneficial travel has become more accessible and commonplace in recent years?

Christopher: The accessibility of flight was beneficial, to a point—but then it metastasized so quickly.

Andrés: The real explosion in traffic has been overseas, with the rise of the global middle class. Isn’t it hard to tell people elsewhere they can’t enjoy our way of life because they are late to the party?

Christopher: It is a real tension, for sure. But the “party” metaphor is apt: The party can only go on for so long before everyone is throwing up.

Seth: This is why many people feel a true global price on carbon, which includes aviation, is the way forward. The idea is, you let people make their own choices, but pricing in the impact of those choices.

Benét: I see a global contraction, with a governmental organization overseeing the airline industry as the Civil [Aeronautics] Board once did.

It will regulate fleets and schedules, eliminating competition. Fares will be higher, and not everyone will be able to afford to fly. But it will insulate the industry from future chaos, where Sir Richard Branson is offering Necker Island as collateral to save Virgin Atlantic and the Italian government has swooped in to nationalize Alitalia.

Seth: I hesitate to disagree with the Aviation Queen (being that I’m not even a prince), but I expect more incremental change than what Benét said.

Andrés: Seth, if you have enough frequent flyer points, we can upgrade you to Aviation Czar.

Benét: It’s all good. I was looking way into the future—and who will check me in 2030?

Seth: Absent some big, unimaginable, external force—which we’ve all seen is a dangerous game to play, to try to ignore that!—I think we know a lot of what will happen, because airports and airplanes are designed with such longtime horizons. We know, more or less, what kinds of airplanes airlines will be flying in 2030, and they’re not so different from the ones they’re flying today. They’ll be more carbon-friendly—that’s good—but if their efficiency means less money spent on fuel, the benefits of that could flow more to consumers than to the environment (if flying continues becoming cheaper and thus more people do it). The pace of “densification,” as airlines call it— ramming more seats on planes—will actually slow, even absent any COVID-related sensitivities, because many airlines are up against the regulatory limits of how many seats you can put on an airplane.

Andrés: It’s so interesting … to think about the clamor for de-densification that will be such a staple of life, right? On planes, and elsewhere.

Seth: Definitely.

Andrés: I mean, no offense, but I don’t want to get on an elevator with any of you.

Seth: A full dance floor used to be the sign of a great party! What are weddings going to look like now? And so forth.

Christopher: Yes, we are completely reorienting our senses of space: personal space, social space, and psychic space. And airports and airplanes are places where senses of space are felt (and monetized) intensely. There’s no marketing scheme or loyalty campaign that can really mitigate this reality. And regardless of our personal decisions, when it comes to risk, we are going to see a lot of professions reining in travel—if not directly for safety reasons, for cost-saving reasons. Because they now realize they can. People are used to Zoom and all the other telecommuting technologies.

Andrés: Benét, you may be the “Aviation Queen,” but you have a broad view of the travel ecosystem beyond airlines. Do you see demand for travel going down because of factors other than flying … such as what might happen with hotels and credit cards, and attractions like Disney World?

Benét: I just published a story on the Points Guy about my stay in a hotel last week. Think about all the surfaces and that the coronavirus can last five-plus days on. Housekeepers will have to be retrained. Rooms will take longer to clean. Rates will go up—and that’s even if you can convince guests that you’re cleaning properly. We’re already seeing credit cards—especially travel-branded ones—being forced to offer credits and allowing more points or miles per dollar spent on categories such as dining and groceries.

Andrés: Before we finish here I’d like each of you to tell me: When are you next getting on a plane, and why?

Christopher: I have no plans to fly right now. I hope to travel in the fall or spring to give a university talk that got canceled at the end of March. But that’s my only real idea or tentative plan, at this point. I’m certainly not going to rush it.

Seth: I haven’t been on a flight since January and have no current plans, other than a flight I booked for October because it was practically free (figuring I can take it or not, depending on the situation). I do hope to fly before then—just no specific plans, as I wait to see when it seems safe. The first place my family and I will go will certainly be Florida, to see our families whom we didn’t get to see over Passover (when we last planned to visit them).

Benét: I’m the Aviation Queen—and I drove from Baltimore to San Antonio, so that tells you something. I love to travel, but I don’t see myself getting on a plane before November. I’m a germophobe. (I’ve always traveled with Clorox wipes and hand sanitizer.)

Andrés: Thanks to you all. This has been fun, if sobering. I hope to meet all of you in person sometime soon—just not in a middle seat next to me.

947,947,1128,How McDonald’s dine-in experience will change due to coronavirus,"As more businesses slowly reopen during the coronavirus pandemic, it’s clear the customer and employee experience will be vastly different.

Fast food giant McDonald’s says it will introduce several new safety standards once dine-in rooms reopen to protect customers and workers from the spread of the virus.

The restaurant said it will close some seating and tables to encourage social distancing, and require employees to wear masks and gloves. When eating inside one of McDonald’s restaurants, employees will deliver food to a customer’s table in a double-folded bag.

McDonald’s said it will also clean restaurants more frequently. Play Places will remain closed and restaurants will modify “dine-in beverage procedures” to limit contact. Restaurants will also include signs to advise customers on proper social distancing.

“As our daily routines continue to evolve, we remain committed to safely serving you and our local neighborhoods around the country,” said McDonald’s USA president Joe Erlinger in a statement. ”We look forward to welcoming you back into our dining rooms, when the timing is right and with these extra precautions in place.”

The company said the new procedures will apply to all 14,000 McDonald’s locations in the U.S.

As states across the country begin to lift restrictions implemented to slow the spread of coronavirus, businesses are weighing the best approaches to safely reopen. Many businesses have instituted new procedures such as frequent cleanings and personal protective equipment for employees.",1
1218,1219,1573,Italian support for Fiat-Chrysler sparks political clash,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1
126,126,177,"Undocumented immigrants face coronavirus, looming jobs crisis with no real safety net","Hector and Sandra are scared. He’s diabetic and she has rheumatoid arthritis, putting them at higher risk of getting sick and dying from the coronavirus.

But since they’re undocumented, they have to keep working — no matter what.

“If we don’t work, we can’t survive. It’s just that simple,” Sandra said.

Hector and Sandra are pushing 50 and have lived in Chicago for nearly 20 years. Both of them work at a warehouse packaging Windex, Clorox disinfecting wipes and other cleaning supplies.

“They’re really busy right now,” Sandra said.

On March 11, the day the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic over the coronavirus, a worker near Sandra on the crowded warehouse assembly line started coughing.

“That worried me,” Sandra said. The rheumatoid arthritis weakens her immune system, she said, “and I already know to stay away from people who feel sick.”

Fearing the worst, she called off work the next week, but her husband still clocked in. The couple makes about $800 a week after taxes, just enough to cover the basics, including the $1,200 monthly rent for the two-bedroom apartment they share with their 13-year-old son.

“We both have to work to make it,” Sandra said. “I’m worried about my health, but what can I do?”

(The Sun-Times agreed not to use the last names of undocumented people quoted in this story.)

One day without work becomes a crisis

There are around 400,000 undocumented immigrants in Illinois. None of them can claim unemployment insurance even if, like Hector and Sandra, they’ve paid into the system for years.

Tax-paying undocumented immigrants were also excluded from receiving $1,200 checks from the federal government in the $2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress on Friday. Those checks are reserved for qualified workers with Social Security numbers.

Nearly half of undocumented are uninsured, according to a recent analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care think-tank. That means there’s a high chance many of them who feel sick are still going to work, said Jorge Mujica, an immigrant and labor rights organizer with Arise Chicago.

“There’s no real safety net for undocumented immigrants, not even during a pandemic,” Mujica said. “Most undocumented immigrants don’t have paid time off or sick leave. If they’re sent home, they’re left without an income at all. One day without work for them becomes a crisis.”

Many undocumented immigrants have seen their jobs evaporate in recent weeks.

Maria, 48, worked for nine years as a housekeeper at a downtown hotel before she was fired March 18 along with 20 of her coworkers, most of whom are also undocumented.

“I asked why they were firing us instead of laying us off, but they said they couldn’t give us any more information,” she said.

Maria had health insurance through her housekeeping job, which also covered her three sons and her husband, who works construction. “We all depended on that health insurance,” she said. “Now what are we supposed to do?”

To keep calm, Maria tries to stay off Facebook and watches the news only once a day. But without a job and unsure if she’ll get help from the government, she’s having a hard time keeping her head up.

“It’s really depressing. I want to work, and now I can’t,” she said. “I wasn’t worried that much about the virus. I always took care of myself and bought disinfectant and cleaning supplies. I taught my kids how to wash their hands all the time. But not having a job makes it a lot harder not to panic.”

‘I’m their safety net right now’

As undocumented immigrants feel the pinch, their children are stepping up to keep their households afloat.

Martha Diaz is one of an estimated 35,000 young people in Illinois who have temporary legal status through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The 22-year-old works full time as a digital marketing strategist for an auto parts company in Broadview. She’s also a full-time student in her final year at Dominican University.

Diaz’s classes and her job have moved online, meaning she spends all of her time at her South Side home that she shares with her three siblings and their parents, both of whom are undocumented.

“My dad’s having trouble finding work,” she said. “My mom works with elderly clients as a home health aide but last week they told her not to go in anymore because of the coronavirus.”

“It feels like I’m their safety net right now,” Diaz said. “My parents always told us to save money, so I have some in the bank. But I don’t know if my company will start having to lay off people because there’s no income coming in. I guess we’ll see.”

787,787,956,Pritzker apologizes for saying MLB players shouldn’t bargain,"Gov. J.B. Pritzker apologized for criticizing baseball players for bargaining over their salaries during talks with management on how to get the coronavirus-delayed season under way.

Pritzker faulted players on Tuesday, saying “I realize that the players have the right to haggle over their salaries” but adding “I’m disappointed in many ways that players are holding out for these very, very high salaries and payments during a time when I think everybody is sacrificing.”

At his briefing on Wednesday, he said “I want to address something that I said yesterday, regarding baseball and baseball players.”

“I want to apologize for leaving the impression that baseball players shouldn’t have the right to bargain, to protect their health and safety,” Pritzker said. “I absolutely support that right, and I should have made that more clear.”

Players agreed in March to accept prorated shares of salaries during a shortened season as part of a deal that guaranteed them service time if no games are played.

Owners on Monday approved a proposal for an 82-game season. Concerned about losing money if games are played without fans, owners approved asking players to base their salaries on a 50-50 split of revenue. Players say that amounts to a salary cap and they will never agree to that framework.

584,584,714,Rebuilding Bronzeville: Black Chicago’s post-COVID-19 future starts on south lakefront,"Developer Phil Beckham is on a mission to rebuild Bronzeville, the heart of Chicago’s African American communities.

“The pandemic has uncovered some ugly truths about the lack of access to good healthcare and affordable housing in the black community,” says Beckham, who’s lived in Bronzeville on and off for 55 years. “I’ve always focused on providing what’s needed in my neighborhood. A lot of people have moved away. My goal is to bring them back.”

That’s Leon Walker’s aim, too.

“We want to encourage others who grew up in these communities, like I did, to invest in the neighborhood,” says Walker, another South Side developer. “Now is the time to return home.“

A growing consensus among Chicago developers and planners seems to be that concentrated, block-by-block redevelopment is the surest way to bring in the people and businesses needed to strengthen the city’s black communities, which have disproportionately borne the brunt of COVID-19.

Beckham’s current project is 43 Green, a mixed-use development centered around the 43rd Street CTA Green Line stop being done as a joint venture with the Habitat Company,. The first phase of the project, to be built on a city-owned lot, calls for an eight-story building with 91 apartments — half affordable housing, half market rate — built over ground-floor shops.

If that goes well, Beckham plans two other buildings nearby. A townhouse development by another builder recently was completed across the street.

“It’s all about density,” Beckham says. “That’s a major part of keeping retail strong.”

A good retail mix will attract new residents.

“A lot of young professionals live elsewhere in Chicago because they can’t find the amenities they want in Bronzeville,” Beckham says. “Our focus is to add some spark and bring in new faces and energy.”

City Hall seems to have come to the same realization. Mayor Lori Lightfoot has created the INVEST South/West program to catalyze redevelopment of commercial corridors in 10 neighborhoods on the South Side and West Side. Unlike previous, scattershot efforts, the idea is to focus economic development efforts in selected areas, signaling to private business interests that these are good places to invest.

“Revitalization strategies work best when you get synergy,” says Maurice Cox, the city’s commissioner of planning and development. “You have to create an ecosystem, with one investment next to another. That generates momentum and encourages others to join you.”

The most promising of the 10 targeted communities is greater Bronzeville, from Lake Michigan to the Dan Ryan Expressway and 26th Street to 51st Street. The area has many strengths, including a committed middle-class base. What it doesn’t have is a thriving commercial district.

It needs one to improve the quality of life for current residents and to help the neighborhood — and ultimately the whole South Side — attract newcomers.

Bringing in new people is essential. The 2020 census is likely to show that Chicago lost more than 135,000 black residents over the past decade, offsetting population gains by other groups. That’s on top of a decline of 181,000 black people in the 2010 census.

It’s not enough to just stop those losses. Lightfoot says she wants to boost Chicago’s population to 3 million — 300,000 more than now.

To do that, the city needs to draw people from elsewhere. Looking to the past as a guide, it will largely be college graduates who decide to make Chicago their new home. The percentage of Chicagoans with college degrees has grown from 17% in 1980 to almost 40% now. But most of those college grads weren’t born in Chicago. According to census data, 56% weren’t even born in Illinois.

Of the Illinois college grads, a reasonable assumption is that the number from Chicago reflects the city’s share of the state’s population. That means 90% of college grads now living in Chicago — the chief drivers of the city’s resurgence — were born elsewhere.

The challenge is to make the South Side as attractive as other parts of the city to college grads.

It can be done. At a time when Chicago’s African American communities are beset by violent crime and plunging population, the number of black Chicagoans with college degrees is going up, not down. Since 2010, the number of black college grads in the city has increased by about 15,000, or 15%, vs. 27% growth for the city overall. Still, this shows the potential is there.

Neighborhoods all over the South Side and West Side need commercial revitalization. Bronzeville — because of its lakefront location relatively near downtown — is the most important.

In 1980, Chicago’s college grads were mostly clustered in a narrow band along the lakefront. The revitalized area — a collection of neighborhoods with high education and middle income or better — pushed inland from there and now takes in much of the North Side and Northwest Side.

On the south lakefront, progress has been more uneven. Still, with only a couple of gaps, neighborhoods with a high proportion of college grads now extend all the way down to Woodlawn.

If the North Side pattern repeats, once revitalization is firmly established in Bronzeville, it will gradually spread to other parts of the South Side.

A critical step is establishing a lively business district — the equivalent of the Clark Street/Broadway corridor on the North Side.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Broadway was the heart of what was then called New Town. It was — and is — busy and walkable, with lots of shops and people. College grads who moved to Chicago in that era — like me — typically spent at least a few years living in the vicinity. It was their port of entry into Chicago, their first taste of big-city life.

Bronzeville needs a bustling corridor like that if it’s to be a point of entry for college grads moving to the South Side. Now, it has a path to getting one.

Neighborhood redevelopment isn’t the only thing that needs to happen to rebuild the South Side. College grads don’t come to Chicago just because it’s fun. They’re also looking for jobs and opportunity.

Among U.S. metro areas with the most African American residents, the one having the highest percentage of black college grads is Washington, D.C., with 35% — higher than the national average. The reason is the federal government is based there, with its pick of the nation’s top talent.

Chicago doesn’t have that kind of hiring power, but it does have an expanding downtown economy, which could absorb a lot of black college grads.

“There’s a lot of things moving and growing here,” Beckham says. “I’m really happy to be a part of revitalizing my community.”",1
371,371,463,"How to clean, reuse or hack a coronavirus mask","The CDC recommends wearing a face mask that covers your nose and mouth when leaving your home for essentials like groceries and prescriptions. Some types of masks are not intended for reuse, but there are a few things you can do to sanitize them, upgrade filtration and extend their lives. Here are some strategies that will help you get the most out of your mask, and keep you and your family safe.

Let's say you just got back from the grocery store wearing your mask. Now what?

1. Treat your mask like a biohazard.

Isolate it from the rest of your family. “You don't want to be leaving it on the kitchen counter or the coffee table where other people may inadvertently be handling it,” says Kirsten Koehler, an associate professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

2. Wash your hands with soap every time you remove or even touch the mask.

Act as if the virus is on both sides of the fabric. Make sure to wash your hands properly for at least 20 seconds.

Those are coronavirus mask basics.

There’s much more to know, though, if you want to extend the life of your gear or even make your own mask.

How to clean homemade cloth face masks and the best material to make one

To clean your mask, run it through the washing machine and dryer after use. The water doesn't necessarily needs to be hot but make sure to use a laundry detergent.

If you don't have access to a washing machine, you can hand-wash using soap. Another option: Put the mask into a paper bag and leave it in a warm place for at least two days. After that, the virus will become inactive and won’t be infectious.

When you are wearing a homemade mask, you should keep in mind that you are not wearing the mask to protect yourself, but to minimize the spread of virus particles to others. Even if you feel no effects, you may be asymptomatic.

Homemade masks are less effective at protecting the wearer because most have voids, or spaces near your nose and cheeks where the tiny droplets can be inhaled, and the pores in the fabric alone are generally not small enough to trap tiny aerosolized droplets.

Some materials make better masks than than others. According to a study published in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness, homemade masks made from a kitchen towel proved to be the most effective at removing particles.

On the other hand, T-shirts or pillowcases may be the best choice as they can provide a better fit by stretching. Avoid using old fabrics because washing and drying may stretch the pores, allowing more particles to get in.

The choice of fabric is very important. Professor Koehler suggests using tightly woven fabric folded in multiple layers. A research paper published in PeerJ confirms the fabric concern. The study looked at the surface of 20 different types of cloth masks and found the size of pores in masks ranged from 80 to 500 micrometers. For comparison, the novel coronavirus is about 0.12 micrometers:

You may also want to avoid thick materials like vacuum cleaner bags. A material with high resistance will force air to escape through routes around the mask fabric creating a void. Also, breathing through a thick mask can be tough on your heart and lungs. This could put elderly people and those with preexisting cardiopulmonary conditions at risk.

""It shouldn't be so difficult that you just can't physically breathe, but you should notice some resistance in your breathing,"" Dr. Koehler said. ""Otherwise your mask is probably not doing anything.""

Adding any sort of filtering inside the mask may help to reinforce it and add additional protection. An engineer specializing in aerodynamics has tested the effectiveness of paper towels. A single layer captured 23% of particles 0.3 microns or larger. Adding an extra layer increased particle capture to 33%.

Phillip Clapp, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma, and Lung Biology at the University of North Carolina, has been testing various homemade masks. When he studied three layers of cotton fabric, he saw that the material itself had efficiency of around 90%. However, once he wore the mask made from that material, its efficiency dropped below 50%.

""And what that tells us is that it really has to do with how well that mask will fit your face, as to how well you'll be protected,"" Dr. Clapp said.

The mask should cover both your nose and mouth. The CDC has published several tutorials on making face masks, which include masks with elastic ear loops as well as tie strings. If you choose to make a mask with tie strings, it's important to make sure the straps fit correctly around the head so the mask does not fall down.

When wearing a mask, secure the bottom ties first with a bow around the nape of your neck. Then, pull the mask by the upper ties over your mouth and chin and secure around your head.

Preliminary results from a study by researchers at Northeastern University show that sewn fabric masks can in some cases approach the filtration efficiency of commercially produced masks.

Adding an elastic outer layer improved fit for all mask types tested. Particularly helpful was adding an outer layer made from nylon stockings. Even surgical masks were found to perform better with stockings during the study.

You should not clean an N95 mask at home. But you can reuse it with proper care. Here's how:

The general public is asked not to purchase N95 respirators due to shortages in the medical supply. But if you have one, they offer good protection. The key with the N95 respirator is proper fit: There should be no air gaps or voids around the nose, cheeks or chin.

According to Koehler, some data suggests that the virus could live on N95 respirators up to seven days, as opposed to about two days for the cloth fabrics.

She recommends using a method that isolates the mask in a breathable location:

Never use cleaning products such as Lysol, alcohol or bleach. Liquid, including soap and water, can damage the mesh of electrically charged fibers designed to catch particles and droplets.

Can you use expired face masks and respirators?

Expired N95 respirators remain as effective as the new ones, Clapp said. He tested respirators that were as far as 11 years behind the expiration date. While the respirator may still filter particles as good as new, elastic bands that may deteriorate.

Can you clean and reuse disposable surgical masks? Sort of. Here's how:

Surgical masks are intended to protect the wearer’s face from large droplets and splashes of blood and other body fluids. Efficiency of surgical mask filters can range from less than 10% to nearly 90% depending on the manufacturer and the type of the mask. According to Clapp, surgical masks with ear loops (38.9% effective) performed worse than surgical masks with tie strings (71.5% effective.)

Generally, surgical masks are less effective than N95 respirators because they don’t provide a seal around the nose and mouth, which could allow smaller droplets to get in. At the same time, studies show that they are better than homemade masks at protecting from larger particles.

Ana Rule, an assistant professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, recommends not buying surgical masks to ensure enough supply for health care workers. Wear one only if you have it already at home.

How to reuse: The best strategy is to isolate it for a week in a breathable container such as a paper bag. Putting masks in the plastic may lead to accumulation of moisture and development of bacteria. Surgical masks should not be washed, because liquid damages the filter.

How to clean and reuse elastomeric respirators

When elastomeric respirators are properly fit tested and worn, they can provide the user with an effective face seal and will hold up to repeated use, cleaning and maintenance. As with N95 masks, use only if you already have one.

How to clean and reuse the respirator: Wipe down with alcohol swabs to disinfection after each use. The attached filter cartridges are replaceable and are easily changed. Though they can be reused, their life span depends on many factors such as exposure and concentration of particles. It's important to double check if the cartridges you have are designated for filtering coronavirus particles.

Using masks in the family

The best practice is just for one person within a family to go to a store or other places where it might be difficult to maintain social distancing. Parents should ensure that children don't touch their face, because wearing the mask may encourage them to do so. CDC recommends that children under 2 years old shouldn't wear the mask because of the risk of suffocation.",1
344,344,434,Massive asteroid flying past Earth next week looks like it's wearing a face mask,"If you're planning to visit Earth in the year 2020, it's important to be wearing a face mask to protect yourself from the coronavirus. And apparently the rule doesn't only apply to humans — an asteroid speeding toward Earth appears to know about the pandemic and is sporting a face mask of its own.

An asteroid called 52768 (1998 OR2) will zoom past Earth next week. Astronomers at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico are tracking the asteroid, and couldn't help but notice a familiar silhouette after capturing a new radar view of the object.

""The small-scale topographic features such as hills and ridges on one end of asteroid 1998 OR2 are fascinating scientifically,"" research scientist Anne Virkki said in a press release Thursday. ""But since we are all thinking about COVID-19 these features make it look like 1998 OR2 remembered to wear a mask.""

A team at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico took this range-Doppler radar image of Asteroid 1998OR2 on April 17. University of Florida

But don't worry — the asteroid has no chance of becoming infected with the virus.

Arecibo data confirmed that 1998 OR2 is about 1.2 miles across and rotates approximately once every four hours. Scientists at NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies said it will make its closest approach to Earth on April 29, but it will still be 16 times farther away than the moon — nearly four million miles.

1998 OR2 is classified as a Potentially Hazardous Object, which are larger than 500 feet and come within 5 million miles of Earth's orbit. After its discovery, NASA said it is ""large enough to cause global effects"" if it impacted Earth, but poses no threat to the planet.

And it won't be the only time the asteroid pays Earth a visit. And next time, it'll come a little closer.

""The radar measurements allow us to know more precisely where the asteroid will be in the future, including its future close approaches to Earth,"" says Flaviane Venditti, a research scientist at the observatory. ""In 2079, asteroid 1998 OR2 will pass Earth about 3.5 times closer than it will this year, so it is important to know its orbit precisely.""

Arecibo said that scientists continue to monitor asteroids for planetary defense purposes, but are following proper social distancing guidelines and wearing masks while making observations.",1

7:20 p.m. Obama criticizes U.S. leaders’ virus response in online graduation speech

WASHINGTON — Former President Barack Obama on Saturday criticized U.S. leaders overseeing the nation’s response to the coronavirus, telling college graduates in an online commencement address that the pandemic shows many officials “aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”

Obama spoke on “Show Me Your Walk, HBCU Edition,” a two-hour event for students graduating from historically black colleges and universities broadcast on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. His remarks were unexpectedly political, given the venue, and touched on current events beyond the virus and its social and economic impacts.

“More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing,” Obama said. “A lot them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”

5:55 p.m. Bittersweet e-ceremony for UIC grad: ‘I didn’t really get to say goodbye’

Edith Mendez watched a slideshow of photos from her college experience, read a Spanish quote she handpicked to thank her family and listened to a speech delivered by her college dean Saturday.

But the 2020 graduate from the University of Illinois at Chicago did so from the backyard of her family’s Berwyn home, not on campus with the momentous ceremony she’d always imagined.

“It was a little bit strange — maybe, in some ways, disappointing,” said Mendez, a first-generation college grad. “Just because I didn’t get to walk across the stage.”

She joined more than 5,000 UIC students — and tens of thousands more at other Illinois schools — left with no choice but to celebrate their graduation with an online ceremony in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

UIC still plans to hold an in-person commencement for their 2020 class sometime later this year, but with the state’s stay-at-home order banning large gatherings, the virtual stand-in will have to do for now.

4:38 p.m. ‘Steady decrease’ in coronavirus cases at Cook County Jail, officials say

Fewer people have tested positive for the coronavirus over the past month at Cook County Jail, officials announced Friday.

The rate of positive COVID-19 tests has gone from 97% to less than 10% since March, Cook County Health officials said in a statement.

Since May 8, most of the new cases have come from detainees entering the jail, rather than people who were already in custody, officials said.

They credited the decline to interventions implemented since the beginning of the year, including opening unused divisions to accommodate social distancing, converting available cells to single-occupancy and enhanced testing.

2:45 p.m. Reopen Illinois rallies draw hundreds to Thompson Center, State Capitol

State health officials on Saturday announced the latest 74 deaths attributed to the coronavirus as several hundred protesters rallied in Chicago and Springfield, calling on Gov. J.B. Pritzker to roll back his executive stay-at-home order.

The Illinois Department of Public Health also said an additional 2,088 people have tested positive for COVID-19, raising the statewide case tally to 92,457. The death toll stands at 4,129.

And for the third straight day, the Northeast region of the state met the medical criteria set by Pritzker’s administration to advance to the third phase of his reopening plan when his stay-at-home expires at the end of the month. That would mean many non-essential businesses including salons and barbershops could reopen with health precautions in place.

Those Phase 3 reopening requirements include holding the coronavirus testing positivity rate under 20% for two weeks. The Northeast region, which includes Chicago and the collar counties, was at 18.8% Saturday.

But even as plans are laid to gear the economy into motion, the governor’s office has said the peak of the pandemic could extend well into the summer.

The virus has been confirmed in all but one Illinois county, while Cook County is registering the most confirmed cases of any county in the nation. More than 1,800 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the state this month alone.

Despite the grim figures, a vocal contingent of demonstrators rallied again outside the Thompson Center in the Loop and the State Capitol Building in Springfield demanding Pritzker reopen the state immediately.

2:09 p.m. Nurse says she regrets going to packed Wisconsin bar without mask

A nurse says she regrets not taking better safety precautions after she was criticized this week for appearing without a mask in a local television interview at a packed Wisconsin bar.

Katie Koutsky, a nurse with the Downers Grove-based Advocate Aurora Health system, says she was helping her sister reopen her suburban Milwaukee bar Wednesday evening when the news crew approached her.

“I have a toddler at home and I’m a full-time nurse, so it’s been very stressful and hard to not be able to go out and be with my friends and family at the bars,” Koutsky said in an interview aired by Milwaukee station WTMJ-TV.

Asked if she was worried about getting the virus from being in a bar without social distancing, she said, “No, I don’t think that the risk presents any higher than me going to a grocery store.”

11:43 a.m. Coronavirus masks a boon for crooks who hide their faces

The way the FBI tells it, William Rosario Lopez put on a surgical mask and walked into the Connecticut convenience store looking to the world like a typical pandemic-era shopper as he picked up plastic wrap, fruit snacks and a few other items. Then, when the only other customer left, he went to the counter, pulled out a small pistol, pointed it at the clerk and demanded that he open the cash register.

The scene, the FBI contends in a court document, was repeated by Lopez in four other gas station stores over eight days before his April 9 arrest. It underscores a troubling new reality for law enforcement: Masks that have made criminals stand apart long before bandanna-wearing robbers knocked over stagecoaches in the Old West and ski-masked bandits held up banks now allow them to blend in like concerned accountants, nurses and store clerks trying to avoid a deadly virus.

“Criminals, they’re smart and this is a perfect opportunity for them to conceal themselves and blend right in,” said Richard Bell, police chief in the tiny Pennsylvania community of Frackville. He said he knows of seven recent armed robberies in the region where every suspect wore a mask.

Across the United States, masks have become more and more prevalent, first as a voluntary precaution and then as a requirement imposed by governmental agencies and businesses. And people with masks — as well as latex gloves — have found their way into more and more crime reports.

Just how many criminals are taking advantage of the pandemic to commit crimes is impossible to estimate, but law enforcement officials have no doubt the numbers are climbing.

11:17 a.m. ‘Everyone has a story’: How will world remember pandemic?

Artist Obi Uwakwe was driving through Chicago’s empty streets, camera on his lap to document life during COVID-19, when he saw something that made him stop: a casket being carried out of a church while a few mourners stood by, their faces covered.

The 43-year-old raised his camera and took a photograph. Later, it would become one of the images Uwakwe used to create paintings inspired by the pandemic.

“To see maybe six people there, everyone wearing a mask,” he said, “it brought everything together.”

Around the world, people like Uwakwe are creating photographs, paintings, emails, journals and social media posts that will shape how the world remembers the coronavirus pandemic for years and centuries to come. Museums and historical societies already are collecting materials, often with help from people accustomed to capturing and sharing even the most mundane moments around them.

The result, historians say, will be a collective memory more personal than perhaps any other moment in history.

10:46 a.m. Democrats push new $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill through House

Democrats powered a massive $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill through the House on Friday, an election-year measure designed to brace a U.S. economy in free fall and a health care system struggling to contain a pandemic still pummeling the country.

The 208-199 vote, with all but one Republican opposed, advances what boils down to a campaign-season display of Democratic economic and health-care priorities. It has no chance of becoming law as written, but will likely spark difficult negotiations with the White House and Senate Republicans. Any product would probably be the last major COVID-19 response bill before November’s presidential and congressional elections.

The enormous Democratic measure would cost more than the prior four coronavirus bills combined. It would deliver almost $1 trillion for state and local governments, another round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals and help for the unemployed, renters and homeowners, college debt holders and the struggling Postal Service.

“Not to act now is not only irresponsible in a humanitarian way, it is irresponsible because it’s only going to cost more,” warned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. “More in terms of lives, livelihood, cost to the budget, cost to our democracy.”

10:00 a.m. Illinois nears 2,000 nursing home deaths as coronavirus continues to spread

Illinois is nearing 2,000 coronavirus deaths at long-term care facilities as new, confirmed cases continue to roll in at hundreds of nursing homes impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

State totals now stand at 1,975 deaths and 13,218 confirmed cases in nursing homes, according to a count by the Chicago Sun-Times. Long-term care facilities account for 48.7% of all coronavirus deaths in Illinois, records show.

The state’s long-term care facilities reported 455 new deaths and 2,405 new cases this week, according to data released Friday by state health officials.

New deaths were reported at 180 facilities this week, and 259 homes said they had at least one new confirmed case.

A total of 86 homes have seen double-digit deaths tallies, up from 50 last week. There are now 27 facilities reporting at least 100 confirmed cases.

9:04 a.m. Last fans standing: Recounting the Sharks-Blackhawks game on March 11, the last game in town before sports shut down

Brandon Saad cut to the front of the net, took a pass and scored through Aaron Dell’s legs in the second period to give the Blackhawks a 3-1 lead over the Sharks.

It was 8:34 p.m. on March 11.

He celebrated in characteristic fashion, with a yell and double fist-pump, as “Chelsea Dagger” blared.

He had no way of knowing — Hawks teammates would say later they didn’t receive any outside information at either intermission — that the world in which he scored his 21st goal of the season was quickly looking a lot different than the world in which he scored his first 20.

Unlike other disasters of this generation, the coronavirus pandemic did not arrive in an instant. John Lennon’s 1980 death stunned a live television audience on ABC’s “Monday Night Football”; Osama Bin Laden’s 2011 death earned an announcement during an MLB game on ESPN. The emergence of COVID-19 was not nearly as sudden or surprising in any given moment.

But if the pandemic did have a specific arrival point, it was the night of March 11.

In a span of roughly two hours, the NBA went from postponing a game due to a player — Jazz center Rudy Gobert — testing positive for the virus to indefinitely suspending the season.

President Donald Trump announced an unprecedented European travel ban. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson became the first American celebrities to test positive. The ill-fated 2020 NCAA Tournament announced it would play without fans.

And during those same two hours, the Hawks and Sharks played a regular-season NHL game like nothing was happening at all.

We take a look back — through the eye of fans — at the last major sports event in Chicago.

7:00 a.m. DePaul, Loyola releases plans for fall semester

As coronavirus cases continue to increase statewide, two Chicago universities are planning to have students on campus this fall.

DePaul University and Loyola University of Chicago have consulted with public health experts and state and local officials to devise their plans for the fall semester.

DePaul expects to have limited in-person learning and reduced occupancy in the dorms this fall. Meanwhile, Loyola hopes to offer both on-campus and online classes.

Both universities said they’ll share more details about the fall semester in the coming weeks.

Loyola also announced its “Loyola Commitment,” a new financial aid program, funded by the university and its donors, which will help students who have been affected by the economic downturn amid the pandemic.

“As unemployment rises along with uncertainty about our economic outlook, we will see a sharp increase in students and families whose plans about attending Loyola might be hindered. Dreams are being crushed by diminished family finances,” Loyola provost Norberto Grzywacz wrote in an email to students. “The scale of this crisis and its financial impact on families will have a profound effect on many students from various backgrounds. In particular, it is expected to impact enrollment and our desire for a vibrant and diverse community as a place of growth, experience, and opportunity.”

12:33 p.m. COVID-19 scales back youth sports. That’s a win for many kids

My heart will break for older teens if they don’t get to play sports in Illinois this summer, or maybe this fall, because of the coronavirus. Most are nearing the end of their competitive sports days, and you hate to see them robbed.

For younger kids, I see a silver lining. It’s a chance for them to do more bike riding. They can learn to rollerblade or skateboard. Maybe they can join their parents for runs or walks.

They could get a much-needed break from an over-scheduled life, especially when it comes to sports.

Or, maybe not. In Missouri, a 40-team youth baseball tournament was held last weekend by GameTime Tournaments. You won’t see this in Illinois right now because of the stay-at-home order to curb the spread of the virus. But, at least one Illinois team, the Black Sox from central Illinois, made the trip, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

GameTime instituted social distancing guidelines, including no high-fives, and sanitized the ball often. But some things can’t be helped in baseball: The catcher always will be positioned behind the batter. Players bump into each other on some plays. Out of habit, coaches are bound to get close to players to give instruction.

After being at home for weeks, the games had to be a relief for the players and parents who watched. But 40 teams? That’s downright irresponsible, even if permissible by Missouri’s looser restrictions related to the virus.

Fewer games, or no games for a year, could be a very good thing for kids.

7:00 a.m. Everything must be on the table as city, state fight back from financial devastation

Washington to cities and states: You’re on your own.

For months, the Trump administration has failed to take the lead in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, punting responsibility to the states. Now the president and his Republican Party are looking to do the same when it comes to helping states and cities survive the pandemic’s financial devastation.

A $3 trillion stimulus package expected to be approved by the Democratic-controlled House looks dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, and President Donald Trump is making clear he would never sign such a bill.

Why? Because the package to rescue drowning cities, suburbs, states, small businesses and unemployed Americans would be fiscally imprudent, they claim.

We couldn’t disagree more. And, yes, this is the same Senate and president who rewrote the federal tax code in 2017 to give billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest one percent of Americans, ballooning the federal deficit.

So what does all this mean for Illinois and Chicago, as well as for towns and counties statewide?

As people are trying to stay safe and disinfect their homes during the coronavirus pandemic, families are searching for ways to buy hand sanitizer, toilet paper and other household essentials to help them stay safe and healthy in quarantine.

One of the biggest problems, though, is that most of those everyday products are still selling out at lightning-quick speeds. This is especially true when it comes to cleaning wipes, which topped the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) list of disinfectants that can help protect against COVID-19. Lysol spray and Clorox wipes could even potentially be in low supply through the end of June.

Whatever you do, don't panic—you can still get your hands on enough cleaning supplies for the whole family—and skip the big crowds in stores—if you shop them at these online retailers. While we'll be updating this list daily, supplies are selling out extremely fast, so we recommend not putting it off more than you need to. Here are the places online where you can buy cleaning wipes and spray right now.

Where to buy cleaning wipes and spray

Cleaning wipes that actually disinfect surfaces are one of the hardest things to find right now, but you can occasionally get them along with cleaning sprays at the following retailers:

Staples

Target

Walmart

Make your own disinfectant wipes

Despite the current shortage of Lysol and Clorox wipes, you can also make your own CDC-approved wipes right at home using a precise balance of bleach or alcohol. We put together comprehensive instructions on how to do so.

How to use cleaning wipes

If you already have cleaning supplies around the house, you'll want to be certain that you're using them the right way. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), disinfection won't happen immediately—it can actually take up to three to five minutes.

Although wipes and sprays are on the EPA's list of approved disinfectants, you may not be using them long enough to keep whatever surface you're cleaning—like a countertop, for instance—wet for the recommended amount of time to kill germs.

As a good rule of thumb, you may want to set a timer so you can monitor surfaces to ensure they're still wet. You may also want to make sure that you're sanitizing frequently-used objects and surfaces daily, especially when it comes to doorknobs, keyboards, faucet handles and more. You don't want to forget your phone, either—you can even use Clorox wipes or 70% isopropyl alcohol on Apple products, according to Apple.

Jonathan Chan, senior lab testing technician at Reviewed, recommends following best practices, and advises that if you're using wipes, you should make sure you're only wiping in one one direction, as studies have suggested that doing so can reduce the risk of recontamination.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Nick Puckett/via Reuters Nick Puckett/via Reuters

Updated at 5:50 p.m. ET



Public health officials closed a restaurant in Castle Rock, Colo., on Monday, one day after its owner hosted a Mother's Day event in which the entire dining room was open to seat customers — most of whom weren't wearing face masks.

Hundreds of people visited the C&C Coffee and Kitchen on Sunday, with some praising its defiance in allowing people to eat breakfast burritos and drink coffee at tables despite broad restrictions that limit Colorado restaurants to carryout service. Images from Sunday morning show the restaurant had a line of people at the door, with a crowd inside.

""I expected it to be busy. I never expected this,"" owner April Arellano told the Castle Rock News-Press on Sunday. ""I'm so happy so many people came out to support the Constitution and stand up for what is right. We did our time. We did our two weeks. We did more than two weeks ... and we were failing. We had to do something.""

But the local health department shut down the restaurant Monday, saying its owners had ignored a warning not to open their dining room.

""The restaurant was ordered to close immediately"" around midday Monday, the Tri-County Health Department said in a statement to NPR.

""It is disheartening that this restaurant has chosen to move ahead of the public orders and not even consider implementing best practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" said Dr. John M. Douglas Jr., the health department's executive director.

In an apparent reference to the restaurant, Gov. Jared Polis said Monday that like many Coloradans, he hasn't seen his mother in weeks — and he wasn't able to take her out on Mother's Day.

""I love my mom far too much to put her at risk by visiting a busy restaurant operating illegally, just to take a selfie with omelets and a mimosa,"" Polis said. He added, ""Colorado — America — we are better than that.""

Even before local officials took action, C&C Coffee and Kitchen received praise while others slammed it, depending on how they view the economic shutdowns triggered by efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic.

A video from inside the restaurant Sunday shows a morning rush, with a chattering crowd of families. As the camera sweeps through the packed dining room, only one person can be clearly seen wearing a protective mask.

The bustling business created the potential risk of a new nexus for more coronavirus cases, Douglas countered, something that shouldn't be done. Anything else, he added, isn't fair to business owners who are following Colorado's ""Safer at Home"" restrictions.

If the C&C Coffee and Kitchen doesn't obey state restrictions, it could lose its license, the health department said. But Douglas also said that if the restaurant agrees to follow the rules on takeout orders, the closure order will be lifted and it can resume operating.

Sunday's rogue opening prompted a flood of comments on the restaurant's Facebook page. Some congratulated Arellano for going against the restrictions, saying she was letting people decide if they wanted to gather in public.

""We had a lovely time and enjoyed the food yesterday!"" one woman wrote. ""Thank you for a breath of fresh air!""

Anyone who didn't agree, the restaurant's backers said, could simply stay away. But others disagreed vehemently, saying they would never patronize a restaurant that defies public health orders — and adding the potential dangers extend far beyond the people who opted to visit.

""So much selfish stupidity. If it was just themselves they were endangering I wouldn't care, but we're all connected. It's a pandemic and people are dying,"" a commenter wrote on member station Colorado Public Radio's Facebook post about the reopening.

Castle Rock, a small city about 30 miles south of Denver, is the county seat of Douglas County. It's in the jurisdiction of the Tri-County Health Department – which issued a reminder Saturday, urging people not to form groups of more than 10 on Mother's Day and to keep everyone at least 6 feet apart.

All Colorado restaurants have been under tight restrictions since March 17, when the state health department's order closing bars, restaurants, gyms, theaters and casinos took effect.

Arellano's decision to reopen her restaurant at full capacity came days after the governor extended the state's disaster emergency declaration through June 6. As Polis issued that order last week, he cited the threat of a disaster that could bring ""widespread or severe damage, injury or loss of life.""

On Friday, Polis said restaurants may be able to reopen by the time Memorial Day weekend arrives at the end of May, depending on the latest data about the coronavirus outbreak.

In a news conference Monday afternoon, Polis said a decision on opening restaurants will be made on May 25.",1
324,324,412,Lightfoot outlines plan for post-pandemic recovery,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Thursday asked a who’s who of Chicago’s movers and shakers to plan for the city’s resurgence after the coronavirus pandemic is finally over.

Standing outside the Water Tower, which survived the Great Chicago Fire, Lightfoot announced a COVID-19 Recovery Task Force co-chaired by the mayor along with her longtime friend Sam Skinner.

Skinner served as White House chief of staff and U.S. Transportation Secretary under former President George H.W. Bush. He is also a former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.

“We don’t know when this crisis will end. … But what we do know is that, when it comes to recovering from this crisis, there are no half-measures. No cutting corners. … The crisis we face today is like nothing any of us have ever experienced. … What we are embarking on is nothing less than the most breathtaking recovery effort our city has ever seen,” the mayor said.

With the statewide stay-at-home order extended to June 1, Lightfoot acknowledged Chicago is “still very much in the thick of the fight” and a “long way from being out of the woods.”

“At the same time, we need to plan in a thoughtful, deliberative way about what the future is gonna look like at the neighborhood level, at the block level, but also at the city and the regional level. That’s what this task force is all about: Assessing the damage that’s been done, the harm — both in economic and … emotional terms — and building a framework for us to transition out of stay-at-home when that time is right,” she said.

The task force the mayor has assembled is a virtual who’s-who of Chicago power brokers.

It will be divided into five working groups: Policy and Economic Stimulus; Mental and Emotional Health; Marketing and Business Development; Regional Coordination; and Economic Change Study.

The Regional Coordination group includes Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, who was swamped by Lightfoot in the 2019 mayoral runoff and has had a frosty relationship with the mayor ever since.

Preckwinkle applauded Lightfoot for her “strong leadership” and said it makes sense for a city and county that “share labor markets and supply chains” to work together.

She stressed the need for a recovery focused heavily on “the devastating impact” the virus has had on “black and brown communities.”

“This pandemic has forced millions of people in the region out of their jobs, with the most vulnerable communities being the hardest hit. Small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, gig workers, artists and independent contractors are experiencing unprecedented challenges and many of them are in the fight of their lives to stay operational. Recovery is paramount to all of us now,” Preckwinkle said.

“There’s no silver bullet for turning things around. But I’m convinced that we can improve our regional outlook through collaborative efforts. Regions with the least inequality perform the best. And for this to happen, we need to work together to drive this change.”

Chicago Federation of Labor President Bob Reiter will serve on a Policy and Economic Stimulus working group that includes Mellody Hobson, co-CEO of Ariel Investments and vice-chair of World Business Chicago. The Federation of Labor has an ownership stake in Sun-Times Media.

Reiter said essential workers on the front lines during the pandemic “need more than just a ‘Thank you.’ Working people need an ambitious plan for recovery that will not just return workers to the pre-pandemic status-quo, but strengthen worker protections and shape a new era of prosperity for the working class of Chicago.”

Alexa James, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Chicago, will serve on the working group for Mental and Emotional Health.

She called the pandemic impact “deep and complicated” — even on those who have lost no one they love to the virus and still have jobs and paychecks while working from home.

“Nearly everyone can identify with the fear and anxiety caused by the shutdown of our city and our economy. ... There is real grief in peoples’ hearts about what we have lost and what has changed. Whether it’s missing milestones like high school graduations and weddings, financial insecurity and instability — we are all feeling a tremendous sense of loss,” James said.

“The fears that people may have will continue, even when the stay-at-home order is lifted. Recovering from this crisis won’t be easy. … We will need to recognize the trauma that the city has faced … [and] plan a response to the long-term impact this crisis will have on the emotional health of our community.”

After introducing the task force, Lightfoot openly acknowledged Chicago Public Schools are planning for at least the possibility that remote learning may need to extend into the fall and the new school year.

“We know that … sometime in early 2021 at the earliest before there’s a vaccine. So, we have to be prepared for a lot of different contingencies, including the worst-case contingency,” she said

“We want to make sure that our children learn. … We want to stand up systems and structures now to be prepared, but also to continue to support our young people in particular because this is really, really difficult stuff on them.”",1
594,594,725,Russia’s levitating ruble: Why oil price collapse has NOT sent currency into FREEFALL,"While low prices for ‘black gold’ keep shaking the world’s economies, and major oil-exporting nations are trying to weather the trend, the Russian national currency has proven it still has an ace up its sleeve.

The collapse of oil prices at the start of March after Russia withdrew from the OPEC+ deal was a disaster for Moscow, which remains heavily reliant on oil exports to fund the budget.

But then an odd thing happened: the price of oil lost 56 percent of its value in the year to date, as of May 7, but the ruble is down by only 19 percent over the same period. Like some Tibetan monetary monk, the ruble’s value has managed to levitate and stay up, even as the oil-price ground fell away from underneath it.

The ruble’s value has long been tied to the price of oil and the two used to move in lockstep. That changed when the Russian Ministry of Finance introduced the so-called budget rule (aka the financial rule), which automatically siphons off any excess oil-export revenue to the National Welfare Fund (NWF) for all revenues earned from oil prices over US$42.

That rule led to the buildup of the reserve fund, which held 12 trillion rubles, or 11 percent of GDP as of April 1, and helped bring down inflation to post-Soviet lows, but, most importantly, largely broke the tie between the ruble’s value and the price of oil.

That has changed now. Since oil prices have fallen below the key US$42 for a cost of a barrel of oil threshold, the budget rule doesn’t make any difference anymore, so oil prices and the value of the ruble should re-engage.

The average value of the ruble in 2018 was 62.7 rubles to the dollar, while the average price of oil was US$70.8. In 2019, the price of oil fell 11.4 percent to US$62.7, while the value of the ruble fell by less, down only 3.2 percent to 64.7, mainly thanks to the steadying effect of the budget rule.

Also on rt.com Covid-19 quarantine could cost Russia $242 BILLION as oil price fall starts to hit budget income

But the changes in the first four months of 2020 have been a lot more dramatic. The average price of oil has shrunk by a third (31.2 percent) to US$43.1 over the first four months – including January and February, when oil prices were US$63.7 and US$55.7 respectively— whereas the average value of the ruble over this period was 68.7 to the dollar, down by only 6 percent.

Even in March and April, the peak of the crisis, the average cost of oil dropped to US$32 and then US$21.2, respectively, or by another quarter (25.8 percent), followed by another collapse by a third (33.6 percent) the following month, but the value of the ruble in those two months was 73.7 and 75.2, down by 7.3 percent in March and a mere 1.9 percent in April.

That’s not to say the ruble has not been battered by the current crisis, which is considered the worst since 1998’s total meltdown of Russia’s financial system, as the chart of the weekly exchange rates of ruble vs dollar shows. But how can the value of the ruble in Russia’s petro-dependent economy defy gravity so easily?

CBR to the rescue

One of the reasons why Russia is expected to weather this crisis a lot better than many of its emerging-markets peers is that Central Bank of Russia (CBR) governor Elvira Nabiullina allowed the ruble to float freely as part of her response to the 2014 oil shock, when oil prices collapsed the last time.

As bne IntelliNews has argued elsewhere, the Kremlin is fixated on preserving Russia’s foreign exchange reserves, which totaled US$569.7 billion as of April 1, because it regards them as a strategic asset. The size of Russia’s reserves means it is impervious to sanctions as it can simply buy its way out of trouble if the US imposes harsh sanctions, without the need to borrow on the international capital markets that would make it vulnerable to sanction pressure.

The CBR has shown it’s prepared to allow the exchange rate to take the brunt of the oil shock to preserve those reserves, and has not been defending its currency, unlike many countries, Turkey notable among them, that have also seen their currencies collapse. Moreover, the money in the NWF also won’t be used to defend the ruble as that money is solely tasked with supporting the budget and covering the 3–4 trillion-ruble federal budget deficit expected this year.

During the 2014 oil-price shock, the ruble also tanked, and by a lot more. Before that crisis, it had been trading at about 35 rubles to the dollar for several years, but it suddenly dropped to a nadir of circa 80 to the dollar.

Investors freaked out and called Nabiullina reckless and incompetent, but then, as now, she refused to burn through Russia’s reserves to defend an indefensible exchange rate.

That crisis started in October and peaked in December, when the CBR finally imposed a 17 percent emergence rate hike on December 16, 2014 to put a floor under the collapse of the currency. The ruble has lost a lot less value than it did in those few months in 2014, which has meant both the investors and the population have greeted this crisis with greater calm than in 2014. And it also means the economic damage done by this crisis – as far as currency effects are concerned – is mild by comparison.

Amazingly, unlike 2014, when the CBR made the biggest one-off rate hike in Russian history, the CBR actually cut rates by an aggressive 50bp at its last policy meeting in April to 5.5 percent, in an effort to give the economy a growth-boosting shot in the arm. April’s cut in rates demonstrates an entirely different mindset.

Usually, during a crisis, emerging-market central banks are forced to hike rates to protect their currency, as Russia did in 2014, whereas developed-market economies cut them to boost growth. And, indeed, the first thing the US Federal Reserve did in April was cut US interest rates to zero.

Nabiullina had a difficult choice in April, as she could have gone both ways: cut rates to boost growth, or hike rates to head off inflation caused by the devaluation of the ruble. But it is a testimony to the effective management of Russia’s central bank since she took over in 2013 that she had a choice, and ended up choosing the developed market’s response to a nasty external shock.

Defending the ruble

The CBR abandoned the “ruble exchange rate corridor” at the end of 2014 – a mechanism that had been in place for almost two decades and obliged it to manage the value of the ruble’s value and stop rapid devaluations.

Russia’s reserves fell this year from a peak of just over US$580 billion to just under US$570 billion as of the start of April, but most of that fall is due to foreign-exchange revaluation effects of the assets the CBR uses to hold Russia’s reserves. The CBR has spent a mere circa US$2 billion of actual cash in the past month in money-market interventions to smooth out the fall in the ruble’s value, which is very little.

Indeed, astonishingly, Russia’s reserves have actually increased this year, by just over US$7 billion from US$562.3 billion, as of January 1. The reserves fell slightly from US$570.3 billion in February to US$563.4 billion in March, but, amazingly, then grew again in April to the current US$569.7 billion.

The CBR will not touch Russia’s foreign-exchange reserves to defend the value of the ruble, and it can’t use the money in the NWF either, which technically belong to the Ministry of Finance. However, the government has come up with a dodge to make more dollars available to the CBR to defend the ruble, which explains its gravity-defying performance over the past two months.

On April 11, the CBR rushed through a deal to sell its 50 percent+1 stake in the state-owned retail banking giant Sberbank to the Ministry of Finance for 2.14 trillion rubles (US$29.1 billion). The change of ownership solves several problems in one go. First, the central bank was in the uncomfortable position of both being the banking-sector regulator and the owner of by far the largest bank in the sector. Now that bank is owned by the Ministry of Finance, which is how it should be.

Second, the deal will put more money into the budget. Sberbank is the most profitable bank in the sector, and recently promised to increase its dividend payments to 50 percent of its income, because the government increasingly uses dividends to tap the profits of its best companies, rather than taxes. However, the CBR regularly held back part of those payments to keep on its own balance sheet.

Now, all of Sberbank’s dividends will be paid directly into the budget. Third, the deal, in effect, provides a back-door route for the CBR to tap the NWF, giving it cash to spend in the money markets to defend the ruble. The Ministry of Finance paid for the deal using NWF money, which has now dropped to about 9 trillion rubles.

This last point is key, as the CBR’s alternative to holding up the ruble’s value was to hike rates again, which would have killed off whatever growth the Russian economy is due to put in during its recovery from April’s crash.

Just how the CBR will use this money remains unclear, but the US$29 billion it now has is thought to be enough to defend the ruble until September, by which time the government hopes the situation will have stabilized and oil prices will have recovered enough to take the pressure off the government’s finances, especially after the OPEC++ production-cut deal that will reduce production of oil by 9.7mbpd and was signed on April 13.

“The CBR will be gradually selling [the US$29bn] until the end of September, [as long] as the price of Urals stays below US$25 a barrel,” Ivan Tkachev, the economics editor of RBC, said in a recent article.

“Since the onset of these interventions, the [Russian benchmark blend] Urals price has never exceeded the threshold, and the CBR sold more than US$2 billion in April. The more Russian oil deviates from US$25, the higher the amount of currency sold by the CBR. Thus, the central bank is effectively compensating for the shortfall of export earnings, supplying the domestic market with that amount of currency as if the Urals price was US$25.”

The CBR’s currency sales will automatically protect the ruble from depreciating too much while oil prices stay low, and buys the government five months of time for the worst effects of the crisis to fade. At US$25 per barrel, the estimated fair value of the ruble is 75–76 rubles to the dollar, estimates Tkachev.

The price of Brent was US$30.97 as of May 9 and the value of the ruble was 73.4 rubles – slightly better than Tkachev’s lower band estimate of oil and exchange-rate forecasts. And the Sberbank money is not the only resources that the government has brought to the ruble’s defense. In addition to the CBR’s own operations, the Ministry of Finance also sells currency on the money markets. The CBR’s statistics aggregate data on both mechanisms, since it’s the CBR, which is the currency sales agent in both cases, says Tkachev.

“Unlike the CBR’s variable sales, the Finance Ministry’s operations are fixed one month in advance. In April, its daily foreign-currency sales amount to the equivalent of 3.5 billion rubles (circa US$46 million). But from March 10, when the CBR launched currency interventions on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, until April 22, more than US$5 billion was sold using both channels,” says Tkachev.

The sale of dollars under the fiscal rule is not happening, as oil prices are under the key US$42 per barrel level. However, on May 8, the CBR formalized an informal ‘auxiliary fiscal rule.’ The CBR announced that it will intervene in the foreign-exchange markets when Russia’s Urals blend of oil (which usually costs about US$2 less than Brent) drops below US$25.

That means the CBR will sell an additional US$0.5– 1.5 billion on the open market for every US$5/bbl decline in the Urals oil price below the lower threshold, analysts at VTB Capital estimate.

“That’s the main reason the ruble has not followed oil prices down in their dramatic plunge,” says Tkachev.

846,846,1015,Family of Amazon employee who died of COVID-19: 'We want answers',"Family of Amazon employee who died of COVID-19: 'We want answers' ""Their workers aren’t just a number,"" the man's niece said.

As Amazon faces increased calls for transparency over how many employees have tested positive for COVID-19, the company confirmed to ABC News on Friday that another warehouse worker in New York has died amid the pandemic.

George Leigh, who worked at a facility in Long Island, died of complications from coronavirus on April 9, his niece Jasmine Leigh told ABC News. She added that George's family was in the middle of planning a surprise party for his upcoming 60th birthday at the end of summer.

""He was always loving, caring and bright,"" Jasmine Leigh said of her uncle. ""He was really close to his mom and all his siblings. He would call his mom every day.""

""We just want to get answers from Amazon,"" she added. ""We just want to get his story out there because we don't think that Amazon is doing enough to protect their workers. ... We also want for Amazon to be more aware of their workers. Their workers aren't just a number.""

Amazon did not respond to an ABC News inquiry over how many employees so far have died from COVID-19, but pressure appears to be building on the company as more deaths are reported in the media.

Workers protest against the failure from their employers to provide adequate protections in the workplace of the Amazon delivery hub on National May Day Walkout/Sickout by workers at Amazon, Whole Foods, Innstacart and Shipt amid the Covid-19 pandemic in Hawthorne, Calif., May 1, 2020.

""We are saddened by the loss of an associate who had worked at our site in Bethpage, New York. His family and loved ones are in our thoughts,"" Rachael Lighty, an Amazon spokesperson, told ABC News in a statement.

He was last at work March 28, according to Amazon, which also said it's notified all associates within the building of their colleague's death.

Earlier this week, a coalition of 13 attorneys general led by Maura Healey of Massachusetts sent a letter to Amazon pressing for stronger measures to protect the health and safety of workers amid the pandemic, and requesting information on how many workers have been infected and how many have died.

""We have requested but not received information on how many of the Companies' workers have been infected with COVID-19, and how many have died from it. Please provide a state-by-state breakdown for each Company with this information,"" the letter stated.

The letter added that the attorneys general were ""dismayed to have heard multiple reports of Amazon warehouses with inadequate PPE and hand sanitizer, inability to practice social distancing, limited opportunity to wash hands, and other deficiencies that put employees at risk.""

Healey's office said in a statement that the state attorneys general are ""alarmed by recent media reports"" that allege ""insufficient data about infections and deaths"" among Amazon workers.

In an interview that aired Sunday with CBS, Amazon's head of operations, Dave Clark, didn't answer when asked how many workers had tested positive for COVID-19.

""The actual ... total number of cases isn't particularly useful because it's relative to the size of the building and then the overall community infection rate,"" Clark told CBS.

""We know,"" he added, when pressed for the figure. ""I don't have the number right on me at this moment because it's not a particularly useful number.""

Lighty told ABC News ensuring the health and safety of employees is a ""top concern"" for Amazon, adding that they ""expect to invest approximately $4 billion from April to June on COVID-related initiatives to get products to customers and keep employees safe.""

""We are going to great lengths to keep the buildings extremely clean and help employees practice important precautions such as social distancing and other measures,"" Lighty said in the statement, adding that Amazon directly alerts, via text message, every person at a site anytime there's a confirmed diagnosis, including information on when that individual was last in the building.

Jasmine Leigh said that she and her family would like to see even more information from Amazon when a worker tests positive for COVID-19, noting that George Leigh came in contact with so many people at work every day and that they don't know how he was exposed to the virus.

""He trained a lot of people, so who knows how many people he got in contact with?"" Jasmine Leigh said. ""Them not saying anything is not helping anyone.""

Jasmine Leigh said that she wants her uncle to be remembered by ""how many people loved him.""

""Even with him dying, we've got a lot of people, his coworkers reaching out to us and saying, 'Oh, he was a very funny guy, he would come to work every day with a smile on his face and everybody would be so happy to see him,'"" she said.",1
1057,1057,1253,Judge Denies “Pharma Bro” Shkreli Prison Release to Research Coronavirus Cure: “Delusional”,"Defense attorney Benjamin Brafman walks with former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli after the jury issued a verdict at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York on Aug. 4, 2017, in Brooklyn. Drew Angerer/Getty Images

Remember Martin Shkreli? The 37-year-old who infamously became known as “Pharma Bro” and was sentenced in March 2018 to seven years behind bars after he was convicted of securities fraud for lying to investors is back in the news. This time it’s because a judge roundly rejected his request to be released from prison early so that he could work on a cure for the coronavirus. “The court does not find that releasing Mr. Shkreli will protect the public, even though Mr. Shkreli seeks to leverage his experience with pharmaceuticals to help develop a cure for COVID-19 that he would purportedly provide at no cost,” District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto wrote. “In any event, Mr. Shkreli’s self-described altruistic intentions do not provide a legal basis to grant his motion.”

Shkreli had requested to be released from prison for three months to work on a cure for the coronavirus. Defense attorney Benjamin Brafman filed a motion calling for the release of Shkreli to home detention at his fiancée’s New York City apartment, saying he would “potentially help others” find a “potential cure” for COVID-19. Shkreli posted a research proposal online in which he characterized the current response to the pandemic as “inadequate” and that his background “as a successful two-time biopharma entrepreneur, having purchased multiple companies, invented multiple new drug candidates” would put him in a good position to aid current efforts. “I have always said that if focused and left in a lab, Martin could help cure cancer,” Brafman said in a statement. “Maybe he can help the scientific community better understand this terrible virus.”

In denying the request, Matsumoto pointed to the way probation officials characterized Shkreli’s claim that he could help to find a COVID-19 cure just the type of “delusional self-aggrandizing behavior” that contributed to his conviction. “Shkreli has no formal scientific training and no experience working [in] a laboratory setting, and he does not explain why he cannot continue to develop and discuss any ideas he may have about COVID-19 from prison, as he has,” prosecutors wrote to the judge. And even if he were to somehow find a cure, there’s no evidence to suggest he would not use it “to enrich himself to the maximum extent possible, including by concealing his work or declining to provide such a cure to others unless he were paid an exorbitant sum.”

The judge also rejected the idea that Shkreli’s childhood asthma somehow puts him at particular risk for catching the coronavirus in the low-security Pennsylvania prison where he is being detained that has not reported any cases. “Not surprised but very disappointed,” Brafman, said of the decision. “Notorious defendant never catches a break even when well deserved and in the best interest of the country.”",1

Online platforms like Zoom and GoToMeeting have adjusted their platforms for high-demand use so that more people can work remotely and have kids continue the school year with online classes. We’ve discovered that while it’s clearly not for everyone, it’s not so bad.

But some “innovations” just sound like a bad idea from the get-go.

Would you let your loved one be put in that?

Now, I’m not against a sign company looking to meet a need in the community and repurpose their facility for that.

BUT… there’s just so much wrong with this.

First, having a hospital bed that converts into a coffin is just ghoulish. We don’t send people to the hospital expecting them to die. There is no hope left when someone is put in a bed that could instantly be converted into their coffin.

Second, it’s made of cardboard. That’s dehumanizing. This isn’t a small pet that you bury in the backyard in a shoebox, these are human beings not Speedy the Wonder Hamster that your third-grader is crying over.

Remind me, what happens when cardboard gets wet? Because that could be a problem. You clearly can’t clean someone on this thing, and what about feeding? What happens if someone spills water on it? The biggest problem that I see is that the body itself contains fluids like blood, saliva, sputum, urine, and other things, all of which can spread disease. Even if this thing was treated to be “waterproof” you’d have to toss it the minute bodily fluids touched it and in a hospital setting that would be in pretty short order.

This is a clear case of “didn’t think that one through” and “didn’t consult with a single medical professional.”

But you know that morons in government are going to see this as a brilliant and much-needed innovation in the midst of a pandemic.

Speaking of morons in government…

These bed/coffin combo units might be Governor Cuomo’s new state-mandated nursing home beds–because that completely fits with his policies. Maybe he’ll add in blankets that can double as a body-bag since he’s already sending body bags to nursing homes.

[Quick Update from the author: I think I’m being unfair to Governor Cuomo who has rescinded his disastrous policy that forces nursing homes to take COVID-positive patients now that thousands of people senselessly died. I should also include the other governors who sent COVID-positive patients into nursing homes but have not rescinded the order like New Jersey’s Phil Murphy and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, as well as those simply covering up the data like California’s Gavin Newsom.]

923,923,1097,Unemployment ticks higher in China as coronavirus shock to economy persists,"This photo taken on February 28, 2020 shows workers producing face masks at a factory in Handan in China's northern Hebei province. STR | AFP via Getty Images

BEIJING — The unemployment rate in China remained near historic highs in April, highlighting the challenges the world's second-largest economy still faces in recovering fully from the economic shock of the coronavirus. China's official, but highly doubted, urban unemployment rate rose to 6.0% in April, from 5.9% in March, according to figures released Friday by the National Bureau of Statistics. ""The pressure on employment is rather large,"" bureau spokeswoman Liu Aihua told reporters at least three times during Friday's press conference. That's according to a CNBC translation of her Mandarin-language remarks.

Although monthly figures for the overall economy show some recovery, challenges remain, such as resuming work and the impact of the virus overseas, Liu said. ""Right now, the trajectory of economic development still requires observation, but ... based on the results of policies for resuming work and production, we have the confidence, ability and basis for extending the momentum of recovery and improvement."" Liu noted that the bureau's survey found that at the end of April, the number of migrant workers who had returned to their jobs in the cities was about 90% of what it was a year ago. In early March, official figures showed the return to work for migrant workers from the poorest households in the country was about half of what it was a year ago. More than half of China extended the Lunar New Year holiday by at least a week in an effort to control the Covid-19 disease, which first emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan. By early March, the virus outbreak had stalled domestically while accelerating its spread overseas. Covid-19 has now killed more than 302,000 people worldwide, including over 4,600 in China.

Slowing economy to hit more jobs

Similar lockdowns on economic activity in the U.S. sent the unemployment rate soaring to 14.7% in April, the highest since World War II and up from months of historic lows near 4% or less. In February, the peak of the coronavirus outbreak in China, the unemployment rate jumped to a record high of 6.2%. For the 25 to 59-year-old group, the rate has hovered near 5.5% for the last three months. The average work-hours a week per employee also fell in April by 30 minutes to 44.3 hours, the data showed. China's unemployment data have been highly doubted, even after the country changed its methodology from worker claims to a survey in 2018 in an effort to capture more of the job losses. The urban unemployment rate has hovered near 4% to 5% for the last 20 years. ""We think that pressure on employment will continue,"" Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance, said Friday. He pointed to factors such as fewer new jobs due to slower economic growth, sluggish demand for Chinese exports and a record-high number of university graduates this year. The continued struggles of small and medium-sized enterprises, which contribute to the majority of jobs and growth in China, adds further pressure to employment. Pang pointed to third-party business registration data that showed 460,000 companies closed in the first quarter, while the establishment of 3.2 million new Chinese companies during that time still marked a nearly 29% decrease from a year ago.

902,902,1076,Coronavirus has changed online dating. Here’s why some say that’s a good thing,"When California issued a stay-at-home order back in March to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Dana Angelo, a 33-year-old copywriter at an ad agency in Los Angeles, found herself with more free time. So, out of boredom, she turned to a social activity she could still do from home: She got back on the dating app, Bumble.

Angelo said she’s been rotating through online dating apps — she’s also tried Tinder and Hinge — with minimal luck since getting out of a long-term relationship about a year ago, and had recently been taking a break. “You just see the same people on all of them and then it gets kind of depressing,” Angelo said.

But something surprising happened this time around: She actually met someone she genuinely likes. With the possibility of sex — or any physicial intimacy — off the table for now due to social distancing, she said it was easier to sort out matches who were just “cycling through people” from those who were actually looking for a relationship.

After texting for a few days, she organized a virtual date via FaceTime with the match she liked, chatting over drinks for about two hours. The third time, their FaceTime date was over brunch, for about four hours. Eventually, they took the step of meeting in person with a walk in his neighborhood — albeit keeping a 6-foot distance, with her dog in between them.

In the midst of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, a frightening global event that has negatively affected people’s lives in many ways, including causing intense loneliness and isolation for some, Angelo found a rare bright spot. It has actually improved her dating life.

“I’m not used to someone making this much effort,” she said.

“It’s an excellent time for singles to date,” said Helen Fisher, the chief scientific adviser to Match.com and a senior research fellow at The Kinsey Institute. “People have time. They’re not getting dressed up to go to work. And most importantly, they have something to talk about.”

Not everyone, though, is keen to get into online dating, even if spending more time than usual alone at home has made some otherwise happily single people reconsider their feelings about finding a long-term companion. Not to mention that the pandemic has ushered in mass unemployment, higher levels of stress, greater strain for single parents and worries about fatal risks from stepping outside your door — factors not necessarily conducive to romance. While some have sought solace on dating apps, others are looking to online communities to connect with those who are also having a hard time, or focusing on friends and family who were already part of their life before the coronavirus.

Still, some daters looking for a relationship in the time of social isolation are finding opportunity. “Watch the pandemic be the reason why I might get into a meaningful relationship, because we had to take the time to get to know each other,” Angelo said.

Dating goes virtual

The popularity of online dating has grown immensely over the last decade, and is now the most common way that couples in the U.S. meet. A study by Stanford’s School of Humanities and Sciences found that 39 percent of heterosexual couples reported meeting online in 2017, compared with 22 percent in 2009. The number was even higher for same-sex couples that year, 60 percent of whom reported meeting online in 2017.

Fifty years ago, a global pandemic might have hindered single people from connecting with prospects through their family, friends or faith communities. But these days, most people are connecting virtually to start anyway. “The influence of technology on our romantic and sexual lives has been so enormous,” said Justin Garcia, an evolutionary biologist and sex researcher at The Kinsey Institute. “From online dating, to texting, video chatting, sexting, etc., we have already been in the midst of a digital revolution for human courtship,” he added, so it’s not a huge surprise that singles would continue dating this way in the midst of a pandemic.

“Watch the pandemic be the reason why I might get into a meaningful relationship, because we had to take the time to get to know each other.”

The stay-at-home orders issued across the country have been a boon for some of the major online dating apps. “As a city goes into lockdown, engagement on OKCupid goes up,” the app’s global chief marketing officer, Melissa Hobley, said. Since March, the company has seen a whopping 700 percent increase in the amount of OKCupid users going on a virtual date. The app Hornet, which caters to the gay male community, has seen a 30-percent increase in social feed engagement since social distancing measures began in mid-March, according to CEO Christof Wittig. And the dating app Tinder reported that it saw more engagement on March 29 than on any other day in its history, with more than 3 billion users swiping to connect with people, according to an April 1 press release.

Once dating app users have made an initial connection, the way that they are getting to know each other has changed significantly during this period of social distancing. Most bars and restaurants, traditional first date spots, are closed down, and those who elect to meet up with a stranger could risk contracting COVID-19 themselves, or spreading it to others.

As a result, many singles have taken their meetups online, electing to go on virtual dates via Zoom or FaceTime, or through video chat features on the dating apps themselves. Recent surveys conducted by online dating companies indicate that members are more inclined to try this now than ever before.

A study conducted by Match found that while only 6 percent of singles were using a video platform to meet a potential date before the COVID-19 outbreak, 69 percent of singles said they’d be open to chatting over video with someone they met on a dating app during quarantine as of mid-April. Twenty-two percent of these respondents even said they’d consider entering an exclusive relationship with someone they hadn’t met in person, indicating an openness to cultivating relationships mostly online. As of the end of April 23, 51 percent of users on the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel said they planned to video chat more, and 18 percent had had at least one video call with a match.

The outbreak “has sort of turned our social behavior upside down,” Garcia said. He noted that terror management theory — which suggests that people evaluate their environments and social interactions differently when faced with their own mortality — may explain why singles have been more open to trying new things during this period.

This is true for sexual relationships, in some cases. The Kinsey Institute recently conducted a study of a diverse range of adults aged 18-81, and found that while 43.5 percent had seen their sex life decline during the coronavirus pandemic, one in five respondents reported they had tried adding new things to their sexual repertoire, such as sexting, sending nude photos to someone else, or watching pornography. But it’s also true for those pursuing romantic relationships, as these people have had to reconsider what they want, and how best to meet and connect with people under lockdown.

“If we weren’t in lockdown and some guy asked me to do a FaceTime date, I would think that’s strange and weird,” said 35-year-old Nashville resident Maureen Iselin. But now, “I feel like it’s just socially acceptable.” After ending a long-term relationship in the fall, Iselin got back on dating apps. Instead of putting her dating life on hold during the pandemic, she recently agreed to chat over FaceTime with a man she met online.

WATCH:What COVID-19 has meant for dating in America

“It was a whole new way of thinking about dating. Like, do I get dressed up to this? Do I put on makeup? What are we gonna talk about besides the coronavirus and being in quarantine?” Iselin said. She added that going on a FaceTime date took off a little bit of the pressure because they were both in their home environments, and she planned to do one again with the same person.

“It’s a test of how well you actually converse, and you get to know someone in a different way,” said 26-year-old Naakita Feldman-Kiss, who has been conversing via FaceTime and Zoom with women she’s met on the dating app Lex, and has exchanged gifts with some of them. “There’s actually this deeper intimacy that I’ve developed with people, because … it doesn’t really allow for silence in the same way,” Feldman-Kiss said. “I really kind of like the slow burn of getting to know people over phone and video and text,” said Holly Samuelson, a 34-year-old from San Francisco who recently had a date over FaceTime where she and her date sketched drawings of each other (both are artistically inclined — he’s a builder, while she’s a fashion designer). Although the guy she had been talking to online lives 100 miles away, she said that distance seemed less of a deal breaker since California shut down amid the pandemic.

Rachel Ware, a 27-year-old project manager in Atlanta, recently went on a socially distant jog in a park with someone she met through Facebook’s dating feature, and managed to chat with him for a steady 3 miles. She said she actually liked being able to meet up with an online connection in the park because it feels safer and more secure than a bar, for example. “I’m a very private person and I’m very wary about security,” Ware said. “I like parks because they’re a public space, and you can meet someone and not feel the pressure.”

Of course, just because potential suitors are open to video dating doesn’t mean the connection is guaranteed to be strong. “There will still be time wasters who take phone calls for connection but it doesn’t mean when this is all over they’re looking for a relationship,” said Francesca Hogi, a love and life coach based in L.A. who has a number of clients that have recently tried out virtual dating, including Holly Samuelson.

For Justin Becker, a 33-year-old lawyer based in Washington, D.C., the coronavirus has more or less put his dating life on hold. He recently chatted over Google Hangouts with a guy he met in person before the pandemic began, but has not done so with anyone he met on a dating app. Becker said he had a hard time believing that video dates could move a relationship forward, with someone he had never met in person: “I feed off someone else’s energy, and I do not get energy through an app whatsoever.”

Embracing the “slow burn”

Before the novel coronavirus hit, U.S. couples were already getting married later in life than ever before. Helen Fisher said what’s happening now is increasing the amount of time people spend in a “courtship” stage even more.

“We’re seeing the emergence of a new phase in the courtship trajectory, which is meet online, talk online, then talk in person,” Fisher added. “Yes, we’re moving forward to the past. We’re getting to know somebody before the sex.”

But, for some, slowing down has encouraged them to open up about priorities and feelings earlier on than they would have otherwise.

“We’re moving forward to the past. We’re getting to know somebody before the sex.”

Connor Price, a 40-year-old who recently moved from New York to Los Angeles to work for a music nonprofit, found that true when he started seeing a woman right around the time California shut down. The woman, whom he had met through a close friend, didn’t want to put her mother in danger of contracting the virus. So she and Price started taking nightly walks in their neighborhoods, keeping 6 feet distance from one another.

“It also almost felt like dating in the Elizabethan era,” Price said. “If I could get, like, one little finger tip, in between her shoulder blades through a parka, that was like the most exciting thing I’ve had in a month.”

Gradually, the two have started to spend more time together, and even shared their first kiss of the pandemic while making dinner one night. Because their activities have been limited, they’ve had serious conversations early on about what they want out of a relationship.

“We had some very personal conversations much earlier in a relationship I think either one of us would have had because we’re spending actually a lot of time with each other. We kind of cut off the entire rest of the world and it’s just the two of us,” Price said. “Normally, these kind of conversations don’t come out for six months.”

Fisher argues that the coronavirus-related shutdowns have made conditions ripe for romance like the one Price entered at the beginning of March.

“When your daily habits change, it’s novel. And novelty drives up dopamine in the brain,” the biological anthropologist said. “The novelty is setting up the brain, priming the brain for love. It’s a very good time for romance.”

“I truly believe this is how you need to get to know people, anyway,” Price said. “This kind of slowed us both down and made us calculate how and when we wanted to do things. It’s been fun.”

Missing connection

Of course not everyone is looking for the sort of long-term relationship Fisher spoke about, while others who were content being single before the pandemic have had a harder time dealing with being alone as they stay home and miss the normal social interactions of daily life and human touch.

“I think the desire for a romantic relationship is certainly heightened right now,” said Shani Silver, a writer and host of the podcast A Single Serving. “It’s a lot easier to feel lonely, particularly romantically lonely.”

While Silver has shaped her brand around being “an advocate for single women as whole, happy beings,” she recently penned an essay for Refinery29 in which she wrote about the challenges of being alone during the coronavirus pandemic. After experiencing a serious bout of depression, she wrote that she suddenly felt “an instinctual, threatened, terrified loneliness that needed a hug and an apocalypse partner and neither were available. I didn’t know how long I would be alone for, and for the first time in a very long time, I cared.” In other words, it made her think, “I just want a f***ing husband.”

On the Facebook group for Silver’s podcast, women grapple with some of the same feelings that she’s experienced while holed up in her Brooklyn apartment, sharing stories about “quarantine” texts from exes or “one and done dates,” the struggle of being the last single person in their social circle, and getting through nights where they just feel very lonely.

Silver said she’s been irked by the ways that online dating companies have sought to capitalize on the pandemic by encouraging more people to make distance dating a priority at this time.

“What does that say to single people? ‘Don’t worry, we know how awful this is that you’re single. We want to make sure you can tell that even during a global pandemic,’” Silver said, criticizing the tone that some dating apps have taken in recent weeks. “It’s hurtful, honestly.”

Even on apps designed for in-person connection, it’s clear that many are feeling isolated and lonely at this time. On Lex, which caters to LGBTQ women, users post personal ads with headlines such as “Numb,” or “Quarantine Mood,” where they write about “feeling deeply unloveable,” “touch deprived,” or “bored and confined.”

While Silver recognizes that there will undoubtedly be quarantine love stories that arise out of the coronavirus, she’s more concerned about the “thousands and thousands of single people” who won’t meet a significant other during this time. For now, she prefers to focus on “connections we can safely have that are just as meaningful and that don’t involve making us feel like crap in the meantime.”

There are certainly singles who have sought to do this. Twenty-six-year-old Patrick Easley had been talking to a few guys on Hinge and Tinder, but lost the momentum when he moved back home to be with his mother, who is 60. “It’s this weird emotional purgatory, because people do want that interpersonal interaction,” Easley said of dating right now. “You can only date someone that you don’t know online or over the phone for so long.”

For now, Easley’s put off dating to focus on spending time with his mom, with little regret: “Getting to know her as an independent adult is really cool.”

We don’t know how single life and dating culture will be changed by the end of the coronavirus pandemic, but already it has seemed to challenge nearly everyone — single or not — to contemplate their closest relationships, and how they cultivate connection in the midst of a crisis.

Justin Becker said that while he misses physical connections with other men, he’ll be more thoughtful about how he chooses to enter relationships moving forward. “I tend to be a little serial monogamist when it comes to dating, where I want to jump into the next serious thing.” He said that this period of being home more often than usual has made him reflect on to whom he wants to commit.

In the future, he said, he’ll take the time to consider, “are they someone that complements you and brings out the best in you, versus just having someone to have someone?”",1
1147,1147,1413,'Hygiene is the new luxury': How cruise ship design could evolve to ward against outbreaks,"The world is acutely aware of the risks of boarding a cruise ship after coronavirus ran rampant on ships for the first few months of 2020, infecting hundreds and forcing passengers into quarantine – sometimes for weeks at a time, both while on board and after disembarkation.

With the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's no-sail order set to expire in late July, cruise lines are starting to consult design experts to ensure passenger safety and minimize risk of infection from coronavirus and other viral outbreaks in the future.

""Nothing will be more critical to resuming sustained and profitable long term operations than making cruising the safest option in (the) travel and leisure space and providing cruisers with peace of mind,"" Frank Del Rio, CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., said on an earnings call Thursday.

Cleaning a floating petri dish: How is a cruise ship sanitized after a coronavirus outbreak?

""Ships are currently formulating similar plans to address outbreaks of COVID-19, and these plans could also be modified to prevent and respond to other communicable illnesses in the future,"" Aimee Treffiletti, chief of the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program, told USA TODAY last month.

Norwegian reveals reopening plan: Cruise line will relaunch five ships at a time, estimates 5-6 months before fleet is back up

Most cruise lines haven't revealed concrete plans yet but suggested changes may include revamping dining rooms and other highly trafficked areas to promote social distancing.

However, AMK Architecture & Design, a Greek firm that specializes in hotel and cruise ship interiors and has worked on more than 120 marine-based projects for lines such as Celebrity and Costa, is already working on future strategies.

""The core of the hospitality business – no matter where it is, is essentially the same, and that is to provide guests with the ultimate experience during their stay,"" Anna Koustsoukosta, AMK's principal architect and managing partner, told USA TODAY. ""The cruise industry, however, which is a floating hotel, is a much more difficult and complex application.""

Now another degree of difficulty has been added to the challenge of designing a cruise ship: How do you stop the spread of COVID-19 or other highly contagious viruses in the future? And how do you continue to offer passengers the convenience of a large cruise ship while prioritizing safety?

""Necessity is the mother of invention, and in this period, we need to reinvent how the passenger moves in the ship and interacts with the ship,"" said Koustsoukosta.

Why are cruise ships so high-risk?

Cruise ships squeeze hundreds or thousands of guests into a relatively small space, and megaships play a prominent role in the industry. Royal Caribbean's 1,188-foot Symphony of the Seas, for instance, can accommodate nearly 9,000 passengers and crew.

""Like other close-contact environments, ships may facilitate the transmission of respiratory viruses from person to person through exposure to respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces,"" Treffiletti said.

Cruises, which have a the-more-the-merrier philosophy, are never a solitary affair. The fun centers around myriad group activities in a nonstop party atmosphere. Sipping cocktails around the pool, filling showrooms for Las Vegas-style revues, dancing, playing games or lining up at the buffet table all offer viruses opportunities to spread.

'Inherently high-risk setting': Are cruise ships unsafe – and will they change?

But ships are facing a potential new reality in which cruise lines' business model will change: The number of passengers could be restricted – either by the CDC or cruise lines – to ensure physical distancing. If that change happens, the lines will need to look at new ways to generate revenue in addition to creating an environment in which they are ready for onboard emergencies such as a viral outbreak.

What kind of changes are needed?

""The aim is to suggest solutions to reduce the need for touch interaction, make surfaces and frequently-touched points virus resistant and shape the layout of areas of the ship so as to enable safe and at-distant flow of passengers and crew, without sacrificing socializing, which is one of the important ingredients of the cruise,"" said Koustsoukosta.

Dustin Schafer, director of engineers and senior vice president at Henderson Engineering, who is working on strategies to stop viruses in buildings, said similar ideas would apply to cruise ships, where space is at a premium and social distancing is harder.

“Air and surface cleaning becomes even more critical,"" he told USA TODAY. ""As a first-line strategy, I would recommend retrofits to remove required touch points throughout the ships.""

Embarkation and disembarkation areas

The first crowded public area most cruisers encounter is the embarkation area, where passengers check in and present travel documents before boarding their ship. AMK suggests making the following changes to make these areas less of a petri dish:

A ""sanitization gate"" at the embarkation/disembarkation area of the ship to ensure hygiene protocols are followed

Technology to limit or rid cruise ships of check-in lines

Anti-microbial carpets for public areas and cabin corridors

Automatic doors for entrance and exit points to avoid unnecessary touching

Passenger cabins

Koustsoukosta expects that luxury cabins and suites will become first preference for passengers since those rooms provide access to fresh air.

Diamond Princess:A visual guide to the ship that gave rise to 712 COVID-19 cases

Koustsoukosta suggests creating an enclosed space akin to a mudroom just outside the cabin where passengers could place clothing and shoes worn prior to entering their cabin. Crew could also leave food and linens in the event of a quarantine.

Inside the cabin itself, antimicrobial carpets and fabric could be installed and bathrooms could be modified for touch-free operation; shower curtains could be replaced with glass dividers.

Crew cabins

Koutsoukosta and her team haven't forgotten the crew members, who remain on board after passengers have disembarked. And due to the pandemic and complicated rules for repatriating workers to their home countries, there are still employees marooned on ships today waiting to be let off.

""With the well-being and safety of the crew in mind, cabins for the crew members can change in capacity or size so as to allow adequate self-distancing for the living quarters,"" Koutsoukosta said.

""In the cruise industry the number of passengers is closely tied to the number of crew members,"" said Koutsoukosta. ""Now, with the assumption that ships will be sailing with a reduced number of passengers, this will mean that the number of service personnel will be also reduced, as they will have to cater for less people.""

Because of that potential reduction, she imagines that crew cabins that hosted four individuals could be repurposed for two individuals and some cabins could be left unoccupied to be used in case of an emergency.

Dining areas

Dining on ships will likely change, as well. Koutsoukosta said that table sizing and spacing could be altered to ensure safe distancing between passengers and still provide enough room for staff to move about. Dividers could even be used to create separation at times if needed, she added.

The style of dining on board could change, too, including the popular buffet option. Some cruise line officials say that buffets could disappear entirely.

Frank Del Rio, CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, told USA TODAY in an interview that the buffet – a cruise ship mainstay – would probably not be offered anymore.

But Koutsoukosta doesn't necessarily believe buffets need to be eliminated entirely.

""The buffets layout can also change, with more counters as a solution to avoid long queues or even offering table service,"" she said.

Royal Caribbean president and CEO Michael Bayley indicated he thinks buffets can adapt, too.

""We’ve got teams working on every single element of the guest experience and we obviously have a team working on the buffet,"" he said during a Royal Caribbean ""coffee chat"" reported on by CruiseRadio.net.

Theaters

AMK told Cruise Industry News that theaters could be moved outdoors, to start.

""New open-air show theaters and disco areas, with weather-protection options, can give passengers indoor comfort and outdoor relaxation and security,"" Koutsoukosta explained to USA TODAY.

Schafer, the engineer, suggested that cruise lines ""utilize portable UVc lights or potentially fogging systems to sanitize high-occupancy spaces such as dining and entertainment areas."" (Electrostatic sprayers have also been used to disinfect the Diamond Princess and commercial airline cabins.)

Ask the Captain:What are airlines doing to sanitize planes and airports?

Swimming pools

While pools themselves will remain intact, surrounding areas can be reimagined, according to Koutsoukosta.

""To better understand how we can improve the surrounding areas, we must observe how the pools are used and for what function,"" she said.

In that vein, many passengers use the pool areas to tan and go into the pool only to cool themselves, she explained. An updated pool area design could include showers and other water features to provide alternatives and mitigate pool crowding.

""In addition to that, there are thoughts for passengers to book their slots in the pools, which will give them the added comfort of spaciousness,"" she said.

And cabanas could replace sun beds or deck chairs to promote social distancing on pool decks.

She also mentioned that they are evaluating the use of hot tubs.

Medical facilities

Onboard medical facilities also need to be upgraded as ships prepare to relaunch after coronavirus. In fact, Koutsoukosta said she believes they could become a ""differentiator"" as cruise lines compete to woo back customers.

It's likely, she said, that there will be increased space for medical facilities and cabins for medical crew that are separate from the rest of the crew.

""All medical-related facilities can be interlinked, and (at) the same time, isolated from the rest of the ship so as to separate medical operations from the public areas of the ship,"" Koutsoukosta said.

By having medical facilities separated from the rest of the ship, security and safety for doctors, nurses and patients alike would be increased, she explained. All health emergencies could be dealt with securely in one part of the ship while the fun could remain in tact on the rest of the ship.

How soon could these changes be implemented?

Koutsoukosta couldn't provide a timeline for when these safety upgrades might start appearing on cruise ships. She said AMK is currently consulting with one client and in talks with another, neither of which the company is able to identify.

""Anytime from a few weeks to a few months based on the extent to which of the vessels will be modified,"" she estimated. ""Again, after the feasibility studies, it’s a matter of decision by the cruise lines. Everybody right now is more or less testing the waters.""

Del Rio echoed Koutsoukosta's sentiment, predicting that the relaunching cruise ships, including Norwegian's own fleet of 28 ships, will involve trial and error.

""There will be fits and starts, and it will require the implementation of new protocols as we learn what works,"" he said.

Could changes be applied to ships already in service or only new vessels?

Koutsoukosta said it will be easier to implement complex changes to ships that are still on the drawing board or in preliminary stages of construction.

It's a little trickier to alter existing ships.

""There is really a certain limitation to the extent to which one can modify them quickly and in an economically viable way,"" she explained. ""What we try to do with our clients is focus on the vital-few solutions.""

Competition in the cruise industry has always been intense, Koutsoukosta added, and it will remain that way after coronavirus. And while sanitation upgrades aren't as grabby as onboard roller coasters or private islands, they will be necessary to compete.

""The changes that the cruise lines will make to their ships does not only improve their product offering, but it also puts them ahead of their competitors, as physical distancing, and hygiene is the new luxury,"" she said.

Hands reached through open windows and received bags stuffed with goodness. The faces were covered in masks, but you could almost see the smiles behind them.

“Thank you” in several languages could be heard as people accepted the food with gratitude.

One of the appreciative recipients was Pacoima resident Yahaira Fuentes. ” We are very grateful to everyone that are volunteering and giving away to the community,” said the car detailer, who has had almost no work since the stay at home orders were initiated and was happy for the help feeding her family.

Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez, chair of the city’s Public Safety Committee, handed out out food and wished people well as they received their bags.

“We have a great deal of need; I think that COVID-19 has daylighted for a lot of families what we knew to be true — that a lot of families are housing and food insecure,” she said. “So we are helping to provide all the resources they need to get through these difficult times.”

157,157,216,Jeff Bezos’ space company is pressuring employees to launch a tourist rocket during the pandemic,"Employees at Jeff Bezos’ aerospace firm Blue Origin are outraged that senior leadership is pressuring workers to conduct a test launch of the company’s New Shepard rocket — designed to take wealthy tourists into space — while the COVID-19 pandemic devastates the United States.

To conduct the flight, Blue Origin officials are considering transporting employees from the company’s main headquarters in Kent, Washington — a town near Seattle where COVID-19 cases have surged — to a small town in West Texas called Van Horn. The town, which has a population of just over 2,000, is home to Blue Origin’s test launch facility where the company has conducted all past flights of the New Shepard rocket.

Many employees fear that traveling to Van Horn might expose them to the novel coronavirus and inadvertently introduce COVID-19 to the residents of the rural town where there is very little infrastructure to handle an outbreak. The Verge spoke exclusively with four Blue Origin employees who all asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from the company. They say they are frustrated by the company’s desire to conduct a launch, as it could unnecessarily jeopardize the health of employees at Blue Origin and residents of Van Horn.

“It feels like the company is prioritizing its business goals and schedule above the safety of its employees and the community.”

“It feels like the company is prioritizing its business goals and schedule above the safety of its employees and the community,” one employee tells The Verge.

In a meeting with the New Shepard team on Wednesday, April 1st, Blue Origin leadership talked about ways to do a trip to Van Horn with a smaller group than usual and suggested that employees should keep a low profile while in town, according to a recording provided to The Verge. In the meeting, numerous employees voiced concerns about the trip, and one manager said there may be employment repercussions if they didn’t agree with management’s decisions.

“I would say that you should ask yourself, as an individual, are you acting as a toxin in the organization, fanning discontent, or are you really trying to help our senior leaders make better decisions?” Jeff Ashby, a senior mission assurance director at Blue Origin and a former NASA astronaut, said to employees during the meeting.

Blue Origin is one of a select group of companies still operating in the state of Washington. On March 23rd, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee issued a stay-at-home order and called for all nonessential businesses in Washington to close. But Blue Origin has remained operational, as the company has been deemed essential due to its work with the Department of Defense. The company is currently developing a much larger rocket called New Glenn, which is being considered by the US Air Force to launch future national security satellites. New Shepard, however, is primarily geared toward space tourism, designed to go to the edge of space and back during an 11-minute flight.

The company was originally targeting April 10th for the next New Shepard launch and was working toward that date as recently as last weekend, to the concern of multiple employees. Then on Sunday, March 29th, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott instituted a mandatory two-week self-quarantine for travelers coming from states with high numbers of COVID-19 cases, including Washington, forcing Blue Origin to put the flight on hold. The company then learned from the Texas governor’s office that Blue Origin employees could be exempt from the quarantine if traveling to conduct the launch. After learning of the exemption, Blue Origin conducted the meeting to discuss ways of moving forward, but a new launch date has not been set yet.

“What is essential about a vehicle that flies potentially billionaires to space?”

All of the employees who spoke with The Verge felt that New Shepard is not a critical vehicle that needs to launch during this time. “In my view, it’s really a stretch,” one employee tells The Verge. “I don’t think that New Shepherd is mission essential to the United States in any way.” While the rocket is sometimes used to carry research payloads, the primary focus of the vehicle is to eventually carry wealthy thrill-seekers to space where they’ll experience a few minutes of weightlessness.

“What is essential about a vehicle that flies potentially billionaires to space?” one employee asks.

In a response to The Verge, Blue Origin said it would not comment on internal meetings. The company maintains that it is continuing to monitor “this rapidly evolving situation” and that there is no launch date set yet. “We hold safety as our highest value. Period,” a spokesperson told The Verge in an email. “We are still operating at our West Texas Launch Site where we have been running engine tests and will continue to do so. Given our mission essential designation from Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, we’ve been cleared by federal, state and local officials to continue to operate, and we are doing everything we can to safeguard our workforce and communities.”

When the company was still moving ahead with the April 10th launch, multiple Blue Origin employees expressed concerns to their managers and even top-level leadership. They say that their frustrations are shared by many throughout the company. Despite this, Blue Origin officials continued to move ahead, asking employees if they would be comfortable traveling to Van Horn to conduct the launch.

Several people have expressed apprehension about going, according to employees interviewed by The Verge. They believe that it would be difficult to maintain proper social distancing and safety procedures if employees ultimately did have to go down to Van Horn. All employees have to stay in hotels while in the town, and they are typically crowded together in conference rooms or mission control to conduct the launch. In an email to the New Shepard team, a Blue Origin official noted that the company would be “modifying our launch procedures with a reduced set of flight objectives to accommodate a smaller deployment crew.” But the employees are skeptical that will keep people safe, and they still think people would need to be close together during the launch preparations.

In Wednesday’s meeting, one employee asked if there would be “employment repercussions” if they chose not to travel.

“The conversation has been had, to be honest with you, with HR and everybody else,” Doug Kunzman, senior director of New Shepard operations, said. “But as far as any kind of decision on that, no, I’ve been given no guidance yet on that outcome. We’re hoping that, you know, it doesn’t come to that, but it may and that’s why I was put on the table.” Ashby later clarified that employees who disagreed with senior leadership’s decisions wouldn’t necessarily be fired but that they did have “options.”

The New Shepard rocket scheduled to launch on this flight is the same vehicle that Blue Origin plans to use to conduct its first human test flights later this year. Employees worry that the company’s fixation on this deadline is resulting in unsafe decisions. Blue Origin’s primary competitor at the moment is Virgin Galactic, which has designed its own vehicle to take customers to the edge of space and back and has already sent some of its employees to space during two test launches. Neither company has started flying customers on its vehicles.

“There’s this insatiable drive to be the first.”

“There’s this insatiable drive to be the first,” one employee says. “We’re in a race.”

Other aerospace companies have made the decision to stand down from launches in response to the pandemic. California-based Rocket Lab has postponed its next flight out of New Zealand to protect its workforce. Launches have been suspended from Europe’s primary spaceport in South America as well. However, other rocket companies are still in operation. SpaceX and United Launch Alliance, for instance, are considered essential businesses and are still continuing work. SpaceX employees are still building the company’s giant Starship rocket down in Boca Chica, Texas, with plans to conduct some kind of tests in the coming weeks.

COVID-19 cases are continuing to rise in the United States, reaching more than 200,000 cases in the country. Around 30 states have issued “shelter-in-place” orders and closed nonessential businesses, while President Trump has extended social distancing guidelines until at least the end of April.

Currently, there are no confirmed cases in Culberson County, where Van Horn is located, according to Brenda Hinojos, the senior events coordinator for the town. She says that Blue Origin usually doesn’t say when it’s coming to Van Horn for launches, though the employees usually keep to themselves while visiting. However, she thinks a launch right now isn’t the best idea. “Right now really is not the time for them to be doing that,” Hinojos tells The Verge. “As of right now, even for them to come and eat and stay here, all our stuff — nothing’s open right now. Everything, you have to get it to go.” Van Horn only has a small clinic and hospital, and Hinojos says most patients are sent to El Paso or Odessa if they need serious care.

Meanwhile, some workers are already down in Van Horn performing maintenance on the New Shepard rocket. These full-time employees work multiple days in a row and then spend a set number of days at home with their families. Many of these workers don’t actually live in Van Horn but instead commute from other Texas towns or even areas outside of the state.

The employees in Kent expressed particular concern for these workers, as Blue Origin could let more of these long-distance commuters stay home if the company pushed back the launch date. “My biggest concern, flat out, is the sickness is spread by people traveling point to point. It can be reduced by people sheltering in place. We are doing the opposite of that. We are taking people to a location that is vulnerable and ill equipped to handle travelers at this time,” one employee says.

During the meeting, management suggested that these technicians could potentially lose their jobs if employees from Washington didn’t travel for the launch. “If we decide not to travel to Texas to do a flight, what happens to the technicians down there that operate the vehicle who no longer then have jobs?” Ashby asked. “Do they lose their jobs … because of our actions? I want us to be cognizant that our decisions don’t just affect us; they affect other people.”

“We work for the richest person on the planet.”

Many employees grew frustrated with that claim in the meeting. “That’s really irresponsible,” one employee replied. “We work for the richest person on the planet; he can afford to continue paying some technicians during this.”

Bezos has said that his “own time is now wholly focused on COVID-19” when it comes to his other company, Amazon, and he’s shared photos of his meetings with Inslee on Instagram.

Blue Origin employees say there is work they could do that doesn’t involve traveling to Texas during a pandemic, such as reviewing materials that will help qualify the vehicle for its first human passengers. “We could continue getting work done,” one employee says. “It might not be necessarily working toward a launch, but we have a backlog of other work that we could be doing right now.”

While the Blue Origin employees are particularly upset about the New Shepard launch, many expressed frustration over the company’s overall response to the pandemic so far. They say that Blue Origin was late to encourage people to work from home and that some people are still commuting to the office when they don’t need to. “There are also people who are coming in to just use the office because they prefer it to working from home,” one employee says.

Because of management’s actions, some say this is prompting them to want to find new jobs and that they’ve heard similar sentiments from their co-workers. “I feel really disgusted with the company right now and with our leadership,” says one employee.",1
1391,1398,1942,Trump’s Saturday Vacation Caught On Camera As Americans Die,"The United States is still in the throes of the Coronavirus pandemic. The country is quickly approaching a total of 100,000 deaths due to the virus, and tens of millions of people have filed for unemployment claims throughout recent weeks, indicating staggeringly sky-high unemployment rates. What’s the president of the United States doing this weekend while the crisis rages on? He’s golfing at a property branded with his own name.

Now that Trump has arrived at the golf course, we know why. https://t.co/Od29ODSUlW — Renato Mariotti (@renato_mariotti) May 23, 2020

After having stayed away from Trump-branded golf courses since all the way back in the beginning of March, President Donald Trump visited one of his golf courses in north Virginia this Saturday. NBC’s Kelly O’Donnell reported:

‘The president was spotted by pool in white hat, white shirt and the motorcade has left the WH compound. Could this be his first golf outing since early March during stay at Mar-A-Lago? More to come.’

And the president has arrived at his Sterling Virginia golf property. His first visit to a Trump branded course since March 8th. https://t.co/Ar4w3HPfRO — Kelly O'Donnell (@KellyO) May 23, 2020

Indeed — the trip was apparently not announced ahead of time, but yes, Trump ended up visiting one of his golf courses this Saturday morning. The Trump Organization started the process of reopening their golf courses in early May. They’d been closed amidst the national social distancing demands meant to help stem the spread of the Coronavirus. Trump has consistently seemed eager to lift those social distancing demands, no matter the potential ensuing negative effects on public health — and it’s definitely not beyond the current president for concern about getting back on the golf course to have driven his eagerness to dismiss public health guidelines. At one point, he even tweeted that his followers should “liberate” certain states that were under stay-at-home guidelines — including the state of Virginia, where his golf course that he visited this weekend is located.

Condemnation for the president promptly poured in. As political commentator Jon Favreau put it:

‘Trump won’t do anything else to stop a virus that’s killed 100,000 Americans. He won’t do anything else to fix an economy where 40 million are out of work. He will golf, though!’

38,38,71,Activists pick up their phones and move online as coronavirus curbs protests,"Activists prepping for a rally that was supposed to take place yesterday on Wall Street thought they were being careful. They would stand a few feet away from each other while protesting a potential bailout for fossil fuel companies amid the economic disaster unfolding along with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Then came a flood of unexpected news the evening before the protest: classes were canceled to keep people from passing the virus to one another, President Trump announced a travel ban, Tom Hanks became the first A-list celebrity to test positive for the virus. The last straw for the activists was the NBA suspending its season.

Mass protests are indefinitely on hold

“That was a big shocker to some of us who are big sports fans,” says Pete Sikora, climate campaigns director for New York Communities for Change, an advocacy group leading the protest. “That drove home how big a deal this is.” So they canceled, about 12 hours before the rally was set to start.

Mass protests are indefinitely on hold, some grassroots groups say, amid efforts to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. Groups like the Sunrise Movement — which had also planned to join the Wall Street rally — are turning to online activism and phone banking to keep momentum going. Sunrise, which has pushed for a Green New Deal by occupying the offices of ranking Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, tells The Verge that it is postponing all of its mass mobilizations and in-person trainings until further notice.

The restrictions come at a crucial time when many community organizers would normally be in full gear. It’s election season, so they’re working to mobilize voters and sway presidential candidates’ positions. There’s also distrust in the Trump administration’s ability to respond to the crisis. During previous disasters like hurricanes, people have been able to express their frustration with a botched response through protests. But the coronavirus pandemic means that doing the same now could do more harm than good. And some activists worry that the public health crisis will make situations worse for the communities they represent.

“The thing that really kind of captures public outrage is mass protests in the streets and so we’re going to be fighting with one hand tied behind our back,” says Sikora, whose organization also works on housing and criminal justice reform.

His group is figuring out ways to protect New Yorkers who might be disproportionately vulnerable to the pandemic and its economic fallout. As businesses slow and lay off workers, there’s more pressure on people trying to make ends meet. New York Communities for Change wants to stop evictions in the state so that people aren’t thrown out of their homes at a time when they’re supposed to stay home to keep healthy. It’s also calling for pardons or sentence reductions for elderly inmates, since prisons are susceptible to outbreaks and seniors inside could be sitting ducks.

Here's the thing, y'all. #coronavirus and #COVID19 are an #environmentaljustice issue. Where do you think thousands of elders with compromised immune systems, respiratory and heart diseases, and other so-called ""co-morbidities"" caused by pollution + racism w ""higher risk"" live? — Juliana Pino ️‍ (@julianapino) March 11, 2020

Sikora says his organization has been puzzling its way through the rapidly changing situation just like everyone else. They might turn to online petitions and webinars, or will ask people to take pictures to post online as a form of protest. The group’s office has temporarily closed and its staff are working remotely starting today.

The Sunrise Movement is asking people stuck at home to use their time to call prospective voters. They’re trying to turn out votes for congressional candidates that they’ve endorsed in the Midwest. They’re also campaigning hard for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who has championed a Green New Deal. With Joe Biden now ahead of Sanders, it’s crunch time for the next round of Democratic primaries on March 17th.

Sunrise had put their hopes in college students boosting their candidates — but those students may not be on campus now that classes have been suspended. To get young voters to the polls, Sunrise is organizing phone banks; they’re also floating the idea of coordinating video conferences so that they can still sort of be together while making calls separately from home. It’s a shift in strategy from their previous focus on talking with people as they knocked door to door.

it’s crunch time

“Of course it is more difficult to mobilize in person for the Green New Deal because we need to take care of each other in this moment, not exposing each other to unnecessary risk,” says Sofie Karasek, a spokesperson for Sunrise. Making the call not to move forward with public rallies was an “emotionally difficult decision, especially when people put so much hard work into making these mobilizations happen and preparing.”

A major 3-day strike coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Earth Day in April will no longer take place — at least not in person — a coalition of environmental groups announced this afternoon. “Instead, we will think creatively about how to disrupt business as usual,” the coalition tweeted.

Greta Thunberg, who inspired youth around the world to demand action on climate change by hitting the streets, tweeted earlier this week asking people to stay home. “Keep your numbers low but your spirits high and let’s take one week at the time,” she said. Thunberg urged people to join a digital strike by posting photos online with the hashtag #ClimateStrikeOnline. The call has already been met with a flood of young people posting photos with protest signs from their homes.

following the guidelines of @WHO and not taking to the streets in larger crowds. but we want to keep the momentum going and so have created #ClimateStrikeOnline

Other groups are still figuring out how to navigate the new realities of living through a pandemic. “No decisions have been made yet but the organization is taking [COVID-19] very seriously,” a spokesperson for March For Our Lives, the youth gun violence prevention movement sparked by the Parkland, Florida high school shooting, emailed The Verge. “We are developing a plan on how to move forward with our planned demonstrations, digital activism, and working with our various members and chapters across the country to ensure we continue to work towards ending gun violence in America,” the spokesperson said.

106,106,153,SpaceX is making its own hand sanitizer and building face shields to donate to fight coronavirus,"SpaceX is manufacturing its own hand sanitizer and face shields with plans to donate the materials to hospitals and places in need to help fight the novel coronavirus pandemic, according to an internal memo first reported by CNBC and seen by The Verge. The company also plans to host a voluntary blood drive at its headquarters in Hawthorne, California, and is looking into setting up drives at other SpaceX locations.

The email, sent to SpaceX employees, claims that the home-brewed hand sanitizer made by the facilities, materials engineering, and health and safety teams “complies with CDC guidelines and is effective at killing COVID-19.” The face shields are being manufactured by the same team that builds space suits and crew equipment. So far, engineers made up to 75 masks over the weekend and donated them to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to the email. The team also donated 100 Tyvek coverall suits to medical staff there. Neither Cedars-Sinai Medical Center nor SpaceX immediately responded to a request for comment about the donations.

The memo also addresses ways that the company is helping out its employees during the pandemic. For example, all food outlets at SpaceX sites are cutting their food prices in half, and the company is now letting hourly employees scan their badges to clock their hours rather than use a fingerprint scanner.

SpaceX claims its hand sanitizer “complies with CDC guidelines and is effective at killing COVID-19.”

The memo, which shows support for health care workers and others in the midst of the crisis, comes just a few weeks after the company’s CEO Elon Musk made light of the pandemic. Originally, Musk said the panic surrounding COVID-19 was dumb and repeatedly tried to downplay the seriousness of the disease, telling employees in an email that they were more likely to die in a car crash than from the virus. Now, two SpaceX workers have tested positive for COVID-19, while another dozen are in quarantine. Employees at the company’s in-house school have expressed concern for their safety as they’ve been required to come into work during the pandemic, according to a report from BuzzFeed.

In the weeks since, Musk has offered to use his companies to help support patients and those fighting the pandemic. His other company, Tesla, recently bought 1,000 surplus ventilators from China and donated them to the state of California. Tesla also sent up to 50,000 N95 surgical masks to the University of Washington’s Medical Center. Meanwhile, Tesla is working with the medical device company Medtronic to start producing ventilators to help hospitals facing potential shortages as more COVID-19 patients require oxygen. Musk noted on Twitter that Tesla’s Gigafactory in New York would open “as soon as humanly possible” to start ventilator production to help the state.

Other companies, like Ford, GM, Apple, and Facebook, have also been trying to help the country’s strained health care system by donating or making desperately needed medical supplies as the pandemic worsens throughout the US.",1

Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP

President Trump asked Americans during Monday's coronavirus briefing to maintain their social distancing through the end of the month to bring the coronavirus under control.

And if people really do observe the stay-at-home orders, models suggest that the epidemic could wane by summer. There's also hope that the changing weather will help slow the spread of the virus, though that's far from certain.

But there's a problem. Even if things ""get better all of a sudden,"" as the president suggested he hoped would happen, the virus will not have gone away.

""This virus is now in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of locations around the world,"" said Mark Denison, director of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""And it's not finished with its human exploration.""

Not that the virus is intentionally exploring, it's just doing what viruses do: infecting cells and making copies of itself. That doesn't happen when enough people are immune from infection, either because people have been exposed to the virus, and recovered, or because they've been vaccinated.

Virologists call people who don't have that immunity ""naïve."" Their immune system hasn't learned how to deal with the threat the virus represents.

""This virus has about 8 billion immune-naive people on the planet,"" said Denison. He worries that the virus could easily flare up again once people start going back to work and restarting their accustomed activities.

""This thing is scaring the hell out of me,"" said Denison.

""When the virus is gone, people are going to sit next to each other,"" Trump said, at sporting events and restaurants. But that may be farther off than the president thinks.

The best protection against the virus would be a vaccine. But that's probably at least a year away, even if the crash development programs now underway succeed.

Still, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it may be possible to loosen societal restrictions sooner. ""I don't think that you're going to have to say that the country cannot get back to a real degree of normalcy until you absolutely have a safe and effective vaccine,"" he said during the briefing.

A test that measures people's antibodies, and presumably their immunity, to the virus will be available widely by May, according to U.S. Public Health Service Adm. Brett Giroir.

That kind of test will be ""so important,"" Fauci said, because then health officials will know how widely the virus has spread.

Broader testing capability, including antibody testing, would help the country reduce the kind of COVID-19 mitigation by social distancing that is in effect now. ""We will have in place the capability of identifying [cases], contact tracing and isolating so it never gets out of hand,"" he said.",1
1105,1105,1331,“Can’t Pay May”: Making Rent in New York City During the Pandemic,"In mid-March, many landlords began sending nervous reminders that rent was still due on April 1st, as if tenants might forget. Some landlords have expressed a sense of aggrieved betrayal at tenants who have not paid their rents; on Facebook groups such as “ACTION: New York City Rent Strike,” which has more than four thousand members, tenants have posted screenshots of increasingly infuriated e-mails and text messages. One tenant posted about a landlord who threatened retaliation on the family car, another reported that a landlord claims the building is “not eligible” for the eviction freeze. Other landlords have encouraged tenants to sign rent-deferral agreements, in which the tenant agrees to add the unpaid rent onto future rent payments. Some landlords have reminded tenants of their own bills; they have suggested that tenants could get jobs at Amazon or at grocery stores. They have encouraged tenants to charge their rent to a credit card, or to set up automatic debits.

If some landlords seem to be in denial about the inevitable effects of mass unemployment, Eric Kober, who was the director of housing, economic, and infrastructure planning at the New York Department of City Planning from 1991 to 2017, suggests they look to the seventies, when population loss and lack of financing resulted in large swathes of dilapidated and abandoned housing stock. “Ultimately, the system is capitalized,” Kober explained. “There needs to be cash flow in the system to keep it going.” If renters cannot pay and landlords get into financial trouble, buildings end up deteriorating. If the landlords default, banks, which have historically been bad at property management, end up owning buildings, and housing conditions worsen further. Property-tax revenue falls. Kober described it as a “downward spiral” that, in the past, has only halted when the government has provided low-cost loans or appointed emergency managers. When the government itself experiences a financial shortfall, as New York will, such financing becomes difficult to come by.

After losing eight hundred thousand residents in the nineteen-seventies, the city’s population grew in the nineties, swelling by approximately a million people, without an equivalent increase in housing construction. But Kober corrected the idea I had seen circulating that people leaving New York as a result of the pandemic might make the city more comfortable for the middle class. “The only way the population goes down is if the city ceases to be a beacon of opportunity, which would be a terrible loss for New York and for the entire country,” he said. He recalled moving to the city in 1980, when it was “dirty, rundown, and just generally unappealing” because of poorly funded services and infrastructure. If the city faces a similar fiscal crisis, he said, “it will be cheaper for the middle class to find housing in the city, but they won’t want to be here.”

Durante (Danny) Galeotafiore is perhaps a typical example of a New York landlord who has enjoyed the city’s several-decade run of prosperity. He moved to New York City from Naples, Italy, in 1976, opened Danny’s Pizza, off the Montrose L stop, in 1983, and bought his first building in Williamsburg in 1992. After a few years of high crime rates, the neighborhood boomed. He now owns five buildings in Williamsburg and in Ridgewood, Queens, with fourteen residential and commercial units. His last rent-controlled tenant, an eighty-five-year-old woman, pays seven hundred and fifty dollars a month in a building where everyone else pays twenty-five hundred. Since the lockdown, most of his tenants have paid their rents as usual, but some—a hair stylist, a bartender—have come calling. He has given them discounts, but chastises them for not having savings.

The thought that the city might not continue its inexorable rise toward higher prices seemed unthinkable to him. “They’re building left and right,” he said to me. “Everywhere, there’s no more parking spaces! Everywhere, nothing is for sale, everything is taken. ” He envisions that the impact of the coronavirus will be more like that of 9/11, when the market took a brief dip and then bounced back, than the kind of exodus that New York City saw in the seventies. “Where are they going to go, back home?” he asked me of his tenants. “Nobody wants to go back home. Do you want to go back to Minneapolis?”

I didn’t think so, but I first moved here in 2003—I only know the gentrified New York of low crime and delicious coffee. Until last month, the reasons I thought about leaving were all related to real estate: the instability of renting, the dream of buying an affordable house, “nature.” Before the pandemic, I was contemplating giving up my rental apartment, on the border of Bushwick and Bed-Stuy, to look for something cheaper in 2021. I love my apartment, a spacious fourth-floor walkup in a prewar building, and have no desire to move, but the rent keeps going up. In the seventies, the area had lost thirty per cent of its populations and, in fires after the 1977 blackout, dozens of buildings. All of that was hard to imagine now, as successive waves of gentrification, of people like me moving in, seemed only to accelerate. The dry cleaner shut, then the coffee shop—profitable businesses killed by landlords who thought that they could do better. Both storefronts are empty now. A Starbucks opened down the street. I watched as expensive restaurants and bars opened, and then failed. I lived in Miami during the real-estate bubble of the mid-two-thousands, and I saw some of the same signs in the hastily built condos that popped up like mushrooms, the profit motive evident in their low ceilings and cramped bedrooms, the reigning architectural theory seemingly that, if a window is big enough, you won’t notice that you’re living in a place inimical to the resident’s well-being. The Google reviews of these new developments had tenants complaining about sound carrying through thin walls, weed smoke wafting through the entire building, the promised bike room that never materialized. The landlords seemed to imagine an apparently endless supply of rootless young professionals; you rarely saw ads targeted toward the families such buildings displaced.

The truth is, I do maintain a little Zillow file of houses in Minneapolis, where I grew up, where you can buy a cute two-bedroom house in a city with progressive politics for hundreds of thousands of dollars less than a one-bedroom apartment in Bushwick. I have no plans to leave, and I don’t need my own washing machine or my own lawn, but I like to fantasize about having a home with relatively fixed long-term costs that I could plan a life around. For decades, the reigning philosophy of New York politics has been that the state and city governments should encourage real-estate development but not rent regulation. Politicians, including Mayor Bill de Blasio, were just starting to murmur about introducing some kind of universal rent control when the pandemic hit. After years in which small-business owners and the middle class accepted insecurity as the price of living in the paradise of New York City, are landlords about to get a reckoning?

It’s too early to tell the long-term effect of the pandemic on the rental market. Rents in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn were at record highs as March began, according to StreetEasy, but the number of new listings dropped by fifty-two per cent in the second half of March. The exception was short-term rentals, listings for which rose by seventy per cent compared to the same time last year, as uncertain renters showed a preference for more flexibility. Since the pandemic began, my social-media feeds have been full of the politics of staying or leaving. The well-to-do have retreated to their hill stations, and recriminations about public health from those without the means to leave themselves come with a side of envy. I lurk on a Facebook sublet group primarily used by people who identify as “digital nomads,” who, now “stuck” in Tulum, Hawaii, or Bali, are trying to off-load their New York apartments with an urgency that recalls the evacuation of the Pieds-Noirs on the verge of Algerian independence—seeking recommendations for movers who can pack up their places in absentia, looking for someone to take over their leases and buy all their Restoration Hardware furniture. It’s unclear whether these people ever really lived in New York, or just sustained a circular Airbnb economy; it’s equally unclear if what would be devastating for the fortunes of SoulCycle and Sweetgreen would be so bad for New York City. But, speaking purely anecdotally, a lot of people seem to be leaving town, especially young people who can ride out the quarantine with their parents, and the wealthy, who, according to news reports, are rushing to rent houses in the suburbs and upstate. The June crop of college grads will not arrive this year. Trump has halted immigration. If the city is going to lose people, it will need to help the ones who stay.",1
93,93,140,Bandsintown will help musicians get faster access to Twitch monetization,"Concert notification service Bandsintown has partnered with Twitch to help out artists who are unable to tour because of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The partnership lets qualified Bandsintown artists bypass the normal qualifications needed to become a Twitch Affiliate and get fast access to the live streaming platform’s monetization tools.

Canceled events are a blow to musicians who depend on income from live shows, and many have turned to “quaranstreams” to try and alleviate the financial damage. SoundCloud recently announced a similar initiative with Twitch.

Bandsintown artists with 2,000 trackers or more are eligible to apply. You’ll then have to create a Twitch channel, link it on your artist profile on the platform, and fill out a short form. (It’s linked in Bandsintown’s post.) Once submitted, the company says Twitch’s Affiliation program will contact you by email within two to five business days to get any other details needed to upgrade your account.

with tours canceled, many musicians have started “quaranstreams”

Affiliate status on Twitch unlocks monetization tools, like subscriptions and the ability to receive tips. Getting fast Affiliate approval can help out artists who need to create additional income now, with swaths of the entertainment industry ground to a halt as a result of the pandemic.

Normally, in order to qualify for Affiliate status, a Twitch user must have at least 50 followers along with at least 500 total broadcast minutes in the last 30 days, seven unique broadcast days in the last 30 days, and an average of three concurrent viewers or more in the last 30 days. This program, like the one between Twitch and SoundCloud, lets artists bypass these hurdles so they can monetize on Twitch within days.

”Twitch continues to be a great place for artists to perform and connect with their fans live,” said Mike Olson, Twitch’s head of music, said in a statement. “We’re excited to partner with Bandsintown to provide artists not only the best live streaming experience, but an opportunity for our community to support them with monetization tools that aren’t offered elsewhere.”

Bandsintown also recently launched its own Twitch channel and added the ability to push out a “watch live” notification when musicians are live-streaming shows. These notifications will show up on Bandsintown, as well as Facebook pages and anywhere else Bandsintown listings appear.",1
39,39,72,Coronavirus in Europe: Live data tracker,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1

For the past two weeks, Nathan Tetreault of Lillian, Ala., has suffered through likely COVID-19 symptoms: dry cough, fever, waking up in the middle of the night struggling to breathe.

""I don't know if I have it. However, chances are pretty darn likely,"" Tetreault says.

Doctors wouldn't test him last week because he didn't meet the required criteria early on: He's not someone who's over 65 and showing symptoms, and he hasn't traveled outside the U.S. or come into contact with anyone he knows of who has tested positive.

National Coronavirus Testing Capacity Remains A Problem Nationwide Coronavirus Testing Capacity Remains A Problem Nationwide Listen · 7:30 7:30

""The scariest thing is not getting answers, not knowing what's gonna happen when you call the doctor and they're just like, 'Yeah, you're on your own,' "" he says.

Tetreault is now feeling better. He's supposed to go back to his job at a supermarket. But he's worried he could be infectious. He says if he knew he was positive, he could ask for more time off.

There's still a serious shortage of testing for COVID-19 across the U.S., in spite of President Trump insisting the situation is improving. While COVID-19 testing criteria can vary depending on where you live, tests are being rationed in every state. Demand is far outstripping capacity from Alabama to Oregon.

In Portland, Ore., Melissa Burgess, her husband and their 1 1/2-year-old son have been holed up in their small house for two weeks. She had mild symptoms. Her husband, though, got much sicker — but not bad enough to go to the emergency room or get a test, according to their doctor.

Fortunately, his health is improving.

""And so maybe it wasn't that, and thank God, but the anxiety in the past few days has been pretty high,"" Burgess says.

Still, Burgess isn't taking any chances. She wears the family's one mask — they got it from a neighbor — when she cares for her husband. They're worried that if she gets sick, there will be nobody to take care of their son. Her parents live nearby and usually they'd help out, but they can't come over and risk getting sick.

""The point being, if everyone was able to just get a test, to know if they had it or not, then we could at least have comfort in knowing that someone could take care of our son,"" Burgess says.

People who responded to NPR's call-out on social media were frustrated that testing is still being rationed and not everyone who's showing symptoms can get one.

Betsy Larrabee of Longmont, Colo., said her husband is sick with many symptoms of COVID-19. Their son has leukemia, and yet their doctor said the only thing they could do for now is to isolate at home.

""How is that sound medical advice? Especially with a highly contagious disease, once both parents go down with it,"" she says. ""We had no choice but to expose our kids and pray for the best.""

There are signs that testing is becoming more widely available, with some caveats.

Idaho's Blaine County, home to the Sun Valley Resort, has reported some of the highest rates of COVID-19 in the United States. A woman there in her 30s was able to get tested. But because she wasn't that sick, her swab was sent to a commercial lab. She got the positive result 12 days later.

""We've never had sufficient test capacity from the beginning of this ordeal,"" says Abner King, CEO of Syringa Hospital & Clinics in rural northern Idaho.

Most of its tests are sent to a commercial lab in California, which has its own backlog to deal with.

""We have a lot of people that want to get tested and that are upset when the screening criteria says, no, you don't qualify to get tested,"" King says. ""They'll literally go to the next hospital down the road and try there, but we're all in the same boat.""

King just hopes people in his community who think they might be sick are heeding Idaho's stay-at-home order. That's not of much solace to people such as Melissa Burgess and her family next door in Oregon.

Burgess, however, stresses that she lays no blame on local physicians and health care staff.

""They are working so hard,"" she says. ""They're in a hard position to have to tell people, no, we can't prescribe you a test right now because there aren't enough.""",1
237,237,311,"Clashing over coronavirus is new source of household tension, fighting","Remember those good old days when the main source of tension in your household might have been politics? Forget that. Now it’s all about coronavirus.

Just what we need: A new source of family division as we clash over how to properly respond to a killer pandemic when millions of American families are shut in for maybe months and already getting on each other’s nerves.

Your spouse thinks it’s safe to eat with friends on the patio; you think it should be home-cooked meals with family only. But the kids want to go to the lake house and get takeout every day. You drop off groceries for the grandparents, while they keep going to Costco just because they’re bored. And they’re pressing to see the kids, never mind social distancing.

By now, you may be fighting over who gets to walk the dog just so you can get the heck out of Dodge.

Brandi Cypher, a Seattle mother of two boys, is managing lockdown with her ex-husband who lives in a different house. Both are working from home, and communicate amicably by text and phone.

“I did not agree that his parents should come in to town, with Seattle being the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak at the time,” she says. “He did not think that I should have my friend, who also cuts my hair, come to my house even though she had been in quarantine for several weeks. These are new kinds of disagreements that have come up with coronavirus, and do cause some tension.”

Many of us might be thinking we need a family therapist about now. In fact, sociologists, psychologists, therapists and relationship trainers say they are already hearing from clients and patients, even though no one is actually seeing them in person (it’s taking place by phone or online via video links).

“They won’t apply the words, ‘it’s because of the virus or the pandemic that I’m feeling this way,’ “ says Mandy Mitchell, a licensed clinical social worker at the Center for Counseling and Wellness in Myrtle Beach, S.C. ”Instead, they say, ‘I wanted him to buy seven cans of corn and he only bought three’ and they think they’re arguing about corn when what they’re really arguing about is the need to feel secure and stable.”

All families have underlying issues; in times like these, they’re exacerbated or easily triggered, thus launching potentially toxic interactions, says family therapist Helen Park of Manhattan’s Ackerman Institute for the Family, a mental-health clinic.

“It’s just so much more pronounced now because the climate for everybody is such an acute, pervasive level of anxiety,” Park says. “That kicks up the sympathetic nervous system; the fight-or-flight fear responses are very much always on. That’s where you get problematic cycles of interactions, which are so difficult to interrupt if you’re in a heightened state.”

Indeed, American households are dealing with a whole new level of fraught these days, one that makes the usual squabbling seem tame.

Elizabeth Tenety, a co-founder of and occasional columnist on the popular parenting site Motherly.com, says she’s noticed how virus lockdown is affecting her own family; she and her husband are the parents of four kids under 7, and both are working from their New Jersey home.

“A week or two ago, I just attacked my husband — I had what I now understand, after a lot of reporting and writing about it, was a natural human reaction to so much uncertainty and terror,” says Tenety, co-author of “The Motherly Guide to Becoming Mama.”

“I’m trying to cope with demands, he’s not coping the way I want him to be coping, and I handled it in the worst way, very accusatory,” Tenety says. “We’re hearing from our audience there are thousands of women saying ‘me, too, I’m fighting with my partner’ more.”

Stacey Engle, president of Fierce Conversations, a Seattle-based corporate training and coaching firm (based on a self-help book of the same name), says her company trains people on how to have “better conversations” aimed at listening and communicating with less rancor. Now that they’re delivering their training online to couples and families, they’re advising clients that existing tensions can be resolved or ameliorated before relationships become irreparable, Engle says.

“Because a core idea is that the conversation IS the relationship,” Engle says. “If you want an open, loving relationship, you need to have the same in conversations.”

Teaching people “the skill of listening to understand rather than to form your rebuttal” is the aim of the Seattle-based Gottman Institute, which preaches a research-based approach to relationships and trains certified therapists like Mitchell. She says she’s seeing an increase in conflict among her clients they hadn’t experienced since they started therapy.

”It might look like anger but it’s really just fear, because that’s a very primal part of us as human beings,” she says. She tries to help people learn to dial down accusatory and aggressive interactions. “How do you approach any subject in a way that is gentle and kind and shows what we call unconditional positive regard, meaning: I love you no matter what.”

Even in the best of times, it takes work to consciously de-escalate tensions or remember to just check in regularly with each other, says Tenety. She and her husband have arranged an ad hoc shift system to give each time off from dealing with kids, school, household chores and work during quarantine.

“We’re hearing this a lot from the parenting community, about being as empathetic and generous with your partner as you would want him or her to be with you,” says Tenety. “I’m so fried at the end of the day, I am going to bed early but my husband is staying up and working on his garden, so I give him the space he needs to cope, and I get the space I need to sleep.”

Tziporah Rosenberg, an associate professor in the Departments of Psychiatry & Family Medicine at the University of Rochester medical school.

“If they avoided hard conversations or fought over every difference before, you can reasonably expect that’s how they’re handling things now,” Rosenberg says. “For most people, it’s not the time to hatch brand new skills.”

And it does take skills to cope when the anxiety meter is soaring because of fear.

“When we’re fearful we’re not operating at our best,” Rosenberg says. “We’re operating out of survival instincts and there’s not a lot of room for empathy, compassion, patience, listening deeply — those are higher-level skills.”

So what can be done? It’s not like you can flounce out of the house in a huff.

Engle suggests taking a straightforward approach: Address and talk about whatever needs to be talked about in a non-confrontational way.

“If there are issues occurring or bothering you, you have to name it, get clear about it and why is this an issue, and get more clarity to prepare to have a conversation with whoever is involved,” Engle says. “You’re addressing issues with a person alongside a person, it’s not confronting a person.”

In the midst of an argument, remember to hit the “pause” button, says Rosenberg.

“We’ve recommended this for years, (that) when couples get into arguments, blow the whistle and take a time out,” she says. “Go to mutual corners and revisit the conversation a half-hour later. It takes our brains at least that long to come down from agitation.”

That time-tested technique is even more relevant now, says Engle. “In this time, you have the opportunity more than ever to pause, reflect and connect with the people you live with in new and meaningful ways,” she says.

Try self-soothing and self-care techniques. Take a yoga class online or learn to meditate via an online course. Look for a celebrity workout routine on Instagram and try it. (Check out Jane Fonda’s on TikTok.) Lose yourself in a book, work in the garden or even take a nap.

Kirsten Ngheim, who lives with her husband and two young sons on Bainbridge Island, Wash., says so far she and her husband are in harmony about their lives in lockdown, and maybe it’s because she’s focused on her garden in trying to prepare for the unknown.

“I’m thinking more about planting foods that grow plentifully, further reducing the need for store runs,” she says. “But I’m also planting lots of flowers, which evoke an appreciation for nature, happiness, and love just by seeing them. Creating joy in beauty (and) inspiring mental health.”

Another thing to remember is that a therapist is only a video link away. “One of the great things is that there are all these resources for self-care so readily accessible online,” Park says. “Normally these workshops or retreats, you have to show up in person and pay a lot of money. Now they’re free online.”

Cypher says she tries to focus on the positive aspects of her situation in Seattle. Not being in the same house with her ex makes things easier, she says.

“We don’t have constant exposure to one another so in that sense we aren’t getting on each other’s nerves the way some folks who share a home probably are,” she notes. “As this continues, I’m sure other issues will come up but fortunately thus far, it’s been relatively smooth.”

It might help to remember that millions of families are struggling to cope, too. You can tell because people are talking about it online and on social media. Or joking about it.

“Thank God, my wife has multiple personalities. I’m quarantined with a different person everyday and its not boring at all,” joshed Paul Barbar.

“Is this a tension headache caused by my friends and family still not taking this pandemic seriously, or am I just coming down with the novel coronavirus: a fun, daily question!” tweeted Tiffany C. Li, an attorney and legal scholar.

Even America’s celebrity sweethearts want to throttle each other. Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard, married since 2013 and parents of two young daughters, openly admitted it in a video interview with Katie Couric last month.

As the lovey-dovey couple sat next to each for the video, the tension was obvious on camera.

“This is as physically close as we’ve been in a couple of days ‘cause we’ve just found each other revolting,” Bell said, sharing they had been “at each other’s throats real bad.”

421,421,518,It’s impossible to count everyone with COVID-19,"Zack Moore, state epidemiologist in North Carolina, can’t say how many people in the state have COVID-19. He knows how many people test positive for the coronavirus each day, and how many people are in the hospitals across the state, and how many people go to the emergency room with an illness that could be COVID-19. None of those numbers alone pins down how many people are infected. But together, they help sketch an outline of the pandemic.

“It’s never about one single data source. Every source of data is helpful, but they all have their own limitations. So it’s about using them together,” he says.

There’s no way for public health experts to actually count every single person who has any illness at a given time, even well-known illnesses like the flu. Instead, they combine different sources of data to make the best-possible estimate of what disease outbreaks look like. The goal is to understand the virus well enough to make those estimates as accurate as possible.

“People think we know how many people had the flu every year, and we don’t,” Moore says. “We have to use these surveillance tools and indirect measures to get a full understanding.”

Public health officials are measuring the COVID-19 pandemic in a handful of ways. The number of positive test results is an important one, says John Brownstein, an infectious disease epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital. “That data is incredibly valuable, because it’s confirmed illnesses,” he says. But it’s an imperfect tool because most communities in the United States don’t have enough tests available to test everyone who feels sick.

Because everyone who’s sick won’t get a test, experts also look to data collected by hospitals on the people who show up to an emergency room with symptoms of COVID-19. Those measurements also have limitations because many people who have these symptoms might just have the flu or another type of respiratory disease. This approach also misses people who may feel sick but don’t feel sick enough to go to the hospital.

Zooming out even further, some researchers (including Brownstein) have developed programs that ask people to report how they’re feeling each day. They hope that the data will help reveal hotspots where people are starting to feel sick but aren’t getting tested for COVID-19 yet. Another big-picture strategy is measuring levels of the coronavirus in sewage to predict how many people in a community are infected. Antibody tests, which can check if someone was exposed to the virus in the past, are also critical tools. They can help find people who never felt sick and so wouldn’t be caught by any of the surveillance methods that screen for symptoms.

Severe lack of #COVID19 testing means we need alternate methods to understand community transmission.



We are launching @COVIDNearYou crowdsourcing platform. Take a few seconds to report your symptoms and help us build a national picture of #coronavirus.https://t.co/2g1hyMQldW pic.twitter.com/mhIY9VnnGM — John Brownstein (@johnbrownstein) March 22, 2020

“We’re constantly trying to bring together different pieces of information, and it all provides a different lens on an outbreak,” Brownstein says.

In North Carolina, Moore looks at all of their data sources daily and weekly and focuses on the trends in that data. If the number of people coming to the emergency room with symptoms of COVID-19 is going down, but the hospitalization rate and number of positive test results are still going up, it might just mean that people are avoiding the emergency room — not that fewer people are sick. “It has to be viewed in the bigger context,” he says. “The trends are what we’re focused on, because that’s what helps us in terms of making decisions about control measures.”

Moore says they’re looking closely at the surveillance tools they’re not already using to see what might be a useful addition to their data sets. “We want to understand whether they’re really value added,” he says. “We don’t want to create more noise — surveillance can already be confusing enough.”

Ongoing research on the virus and how it spreads also help experts figure out the best way to interpret the data they’re collecting. Studies that collect blood samples to test for antibodies in segments of the population, for example, will help identify the percentage of people who catch the coronavirus without ever feeling sick. With that data, public health officials will be able to more accurately estimate the number of people who actually have the virus using the information they gather on people who report symptoms. Moore says he uses an iceberg metaphor: “What we can see is the people who come out and seek medical care. The part under the water is the people who don’t, who we need to learn more about.”

With well-known diseases, public health experts can look at the number of confirmed cases and predict how many cases went undetected. “When we see a single case of hepatitis C, I can tell you pretty confidently that there were 14 other people who probably also had it and weren’t identified,” Moore says. “We’re trying to get that level of understanding for COVID-19.”

Brownstein thinks we’re getting closer. “The further this goes on, the more we’ll be able to get a better estimate.”",1
922,922,1096,What will hotel visits be like? Here's your room-by-room look at the future,"Hotels are cautiously reopening for the summer travel season, but it's anything but business as usual in the hospitality industry. Last week, the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) introduced its Safe Stay guidelines developed under the guidance of an advisory council that includes Accor, InterContinental Hotels Group, Marriot International, Omni Hotels & Resorts and Walt Disney. Now, the health and cleaning guidelines are being adopted by thousands of hotels, with many choosing to go beyond its recommendations.

Getting to your hotel

Arriving by air? There's a chance your hotel has started cleaning the area around you before you're even left the airport. Sandals Resorts identified 18 key touch points — or points of high contact — for extra cleaning, starting with airport lounges and vehicle transfers. Many hotels are increasing the frequency of airport transfers to reduce the number of passengers in each vehicle too.

Dallas's Hotel Crescent Court is suspending valet services for the foreseeable future. Courtesy of Hotel Crescent Court

If you're arriving via your own car, don't assume a valet team will be waiting out front, as many hotels like the Hotel Crescent Court in Dallas, Texas are suspending the service. Other hotels are keeping it and disinfecting the vehicle between drivers. Bell hops — where are the bell hops? Be prepared to carry your own bags. Camelback Resort in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains has suspended its bell service, though guests can use bell carts which have been sanitized after every use. Its hotel employees aren't opening car or taxi doors upon arrival either.

Stepping into the lobby

Don't be alarmed if you're stopped at the hotel's front door for a wellness screening and temperature check. This is what Camelback is doing. The resort — which is scheduled to reopen on June 11 — is also asking guests to use hand sanitizer, wear a mask and comply with six-foot social distancing policies. Next, you reach for the front door, and — there's no handle? It's been removed to eliminate a major touch point. How about a welcome drink? No dice. Instead, you'll be provided with branded PPE (personal protective equipment) upon arrival. Inside the lobby, you will likely find your favorite hotel looks different. Aesthetics are taking a backseat to safety with social distancing signage displayed throughout hotels, hand sanitizing stations placed every 50 to 100 feet and furniture removed to discourage congregating. Floors may be marked to encourage one-way pedestrian flow between entrances and exits.

Checking into your room

To check in, there is a good chance you'll avoid the front desk entirely. Hotels, such as the The Wayfinder Hotel in Newport, Rhode Island, are offering curbside check-in while major hotel chains are transitioning to ""digital keys"" which allow you to check in and out (and pay your bill) via your mobile phone. This eliminates the need for magnetic key cards (which must be sanitized after every use), queuing with other guests and interacting with the front desk staff. Hilton has introduced contactless check-in and check-outs at more than 4,700 hotels around the globe, including its Waldorf Astoria and Conrad Hotels & Resorts. The new technology will require enhanced communication with guests, many of whom are accustomed to heading straight to the front desk, which is exactly what hotels want to avoid.

Front desk staff will still be present — likely standing behind a plexiglass partition — and sporting new accoutrements to their impeccably polished attire: masks and gloves. Chip and pin readers will be used to avoid the need to pass credit cards for payment, an act the AHLA recommends should result in an employee washing their hands ""for at least 20 seconds."" The front desk, even if not used much, will be cleaned at multiple points throughout the day, as will elevator buttons, public bathrooms, vending machines, ATMs, handrails and seating areas.

Walking through the hotel

Staff may no longer escort you to — or show you around — your room, and elevators are being limited to just the people in your party. The latter may not be as hard as it sounds, as more hotels are instituting maximum guest occupancy rates, such as the Relais & Chateaux hotel Eden Roc Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic which will operate at a maximum of 30% capacity, while European luxury hotel brand Rocco Forte Hotels is limiting the number of guests per floor.

On the way to the room, you'll likely pass more cleaning staff than in the past — for good reason. ""Hotels will have more visual cleaning staff and sanitizing stations. Housekeepers will move from behind the scene to front and center in hotels,"" said Tony Kim, assistant professor at Hart School of Hospitality, Sport and Recreation management at James Madison University, noting the mere presence of cleaning staff will make guests feel safer.

Inside your hotel room

Changes to your room may be apparent before you even enter. Hilton is applying a seal on guestroom doors to indicate they haven't been accessed since they were last cleaned. The room itself may look strangely bare. Why? Items that are difficult to disinfect are missing, including decorative pillows, bed scarves, notepads, pamphlets and pens. Minibars — they're gone too, though they may be replaced in another way, such as the pop-up bodegas being installed at the front desk of Kimpton luxury boutique hotels. Other items, such as robes, will be available upon request. On the upside, a welcome drink and cool hand towel may be waiting for you in your room, as Sandals Resorts are doing. Many hotels are giving guests in-room personal safety kits stocked with masks, disinfectant and wipes.

Guests at luxury, all-inclusive AMResorts in the Caribbean and Central and South America will find pillows, blankets and in-room tablets sealed in vacuum packaging. Remington Hotels — a Dallas-based hospitality group that manages select Sheraton, Westin and Marriott hotels among others — is testing Germ Guard, a single-use preventative sleeve that slides over remote control devices. Daily newspaper deliveries are going digital with electronic PressReader access that customers can read on their personal devices. Similarly, face-to-face concierge services are moving to text messaging through software such as Kipsu and Whistle. None of this — not one part — will come easy for hotels. ""Hotels have always focused on personalized service and providing a warm, welcoming environment for its guests,"" said Kate Walsh, the dean of the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University. ""The challenge for hotels will be to convey the essence of hospitality when we socially distance and disconnect guests from the staff.""

Housekeeping matters

Perhaps one of the biggest changes will be to housekeeping services. Room cleanings will be more intense but conducted less often, at least for guests staying multiple nights. Unless specifically requested, most cleanings will be done after guests leave. Some hotels, such as Best Western, are waiting 24 to 72 hours to enter a room after guests have left. Room cleanings are now concentrating on high-touch points, such as door and furniture handles, faucets, light switches, remote controls, thermostats, clocks and hangers. Used towels may be placed outside the door for pickup and replaced with a sealed bag of fresh ones, again found outside the door. Major brands such as Hilton and Marriott are turning to electrostatic sprayers and ultraviolet light technology. Sandals Resorts are sanitizing air ducts upon each departure and steam-cleaning room carpets every week.

The Westin Houston Medical Center was the first hotel to deploy robots to disinfect guest rooms and communal areas. Made by San Antonio-based Xenex Disinfection Services, the germ-zapping robots are designed to kill bacteria, fungi and viruses using UV light. They have been shown to destroy coronavirus, the company says.

Restaurants and room service

Amani Roberts, co-director of Cal State Fullerton's Center for Entertainment and Hospitality Management, believes hotel food and beverage outlets and banquet facilities will be affected more than any other area. ""I personally think buffets will no longer be in existence, which will increase food costs for hotels,"" he said. The AHLA recommends limiting buffets, but if offered, serving them via a masked attendant. Remington Hotels are moving away from buffets to open seating arrangements in outdoor areas. ""Many restaurants in a hotel will either remain closed or limit the capacity. If remaining closed, hotels will offer room delivery service — some via a robot-delivery system — or quick grab-and-go service,"" said Kim. ""If hotels decided to open, they will limit the capacity by removing some tables and chairs and installing partitions for communal tables.""

Hotel restaurants are moving to paper and digital menus, the latter located on walls or via customer's mobile phone, with a renewed reliance on single-use plastic and paper products. Bar stools are being removed to provide space between customers. Payment will happen table-side at sanitized mobile credit card terminals, like that at the InterContinental Los Angeles Downtown. Other hotels are getting creative. Room service menus are being expanded, delivery is moving to ""knock and drop"" at guest doors and ordering is done via customers' mobile phones, such as that offered at over 3,200 Marriott hotels. The Palms Turks & Caicos is introducing family-style in-room dining menus, and the historic Washington School House Hotel in Park City, Utah, has started a new ""Anyplace Dining"" option where guests can eat in quiet parts of the hotel, by the pool and in the private garden.

Communal spaces and entertainment

Many sports and recreational areas are closed or operating at limited capacities with enhanced cleanings. Some hotels are limiting pools to half the normal number of people allowed. ""Similar to guests making a massage appointment, hotels may now require advance-timed reservations for using the tennis court, pool, spa and other amenities,"" said Rob Karp, CEO of luxury travel agency MilesAhead.

That's what Maine's Kennebunkport Resort Collection decided to do when it made the gym accessible by reservation only. It's cleaning the gym before and after each guest and introducing in-room fitness options. Other hotels are allowing guests to use bikes, beach chairs and umbrellas but are cleaning them after every use.

Michigan is the tenth-largest state by population, but it has the third-largest number of deaths resulting from COVID-19. The state’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, enacted some of the country’s most stringent stay-at-home orders, even forbidding landscaping and fishing. Furious, and sometimes armed, protesters in Michigan made national news. Meanwhile, Whitmer’s outspoken criticism of the Trump Administration’s efforts on behalf of the states made her a frequent target of the President. “I didn’t ask to be thrown into the national spotlight,” Whitmer tells Susan B. Glasser. “I’m just trying to do my job, and I’m never going to apologize for that. Because lives are at stake here.” Whitmer’s national visibility has brought forward rumors that she is on the short list for Joe Biden’s Vice-Presidential pick. Whitmer is a sexual-assault survivor, and she explains why she stands by Biden despite an accusation made by his former aide Tara Reade.

Glasser also speaks with David Remnick about the tensions that have emerged between the federal government and the states. Although mostly he has targeted Democratic governors, Trump has also criticized some in his own party.",1
539,539,661,The disappointing truth about antibody testing,"Did you get seriously sick this year? Have you, like many others, been wondering if it was COVID-19? “I get emails every day,” says George Rutherford, a University of California San Francisco epidemiologist. They say things like, “I think I might have had it. I really want to know,” he says.

Maybe you’ve been tempted by the wave of antibody tests that recently hit the market — but don’t think that just because you can buy a test, it will be accurate.

There are lots of tests available, but it’s not entirely clear which ones are best. Tests can go wrong in several places: by choosing the wrong proteins to look for, by using the wrong chemicals in the test itself, or by making the test badly. For instance, the UK paid $20 million for antibody tests that didn’t work.

“It’s kind of like the wild West.”

The US Food and Drug Administration allowed test makers to market their antibody tests, even if they hadn’t undergone review by the agency. The Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) has raised concerns about this: “We now have at least 90 tests on the market, and we don’t know about the accuracy of the results,” Kelly Wroblewski, APHL’s director of infectious disease programs, told USA Today.

“It’s kind of like the wild West,” says Janko Nikolich-Zugich, the head of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Tucson’s department of immunobiology. One of the reasons the University of Arizona wound up making its own antibody test was because it wasn’t clear how reliable other ones might be, he says.

“It’s very attractive to think about, ‘I’m going to go to a drive-through and get a finger prick and I’ll get an answer,’” says Patricia Slev, the section chief for immunology at ARUP Laboratories, a national reference lab. But most of these rapid tests don’t have independent validation that the test works the way the manufacturer says. Consumers who want to make sure they’re getting good antibody tests should look for ones that have outside testing to confirm the test is accurate.

That relaxed policy has since been revised. On May 4th, the FDA said that if test makers didn’t submit data showing their accuracy within 10 days, the agency would yank the tests from the market. “We unfortunately see unscrupulous actors marketing fraudulent test kits and using the pandemic as an opportunity to take advantage of Americans’ anxiety,” the FDA statement read.

“If your kit has 14 percent false positive, it’s useless.”

Several labs, including Slev’s ARUP, are now doing independent validation of antibody tests. Already, there are some early results: a manuscript that hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed or published from a group of scientists led by the University of California San Francisco and the University of California, Berkeley. Only three of the 14 tests the group evaluated were reliable. Four of the tests had false positive rates that ranged from 11 to 16 percent. “Those numbers are just unacceptable,” Scott Hensley, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told The New York Times. “If your kit has 14 percent false positive, it’s useless.”

“I am waiting for the ultimate good test,” says Robert Gallo, the co-founder and director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University School of Medicine and the co-founder of the Global Virus Network. Gallo helped develop the antibody test for HIV.

And if you’ve been pinning your hopes for getting back to normal on antibody testing that would “certify” people as safe to work or travel if they’ve already been sick, I have bad news: The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against “immunity passports.” Even if the tests were 100 percent accurate, we still don’t know whether antibodies to the new coronavirus will protect people from being reinfected. If they do confer protection, we don’t know whether it’s full or partial or how long it’ll last. Even skipping the process questions — What authority would issue these, and to whom? — this seems like a bad idea.

Chile is preparing to put out “release certificates” for people who’ve recovered from COVID-19, despite the WHO’s warning. Other countries, such as the UK, have also expressed an interest — as has Los Angeles’ mayor.

Some experts have expressed concerns that people will rush to get “immunity passports” without understanding the limitations of antibody testing. “What I worry about is that employers will misuse this,” Rutherford says. It may be true that accurate antibody testing could let us know who’s protected from COVID-19, but that hasn’t been proven yet, Rutherford says.

To understand why these tests may not be the solution everyone’s hoping for, I spoke to some experts about how antibodies work, why false positives are important, and what real uses for antibody testing might be.

What is an antibody test?

An antibody test is a way of seeing if a person’s immune system has responded to something. In the case of COVID-19, it’s a way of seeing who’s had the new coronavirus, which is different from the tests used to diagnose the illness. Though antibody tests can be used to diagnose diseases, in the case of COVID-19, they’re not very helpful for diagnoses. That’s because people don’t make antibodies to fight off the virus until at least a week — or even two weeks — after showing symptoms. Tests used for diagnosis look for virus fragments and can spot infections much earlier.

How do antibodies work?

Antibodies are part of how your body responds to threats: viruses, bacteria, and other things the body decides are harmful. Imagine someone coughs on you and infects you with the new coronavirus. The virus can’t reproduce on its own, so it invades your cells to make copies of itself. Eventually, your immune system cottons on. Here’s what happens:

⤷ Some specialized immune cells shred the virus and present its fragments to a kind of white blood cell called a B cell.

⤷ When the fragments hit the B cell, it clones itself and transforms into an antibody factory.

⤷ The antibodies the B cell creates are then released into the bloodstream.

⤷ The antibodies vary in quality: some may glom on to the virus and inactivate it.

⤷ Some may stick to the virus and signal other immune cells to come kill the virus.

⤷ Some will do nothing. And sometimes, antibodies can make things worse. How effective antibodies are will vary by person and disease.

In HIV, for instance, antibodies are just a marker of infection. Because the virus attacks the immune system, the antibodies don’t do a great job of fighting off the virus, says Rutherford. The majority of antibodies for most illnesses are neither good nor bad for you, says Gallo. They’re just a marker that you’ve been exposed to an illness. “A good majority of them are irrelevant for protection of you, and irrelevant for how the disease is progressing,” Gallo says.

It’s also possible that they can inactivate the virus — for instance, by gumming up the spike the virus uses to insert itself into your cells; these antibodies are called “neutralizing antibodies” and are the most important kind for protection. They “are what you need for vaccines to work,” says Rutherford. If we do produce neutralizing antibodies when we’re infected by the new coronavirus, it might be possible to pick one that works really well and make a version in labs that can be used to treat the illness.

It’s possible to test for neutralizing antibodies, but it’s expensive and difficult to do at a mass scale. “It’s a very labor-intensive laboratory thing,” Rutherford says. The commercially available tests don’t do this. Most of them just give people a “yes” or “no” on whether the antibodies exist.

Unfortunately, it’s not yet clear what antibodies do in COVID-19

Neutralizing antibodies aren’t the only way antibodies might help us, Gallo says. Some antibodies serve as signal flares by grabbing on to a different part of the virus and alerting the immune system’s killer cells. But in some cases, such as dengue, antibodies can actually make a later infection worse.

Unfortunately, it’s not yet clear what antibodies do in COVID-19. For instance, the prevalence of antibodies doesn’t mean that the amount of virus in a person’s system declines, according to a study of German patients. And the less virus in your body, the better.

If I have antibodies to the new coronavirus, does that mean I won’t get sick again?

We don’t know. The virus is too new. The question of reinfection is “an unknown,” according to Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s emergencies programs.

Some Chinese, South Korean, and Japanese patients who left the hospital after testing negative for the virus were later readmitted and tested positive for the virus again. We don’t yet know why, but other coronaviruses usually can’t reinfect people for months or even years. It’s possible that this is the result of false negatives on their tests. It’s also possible that people continue to excrete viral fragments that show up in testing after the disease has passed. Rectal swabs and stool culture remain positive for about a month, “and that has nothing to do with transmission,” Rutherford says. “It’s just pieces of digested virus.”

An early draft of an article supports the idea that these patients weren’t reinfected. Chinese scientists infected two rhesus monkeys with COVID-19, then let them recover. Thirty days later, the scientists tried to infect the monkeys again. The monkeys didn’t get sick a second time. This article hasn’t been finalized, though; it’s been posted to let other scientists critique it. The final version may change.

There are some encouraging signs that antibodies may confer protection. One is serum therapy where parts of the blood that include antibodies are spun out from survivors of COVID-19 infections and given to people who are sick. In a study of 10 patients, being given survivors’ serum “significantly improved” those patients’ symptoms. That study is too small to be definitive, but it does suggest that larger trials of serum therapy might be a good idea.

Does it matter how many antibodies you have?

Again, we don’t know. It’s still too early to know what might serve as signposts for protection. It’s also too early to know what level of antibodies might signal a person who’s recovered from COVID-19 would be a good serum donor.

The total amount of antibodies to COVID-19 in patients’ blood varies widely, according to an early report from Fudan University in Shanghai. (The paper was also put online for the research community to comment on and is not yet finalized.) Younger patients had fewer antibodies, and in 10 young patients who’d tested positive for the virus and then recovered, researchers didn’t detect any neutralizing antibodies at all. About a third of patients showed low levels of antibodies. It’s possible that’s because other parts of the immune system attacked and defeated the coronavirus — but antibodies and the cells that produce them are the keys to remaining protected. The low levels of antibodies here also may make it difficult to interpret population-level data; if someone was infected but didn’t produce antibodies, will we get an accurate count of cases?

In other coronaviruses — the ones that cause the common cold — the way people form antibodies seems to vary by age: people over the age of 60 are better at forming antibodies that neutralize the virus as well as ones that signal to the immune system’s killer cells.

There’s another way antibody testing might be useful, but it’s pretty far off. We know most vaccines work by generating an antibody response, says Nikolich-Zugich. Antibody testing might help drugmakers figure out whether their vaccines against COVID-19 work. In fact, we already do this with the flu vaccine. We know that a certain level of antibodies means a flu shot is effective. For this to be useful in coronavirus, though, we’d have to have a reliable test that indicates a protective immune response and some sense of what that looks like. Learning those things will take time, and we don’t know in advance how long it will be.

How long does protection by antibodies last?

As a reminder: we don’t know yet whether COVID-19 antibodies confer protection. If protection exists, we also don’t know how long it might last. The virus is too new for us to have long-term data. We know, in some diseases — such as HIV — the most-protective antibodies are also the ones that disappear the quickest, says Gallo.

Sometimes, the body forms antibodies to a disease that last a lifetime, like it does with measles. But other times, the immune system seems to “forget” diseases. Take SARS, another coronavirus disease: three years after infection, about a quarter of people didn’t have any detectable antibodies in their blood. Six years after infection, most people didn’t have any. In a small study of patients who’d recovered from MERS — also caused by a coronavirus — people who got very sick had detectable antibodies to the disease two years later, but people with milder illnesses didn’t.

“It’s a slightly different kettle of fish.”

The limited antibody response may be because coronaviruses aren’t in the bloodstream, Rutherford says. “They’re not really exposed to the full force of the immune system. It’s a slightly different kettle of fish.” Instead, the virus attacks the lungs, liver, kidneys, and some other organs.

The coronaviruses we know best — the ones that cause the common cold — can reinfect people after a certain period of time. A study from the 1970s showed that six people who’d had colds after being exposed to one strain of coronavirus were immune when they were reexposed a year later. But another 12 people in the same study who were exposed to a slightly different strain were only partially protected. A tiny study from the 1990s suggests that coronavirus reinfections are milder than the original infection. The coronaviruses that are closest to the one that causes COVID-19 only create immune protection for about a year, according to a modeling study. That may be a clue to how the new coronavirus behaves.

But Slev cautioned against assuming too much about this coronavirus based on other coronaviruses. “There are assumptions [you can make] by looking at other coronaviruses, but really, you want to know the answer for this specific one,” she says. “So really, it’s important to wait to know what the answer is for this virus and we hope to have that answer soon. But right now, we do not have that particular answer for COVID-19.”

Why are antibody tests useful?

The first known death from COVID-19 in the US was on February 6th, in Santa Clara County, California, but the connection to the virus wasn’t made until April. Overall deaths were up 20 percent in March in Santa Clara County from the previous year. California coroners are now examining deaths from as early as December to see if there were more missed cases.

The evidence from California suggests COVID-19 was circulating in the US well before we realized it — and that some number of people may have been sick with the disease without knowing it. We don’t know how widely it was spreading or for how long because we didn’t start testing for the virus early enough. Testing people to see if they have antibodies to the virus may give health officials a better picture of how far the pandemic spread.

Right now, most people who receive diagnostic testing are allowed to because they feel sick. But we know some infections from the novel coronavirus don’t come with symptoms — and those people are being missed by most of our testing efforts. “Nobody knows what the rate of infection is,” Slev says. “An immunologic study could give us an idea on the true rates of infection in the community.”

Even after the testing criteria changed, though, there still weren’t enough tests available. Widespread testing of the population for the virus hasn’t occurred. Tests have been reserved, instead, for some of the sickest patients. We also know some infections by the new coronavirus are asymptomatic. All that means our confirmed case counts are low, but we don’t know exactly how low. Reliable antibody testing might give us a better picture of how much of the population has already been infected, which might give us a better sense of how quickly the virus spreads.

This kind of work can help epidemiologists figure out how much of the population remains vulnerable to COVID-19, how often asymptomatic cases occur, and exactly how deadly the disease is. “We have suspected that the number of undocumented cases is much, much higher than what has been documented by testing for the virus itself,” says Nikolich-Zugich. Antibodies to the virus don’t fade as quickly as the virus does in the body, and they might give us more accurate information on how widely the disease has spread.

Has this kind of antibody testing been done already?

Yes, in a few locations — though doctors have reservations about how accurate the tests are. In a Boston suburb, a sample of people tested on the street showed that about a third of the 64 people who were tested had been exposed to the virus. In a hard-hit German town, about 15 percent of the 200 people tested had antibodies. Those findings are unusual, though; most tests show that less than 5 percent of the population has antibodies.

For instance, early estimates from Santa Clara County, California, suggest that about 1.5 percent of the population had antibodies. If that’s right, the infection rate is 50 to 85 times higher than the official count for coronavirus cases. In Los Angeles County, there might be 28 to 55 times more people infected if those antibody tests are right. In New York, the antibody testing suggests 10 times more people were infected than the testing numbers reflect. These attempts to figure out how many people were sick used different methods and different tests.

“Literally every single one could be a false positive.”

Both the California studies relied on tests from Premier Biotech, which may have a false positive rate as high as 1.7 percent. That’s a problem since Santa Clara’s study found antibodies in 1.5 percent of the people they surveyed. “Literally every single one could be a false positive,” Marm Kilpatrick, an infectious disease expert at the University of California at Santa Cruz, told BuzzFeed News. “No one thinks all of them were, but the problem is we can’t actually exclude the possibility.”

Experts have fewer reservations about the New York testing numbers, which also showed that about 20 percent of New York City’s residents had been exposed to COVID-19. Several experts had suggested that the confirmed case numbers were 2 to 20 times too low; these results seem to confirm that. The New York tests also used a different antibody test. And while this test will also produce errors, it’s been done in a place with a much higher rate of infections, making the results less likely to be skewed by false positives. There is a sampling problem here, though: since people were tested in grocery store parking lots, any parts of the population that don’t go out — for instance, because they are unusually vulnerable to serious illness from COVID-19 — have been missed.

It’s still too early to tell how many people had COVID-19 and didn’t get counted in the official numbers. You should expect to see a bunch more fights between scientists about which studies have good methodology and which ones don’t. (There is a lot of arguing in science, actually.) More reliable data will take time and will come from areas that have been hit harder by the disease.

There have been around 30 attempts at seeing how widespread the virus is, but despite the variations in methodology and fights about accuracy, they broadly show the same thing: most of the population is still vulnerable to COVID-19.

What is a false positive, and why does it matter?

A false positive is what it sounds like: a person who didn’t have a COVID-19 infection but whose test results said they did. In order to determine how likely a test is to produce a false positive, most laboratories use specimens collected from people who have a lot of virus, and people they know haven’t been exposed (for instance, because the sample was taken before December 2019). Test manufacturers often report their “analytic” sensitivity from these samples, which may be more clear-cut than testing in the wild. Independent third-party testing usually leads to a more reliable sense of error rates.

The tests also need to accurately distinguish between people who had the virus that causes COVID-19 and people who’ve had other kinds of coronaviruses. It’s possible that people who’ve recently had one of the four viruses that cause the common cold might test positive for COVID-19 when they’re actually negative, the WHO warns. It’s also possible that people who had SARS or MERS will trigger a positive result.

In the case of antibody testing, false positives matter partly because they’ll give us a wrong picture of how many people have been sick — which could make for bad public health policy. But they especially matter if a person who’s gotten a false positive believes they’re immune and chooses to disregard social distancing. That person is still at risk of getting sick, even if they don’t know it.

“Bad, dangerous information”

Imagine if we were using these tests to put people in groups based on their antibody status, says Rutherford. For simplicity’s sake, imagine a test where 4 percent of results are false positives, and a workforce of 100 people is in a hospital. “You have four people waltzing around saying, ‘Oh, I’m positive, I can’t get it, I don’t need to wear a mask in the ICU,’” Rutherford says. “Au contraire. That’s bad, dangerous information.”

“We can’t accept an extreme number of false positives,” Gallo says. He thinks a 5 percent false positive rate is “on the high side.” “Something is better than nothing right now, yes, but you can get misleading results.”

It’s also possible to get a false negative result, which suggests that you haven’t had COVID-19 even though you were infected. While this also might lead to bad public health decisions, it’s less likely to put a person at risk.

Is it possible to create an antibody test that looks for the right coronavirus?

There are some strategies to make sure that the antibody tests look for the right coronavirus, says Nikolich-Zugich. For instance, the spike protein that the new coronavirus uses to get into human cells “is quite unique in this particular coronavirus relative to the others,” he says. Looking for antibodies to that protein could help discriminate between coronaviruses. (But if other coronaviruses do trip up testing, that might not be a bad thing clinically, says Nikolich-Zugich. It might mean that having a cold recently could protect you from COVID-19; after all, people who are vaccinated against smallpox are also protected against monkey pox, which is caused by a similar virus. In that sense, cross-reactivity would be “a welcome occurrence.”)

If there are all of these uncertainties around coronavirus and antibody testing, what is it good for?

Well, the uncertainties aren’t permanent! Again, we’re just starting to know this virus. Several months from now, we’ll have more information, and years from now, even more.

This is also true of antibody tests, antibodies to coronavirus, and immunity. If we are willing to tolerate this period of uncertainty, we’ll give scientists time to do their jobs. That may mean telling us which tests are useful and which ones aren’t. It might also mean that we keep track of how many people test positive for coronavirus antibodies at a mass scale, rather than as individuals.

The thing people are hoping for is called “herd immunity.” That means that enough people have formed an immune response that the virus doesn’t move through the population like a hot knife through butter. There have been various estimates about how much of the population that would be — some as low as 60 percent and some as high as 90 percent — but no one’s really sure yet because we don’t know how long people remain protected after an infection or even if they are protected at all.

At this point, even our contested antibody testing shows the same thing: we’re not close to herd immunity — not by a long shot. So that’s one immediate use.",1
197,197,267,Three astronauts are launching to space Thursday after lengthy quarantine,"In the wee hours of the morning on April 9th, three astronauts are set to launch on a Russian Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan and journey to the International Space Station, where they’ll join three crew members already living and working in orbit. Because this flight is launching during a pandemic, tighter restrictions and protocols are in place to prevent the novel coronavirus from making its way to space.

The three people headed to orbit Thursday include NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner. Ivanishin and Vagner are last-minute replacements to the flight after one of the original cosmonauts assigned to the mission suffered an eye injury. For Cassidy and Ivanishin, this will be their third trip to orbit, while it will be the first for Vagner. The crew will stay on the ISS for a total of six months.

Final preparations for a trip to the space station from Russia usually begin in Star City — a small town just outside of Moscow. After a brief stay, the crew then heads to Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, where their rocket launches, and enters a two-week quarantine period. Even before the pandemic, NASA and Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, required crews to enter a two-week quarantine ahead of their launch date, to ensure the travelers don’t inadvertently carry a nasty bug to space.

“We’ve been sort of isolated to our cottages and just the essential place to go to get food.”

However, quarantine procedures accelerated slightly while the crews were still in Star City. Around the time of Cassidy’s arrival at the beginning of March, stricter travel restrictions and social distancing measures were enacted all over the world to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“Had I been in normal quarantine, I probably could have gone out to some restaurants and left the immediate parameters of the Star City area and just been smart about where we went,” Cassidy said during a round of press interviews on March 19th. “But not this time. We’ve been sort of isolated to our cottages and just the essential place to go to get food.”

Pavel Vlasov, head of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) in Star City, confirmed that the crews started quarantining earlier than usual. “They do not go on any trips even the traditional like visiting the Kremlin wall and [Sergei] Korolev’s house before setting off to Baikonur,” Vlasov said in a statement on the Roscosmos website.

Cassidy has since traveled to Baikonur Cosmodrome and gone through the regular quarantine procedures. NASA maintains that its employees have been following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for controlling infections ahead of quarantine, “such as cleaning of surfaces, social distancing, emphasizing hand hygiene, encouraging NASA team members who are sick to stay home and limiting contact with crew members,” according to a NASA spokesperson. Meanwhile, Cassidy and his crewmates have stayed relatively isolated in their hotel, prepping for the mission, exercising, and even playing ping-pong. “Ironically, the timing of our entering the strict quarantine protocol somewhat magically lined up with the world caving in, in terms of quarantine protocol,” Cassidy said.

But come launch day, the sights and sounds leading up to the mission will be much quieter than usual. Roscosmos has banned all media from covering the launch in person, and there will be fewer people on site to cheer the astronauts as they head to the rocket. “Normally as you come walking out of the hotel... there’s music playing and there’s crowds of people lining the walkway as we proceed from the hotel to the buses, and it’s very, very motivating. It’s super exciting,” Cassidy said. But those celebrations will be absent this time around. “It’ll be completely quiet. There won’t be anybody there. We’ll just kind of walk out. Maybe we’ll still play the music and fire the three of us up ourselves. But who knows?”

“I certainly am not going to be disengaged from it thinking it’s not my problem.”

None of Cassidy’s family or friends can be at the launch due to travel restrictions. His wife was able to be with him while in Star City, and she had planned to attend the launch. But after Russia restricted foreign travel on March 16th, her itinerary changed. Ultimately, she went home when he headed to Baikonur Cosmodrome. “We thought we would say goodbye on launch day,” Cassidy said.

Despite everything, Cassidy is feeling good ahead of launch. He even shared a rap his friend made on Instagram about how to stay at home to fight COVID-19. He hopes that all of the extra precautions were enough to prevent COVID-19’s spread to space. “I really haven’t been around anybody else, so it’d be really, really strange if I did contract something,” Cassidy said on March 19th. “Anything can happen between now and April 9th, but we’re being really super vigilant so that I can remain healthy to get to the station.”

While on board the ISS, the crew will conduct science experiments and maybe even go on some spacewalks down the line. If all goes according to plan, this crew will likely be an audience to this summer’s most anticipated spaceflight event: the arrival of the first crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon. The vehicle, developed as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, is slated to take off this May, carrying NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the space station. But while there’s plenty to look forward to in space, Cassidy said his mind won’t stray far from what’s happening on the Earth below.

“I’ll have a full plate and my mind will be engaged, but I’m still going to be talking, communicating, emailing with my family and loved ones and friends,” Cassidy said. “I certainly am not going to be disengaged from it thinking it’s not my problem. It’s certainly my problem, because my family is living it and my friends and my co-workers are living it in real time.”

Takeoff for the mission is slated for 4:05AM ET on April 9th. After launch, the crew will make four orbits around Earth and arrive at the International Space Station six hours later. NASA’s coverage of the launch will begin at 3AM ET, and coverage of docking will begin at 9:30AM ET.",1
1025,1025,1221,Know the risks: Where you are most likely to get coronavirus,"Know the risks: Where you are most likely to get coronavirus The data suggests that most people will get infected in their home.

Recommendations on how to protect ourselves from contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 are everywhere, like washing your hands, wearing a mask, and staying at least 6 feet away from people outside your home. But not all risks are created equal; home, public transportation and the grocery store all have different challenges.

A blog post by University of Massachusetts Dartmouth professor, Dr. Erin Bromage, who studies immunity of infectious diseases in animals, titled ""The Risks - Know Them - Avoid Them"" garnered major attention for showing that some of the highest risk areas may not be what you'd expect.

A lot of attention is being spent on opening up the economy, but it seems like the highest risk is more likely your own living room.

The data suggests that most people will get infected in their home, according to Bromage.

Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.

So where are the highest risk areas in the community for getting infected?

""The general theme of what I can see is, lots of people together in an enclosed environment with poor airflow and usually some sort of talking or singing involved leads to lots of people in that environment getting infected,"" said Bromage, in an interview with ABC News.

Case studies that traced back COVID-19 outbreaks at the beginning of the pandemic, have found that the main sources of infections in the community lead back to the workplace, public transportation, social gatherings, and restaurants — indoor environments, with limited air circulation, and many people spending a prolonged period of time in the same place.

Some of the biggest outbreaks, excluding nursing homes, in fact, that have been reported and traced occurred in prisons, religious ceremonies, choir practices, indoor sporting events, and even birthday parties.

""You've got a lot of people in an enclosed space with lots of huffing, puffing, or yelling, which just led to large outbreak events,"" Bromage said.

Being exposed to the virus does not automatically mean you will be infected. A successful infection is dependent on the time exposed to the virus and the amount of viral particles you are exposed to. For example, ""While joggers may be releasing more virus due to deep breathing, remember the exposure time is also less due to their speed,"" Bromage writes.

Scientists call the amount of exposure to the virus that leads to infection the ""infectious dose."" Although scientists are still learning more about how many viral particles lead to infection, they do know that sneezing and coughing release the highest amount of viral material into the air, and you're more likely to become infected if you're in a confined space.

A single sneeze, according to Bromage, has been estimated to release about 30,000 droplets that can travel up to 200 miles per hour, which means it could easily cross a room. A cough releases round 3,000 droplets that can travel around 50 miles per hour. These particles may drop to the ground or could hang around in the air for a short period of time.

In fact, a recently published study showed that speaking loudly in an enclosed space creates ""substantial"" risk of transmitting the virus to others. Prolonged contact and lots of direct talking, breathing, and yelling between individuals increases the direct exposure to viral particles, which increases the likelihood for infection.

The amount of virus a person release changes over the course of the infection and varies by person. This is dependent on the infected persons' viral load, which is the amount of the virus detected in a test sample from a patient and reflects how well the virus is replicating.

Many people are asymptomatic and may easily spread the virus, unknowingly, by directly talking, singing, yelling, or even breathing around other people in close contact. This is why the CDC advises that everyone wear face coverings in public.

Bromage underscores that the exact number of people infected by respiratory droplets versus transmission through touching contaminated objects like door handles and elevator buttons is unknown, which is why it's also important to wash your hands often and avoid touching your face. But the compilation of studies he wrote, ""serves to highlight that being in an enclosed space, sharing the same air for a prolonged period increases your chances of exposure and infection.""

In very high-risk situations, social distancing guidelines are not as effective because even if you are far away from an infected individual in a small, poorly ventilated enclosed space for a long period of time, a low dose of the virus in the air can reach you and over a sustained period of time may be enough to cause infection.

Bromage said that the activities many typically view as highest risk for infection like grocery shopping might not be as risky if you're spending a brief amount of time at the store, you're avoiding other shoppers, not speaking directly with people, and the store restricts the number of people that can enter at a given time.

Public bathrooms may also pose a risk, but for slightly different reasons, said Bromage. Bathrooms have a lot of high touch surfaces like door handles, faucets, and countertops.

So far, the science seems to suggest that outdoor areas and large ventilated spaces are the lowest risk areas for infection. Outdoor areas are generally safer because wind and infinite air space could dilute the viral particles circulating. If you are actively moving outside that also reduces the exposure time to any viral particles hanging around.

With restrictions lifted in some states, many Americans will face a new challenge: ""Just because something is open doesn't mean it is an instruction to go,"" said Dr. Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health at UC Irvine.

Before you put yourself in a high-risk situation, Bromage suggests asking yourself, ""Are there too many people here and how much time have they spent here? Are there loud talkers? Singing or yelling? What's the amount of people in my area that actually are infected?"" If you are in an environment with a lot of people, you should also assess what changes the business owner put in place to lower the risk of virus spreading.

If you choose to meet other people, you should also consider their level of exposure and health status. Ask your friends or family where they have been, how often they go to the store and whether they have been staying home, suggests Dr. Henry Raymond, epidemiologist and associate professor at Rutgers University.

""It's not just about your health but about the health of those people around you,"" Raymond said.

If you know your friend or relative has underlying health conditions or is at an increased risk of developing severe symptoms due to a weaker immune system you should take extra precautions to avoid exposing them to the virus. If your state permits social gatherings and you decide to meet up, keep it to a small group and make it safe as possible by staying outside, Raymond said. Agree on some ground rules, such as: ""We don't shake hands, we bring our own food, we space the chair out at least 6 feet away.""

""The best course of action is to be personally cautious and personally responsible. We don't have a vaccine. But we do have social distancing and masks,"" said Raymond.

The Swedish furniture giant announced today that it would open 19 of its stores across the UK on June 1st.

However, families hoping to make a day of visiting the store can forget about it – only one adult and one child per household is allowed.

“Other measures to ensure safer trading during the coronavirus outbreak include “social distance wardens” to help shoppers navigate a new one-way system,” reports the Guardian.

Get ready; Our whole society is about to be patrolled by a new breed of busy-bodies telling you how to behave, where to stand, where to sit, where you can walk.

Karens all over the world are rejoicing at the prospect of getting paid for what they love the most – interfering in other people’s business.

All this in response to a virus which, according to the CDC, has a fatality rate of 0.26%, making it no more deadly than a bad bout of seasonal flu.

We’re pedantically re-arranging our entire society around social distancing cringe and empowering an army of new enforcers to make our lives miserable.

All in the name of transitioning out of a lockdown which, according to innumerable experts, will be responsible for more deaths than coronavirus itself.

687,687,832,We hear the cry in nursing homes — ‘Help me!’ — yet we turn away,"As a young man, I stumbled out of an elevator onto the “Help me!” floor.

An ancient woman, whose pleadings will haunt me to my death, sat in a hallway in a wheelchair endlessly shouting, “Help me! Help me!” with her arms outstretched.

I ran to the nursing station nearby, where many people were busily working but ignoring the patient in need. “That woman needs help,” I barked.

A nurse, nurse’s assistant, attendant or someone in a uniform whose rank I could not identify slowly turned their head toward me from the paperwork they were working on at the time.

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

“She does not need help,” this person said very firmly. “That is just what she does.”

I was convinced that this nursing home employee was a wretched person, as were they all. No feeling individual could turn a deaf ear to such cries of anguish. I walked over to the woman myself and said, “Can I help you?”

“Help me,” the tiny woman cried. “Help me!” There was no further explanation.

Years passed. I grew older. Visited many nursing homes. And eventually placed my father in one.

And one day, that tough old man, that World War II veteran, that survivor of the Great Depression, who as far as I know never asked anything from anyone, was sitting in his wheelchair in a hallway shouting, “Help me!”

“What, Dad?” I asked. “What do you need?”

He looked at me with searching eyes and said, “I don’t know.”

I came to the conclusion that he wanted out. Out of his predicament. Not just out of the nursing home, that wretched place where people wait for the end, but out of his body and out of the muddle that perplexed his mind.

It is a terrible place to be. To live or to work. To even think about.

I suppose that is why so many of us refuse to visit long-term care facilities, even before COVID-19 struck, before there was a quarantine.

I would visit my father every day. But I was usually alone. That didn’t make me better than other people. It did make me a little more mentally unstable during that time, I suspect.

It is said that for most states, a third of COVID-19 deaths are in long-term care facilities. In 14 states, more than half of the virus deaths are in such places.

Political leaders must do something to help our elderly, shriek those with grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts and uncles, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, in such places.

And political leaders themselves shout that something must be done.

Yet, we know what these places are. We always have.

They are underfunded. Inspections are haphazard. They are often money factories. They are far too often warehouses, storage facilities, for those waiting to die.

That is not to say we don’t love the people inside. In fact, often we love them too much to see them waste away. It is terrifying to watch such a thing.

And so we leave underpaid, overworked and too often uncaring people to deal with the dirty work. We don’t want to look.

What happens when we don’t look is the same thing that always happens when people turn away. Abuse. Neglect. Incompetence.

There are sometimes angels at work in these places. I have seen them with my own eyes. They care. They pay a personal price I cannot imagine.

But when I hear howls of righteous indignation on this issue from the public and their representatives, I am reminded of the false outrage that erupts following a mass shooting by people who are mentally ill.

We are all standing on the “Help me!” floor listening to the anguished cries. I sometimes wonder if that’s my own pathetic voice I hear joining the chorus.

695,695,851,US federal agencies warn that Chinese hackers are targeting COVID-19 research on vaccines and treatments,"The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a joint statement Wednesday warning that China-affiliated ""cyber actors and non-traditional collectors"" were targeting COVID-19 research.

""China's efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation's response to COVID-19,"" the two federal agencies said.

China has denied involvement in any cyberattacks on COVID-19 research organizations.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

US federal agencies on Wednesday said Chinese hackers were targeting COVID-19 research operations and attempting to gather information on subjects including vaccines and treatments.

The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday said ""PRC-affiliated cyber actors and non-traditional collectors"" had been observed ""attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research.""

""China's efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation's response to COVID-19,"" the agencies said. ""The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options.""

Wednesday's announcement was issued to raise awareness among healthcare, pharmaceutical, and research operations that might be targeted. The FBI and the CISA suggested that at-risk organizations ""maintain dedicated cybersecurity and insider threat practices,"" such as patching critical vulnerabilities, actively scanning for unauthorized access, and strengthening authentication processes.

Last week, US and UK security agencies issued a joint statement warning of cybersecurity threats to the operations of organizations involved in responding to the coronavirus, saying that unnamed actors were targeting ""national and international healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and local government with the likely aim of gathering information related to the coronavirus outbreak.""

The warning issued Wednesday was more specific, calling attention to suspected Chinese activity in the networks of related organizations.

The Chinese government has denied involvement in such cyberattacks on US organizations.

""China is a staunch upholder of cybersecurity and a victim to cyberattacks,"" a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said this week. ""We firmly oppose and fight all kinds of cyberattacks conducted by hackers.""

""We are leading the world in COVID-19 treatment and vaccine research,"" he added. ""It is immoral to target China with rumors and slanders in the absence of any evidence.""

The FBI and CISA said additional details on the threat posed by cybercriminals would be released in the coming days.

The warning from these two US federal agencies comes at a time of heightened tension between Washington and Beijing, with each side criticizing the other for failures in responding appropriately to the coronavirus.

""What else is new with China? I'm not happy with China, could have stopped it at the source, should have,"" President Donald Trump said Monday when asked about reports that Chinese hackers were targeting COVID-19 research. ""Now you're telling me they're hacking. What else is new? We're watching very closely.""",1

A musician leaned out of his car and played the official U.S. Army theme on his trumpet. Sachs, a veteran of World War II who participated in the Normandy invasion on D-Day June 6, 1944, responded with a salute.

A Los Angeles County Sheriff’s helicopter hovered overhead and police and fire sirens erupted in a crazy kind of unison.

Kate Smith’s rendition of “God Bless America,” blared over loudspeakers.

More than 200 flags were placed in the ground in the front yard.

The voice of Frank Sinatra crooned “Young at Heart.” After all, Sam said the lyric “…and if you should survive to 105, think of all you’ll derive out of being alive” inspired him to stay put on the planet for as long as he has.

More than 150 neighbors and well-wishers, most wearing masks because of the coronavirus crisis and striving to keep their distance, applauded and shouted out as cars passed by.

Sachs, who stood for 90 minutes while leaning on a railing, was clearly moved by the demonstration of love.

“Today has just been overwhelming,” he said. “This is the best birthday party I have ever had. How many times can I say thank you to all of you?”

Every variety of birthday card — more than 6,000 of them — were displayed on tables in the driveway. And that’s sort of where this ultimate birthday party was born.

Ivonne Meader, owner and administrator of the Mom and Dad’s House facility where Sam lives, realized that “Safer At Home” measures were sure to prevent a traditional gathering for his birthday.

Meader posted a video of Sachs telling his story on YouTube, and urging folks to send birthday cards. Surely a few dozen would arrive. The video went viral, was reported upon by every media outlet imaginable and even wooed local government to get involved, with Lakewood Mayor Todd Rogers and the City Council taking up the crusade.

The cards poured in from every state in the nation, we well as from England, Canada and South Korea.

One of the cards: A hand-signed note from President Donald Trump, who thanked Sachs for service to his country.

Michael R. Brown, the mayor of Grand Forks, North Dakota, where Sachs was born and raised, sent word that Sachs’s birthday was declared “Sam Sachs Day” in the city.

“Unbelievable,” Sachs kept saying from his porch as the parade — ranging from classic cars of the Sultans Car Club to hot rods to soccer-mom minivans, pickup trucks and first responder vehicles — rolled on for more than an hour.

Some observers opined that the parade must have been one of the longest, if not the longest, drive-by celebration, suddenly a Southern California tradition amid the pandemic.

Rick Smith, president of the Sultans — who was driving a white 1955 Chevrolet — said the club felt honored to celebrate Sachs’s life.

Doug Vaughn, an original member of the Sultans — driving a 1952 purple deluxe Chevrolet coupe — said he and many of the Sultans were veterans who were grateful for his service.

On June 6, 1944, Sachs was the lead officer in a glider with the grim nickname of “Flying Coffin” because it had no weapons to protect itself from enemy fire during the mammoth, historic D-Day invasion of Normandy. His glider was filled with machine guns, ammunition and eight soldiers whose job was to land behind enemy lines and destroy German defenses. He survived the bloody assault, which cost thousands of lives on both sides, but was pivotal in securing World War II victory for the Allies.

“We love you, Sam!” said one handmade sign held by a young boy who leaned out oft the window of an SUV.

A pickup truck went by painted entirely in the colors of the Los Angeles Rams football team and bearing the team logo.

Steve Leff, a retired Anaheim police officer now living in Riverside, gave Sachs a wooden plaque recognizing his time with the 82nd Airborne Division.

“This day has brought tears to my eyes,” said Sharon Strong, a next-door neighbor of Sachs.

“He is such a great person,” said another neighbor, Nancy Tran. “He is so sweet and walks by our house every day for exercise. He always says hello.”

Samuella McMahon, another neighbor, was there with her children, Aiden, 11, Saoirse, 10, and Caoimhe, 5, who had made signs wishing Sachs a happy birthday.

Later in the afternoon, the city of Lakewood had a more formal program.

Mayor Rogers called Sachs “a true American hero.”

Rogers read aloud that proclamation from his counterpart in Grand Forks, where Sachs was born on April 26,1915.

Naresh Solanki, mayor of Cerritos, where Sachs lived for more than 50 years before moving into the assisted care home operated by Mom & Dad’s House in Lakewood, congratulated Sachs.

Specialist Raivyn Hearne from the 40th Infantry Division Band of the California Army National Guard belted out the National Anthem.

And then Hearne led the throng in one of the most anticipated, and most heartfelt, renditions of “Happy Birthday to You” ever sung.

Sachs ended the celebration by observing how the coronavirus crisis had brought “another level of reality to the world” but also “produced an unimaginable level of kindness to me and others.”

Did the day measure up? Sachs called it “the most magical time in my life.”

And he’ll be back for his 106th, he vowed.

“I hope I see all of you here again next year,” Sachs said with a smile. “I’m going to work on it.”",1
1046,1046,1242,Voter suppression and the impact of COVID-19 on people of color,"Rev. William Barber:

Well, first of all, we're not getting all the statistics. I mean, we get like in Mississippi, 80 percent of the people in one area that died from COVID-19. It might be we're not as shocked because we weren't dealing with it before. And we weren't shocked when a quarter million people were dying from poverty and no income.

You know, we weren't shocked enough when the Supreme Court rolled back the Voting Rights Act and it's 2013. We've had less voting rights than we've had since 1965. And McConnell, for instance, has blocked fixing the Voting Rights Act for over two thousand days.

We weren't really shocked as a nation when we knew before COVID, sixty two million people got up and will work every day without a living wage. Four million people could get up every morning and buy unleaded gas and not buy unleaded water. We were spending 53 cents of every discretionary dollar on the military and less than fifteen cents of every discretion dollar on education, infrastructure and health care.

Our consciousness has and moral consciousness has been so dulled right and we've been locked in this Reaganism, locked in this trickle down, locked in this neo-liberalism. And this and we've been locked in this left right debate. This what the reality of poverty and low income is not about left and right. It's about the very soul at the heart of this of this nation and that we are not upholding even our constitutional morality.

I'm a preacher. But beyond the preaching part, establishment of justice provided for the common defense, promoting the general welfare issue and domestic tranquility, equal protection under the law. When you look at these glaring statistics, even before COVID, we weren't shocked.

So after COVID, some people still think it's other, it's over there. I'm concerned even and I say this as an African-American that we are not getting the data on poverty. We're not getting the data on zip code. I believe when we get the full data we're going to see yes it is killing African-Americans at enormous levels, but it's also killing poor white folk in Appalachia at enormous levels and they don't have what they need.

That's why we have been pulling together this poor people's campaign, a national call for a moral revival over the last three years, because we recognized years ago America needed a moral revival, a moral revolution of values. If we have a conscious awakening, a shaking, a restarting of the very heart of our nation because we are in trouble when it comes to our consciousness. It Is far too dull and we accept it far too much.",1
392,392,488,Elon Musk says shelter-in-place orders during COVID-19 are ‘fascist’,"Elon Musk called the shelter-in-place orders in the San Francisco Bay Area and throughout the US “fascist” actions that are stripping people of their freedom on a Tesla earnings call on Wednesday. Musk’s comments come after a torrent of criticism for remarks he made late Tuesday night on Twitter, in which the billionaire CEO echoed President Trump by writing in all caps, “Free America Now.”

The rant began after Musk said, “We are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area, and that should be identified as a serious risk.” Six Bay Area counties jointly extended the shelter-in-place orders affecting San Francisco, Fremont, and other cities through May 31st, with only some minor relaxing of restrictions.

“Give people back their goddamn freedom.”

“The expansion of shelter-in-place, or as we call it, forcibly imprisoning people in their homes, against all their constitutional rights, is, in my opinion, breaking people’s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong, and not why people came to America and built this country,” Musk said. “What the fuck!”

“If somebody wants to stay in the house that’s great,” Musk continued. “They should be allowed to stay in the house and they should not be compelled to leave. But to say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do... this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom.”

FREE AMERICA NOW — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 29, 2020

Tesla’s primary factory is located in Fremont, California, and after initially attempting to fight county orders listing the car maker as non-essential, Musk ultimately did close down the facility alongside the company’s Buffalo solar panel plant. Although Musk kept the factory open for five days after the initial shelter-in-place order, Tesla defied the order once more last week by asking some Fremont factory employees to return to work. (The company’s Nevada Gigafactory remains open, despite the state’s governor ordering all non-essential businesses to close.)

Musk said on the call that Tesla would be fine after the COVID-19 crisis, but that small companies would not. “Everything people have worked for all their lives is being destroyed in real time,” he said of the state orders to close non-essential businesses. “I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry.”

Musk has been an outspoken critic of some of the safety measures instituted in the US due to the coronavirus pandemic, primarily taking issue with the state-ordered shelter-in-place guidance that has shut down large swaths of the economy. But Musk’s criticism has at times extended beyond concern for the economy and job market. He has questioned basic coronavirus science and made incorrect projections about the severity of the virus, predicting there would be few US cases by the end of April. Right now, there are about 25,000 new cases confirmed daily, and that is almost certainly an undercount, since there are problems with testing capacity.

As The Verge’s Russell Brandom chronicled earlier today, Musk now has a troubled history with his public communications around COVID-19:

9,9,24,Philippines and Singapore Testing Coconut Oil as Possible Treatment for Coronavirus,"Coconut oil eyed as possible treatment for coronavirus infection

by CNN Philippines Staff

Excerpts:

Coconut oil, whose health benefits have been proven in the past, will be tested for use as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus infection.

“That [VCO] is being looked into,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III told CNN Philippines’ Newsroom on Tuesday.

“We have heard very good studies with regard to its ability to neutralize the viruses, but for the COVID- 19, it is not clear,” the top health official added.

He made the reaction following Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles’ announcement Monday that a former academician from one of the country’s top universities proposed to test coconut oil as COVID-19 treatment amid the absence of a specific treatment.

In a research proposal published on January 31, Ateneo de Manila University Professor Emeritus Fabian Antonio Dayrit and Dr. Mary Newport of Spring Hill Neonatolody in Florida, United States proposed to conduct a clinical study on patients infected with the COVID-19 involving VCO, saying “this treatment is affordable and virtually risk-free, and the potential benefits are enormous.” Nograles said the National University of Singapore has agreed to test VCO as a prophylactic against the COVID-19.

Current evidence suggests coconut oil and its derivatives are safe and effective antiviral compounds in both humans and animals, the researchers noted.

“Several in vitro, animal, and human studies support the potential of coconut oil, lauric acid and its derivatives as effective and safe agents against a virus like nCoV-2019 [COVID-19],” they said.

387,387,480,Putin extends non-working days as Russia is ranked 8th in Covid-19 cases,"Putin extends isolation as Russia ranked 8th in Covid-19 cases

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a new extension of “non-working days” that were declared nationwide in order to combat the spread of coronavirus infection COVID-19. Without waiting for the expiration of the previous deadline (April 30), Putin announced that all days through May 11 would be non-working days in Russia.

Traditionally, Russians celebrate May holidays from May 1 till May 9 with just a few working days between them. Many prefer to take a few days off to spend a full-fledged ten-day vacation to spend it either abroad or working in gardens.

Putin explained the need to prolong the tough measures to combat COVID-19 with the fact that the epidemic in Russia has not reached its peak yet.

“We are now facing a new, perhaps the most intense stage of the fight against the epidemic. All of us will need utmost composure, discipline and mobilization. We must make sure that the wave of the epidemic subsides and finally declines,” Putin said.

Anna Popova, the head of Rospotrebnadzor (environmental watchdog), noted that during the new period of non-working days one should maintain the self-isolation regime and other restrictions.

“This is the third incubation period for the entire period of non-working days that should interrupt the chain of transmission of the virus,” Popova said.

She said earlier that stringent restrictions need to be extended for at least another two weeks.

“We can’t stop halfway. So far, we have been in the phase of severe restrictive measures for only two incubation periods for this disease. In order to stop the spread of the virus and be completely sure that we will pass the point of no return, this is absolutely not enough,” Popova said.

On March 25, in his televised address to the nation in connection with the fight against the spread of coronavirus infection COVID-19, the president declared a non-working week from March 30 to April 5. On April 2, the president made a new appeal to the nation, having extended the non-working regime until April 30.

On April 28, it became known that Russia left Iran behind and took the 8th place in the world in the number of officially registered patients with COVID-19. As of April 27, 93,558 cases of COVID-19 were recorded in the country (+6411 over the last 24 hours), 867 people died.",0
193,193,263,Chicago’s storefront theaters hoping curtains will rise again once coronavirus shutdown lifts,"The new normal for Chicago theater consists of an ongoing attempt to predict the future. A crystal ball would come in handy.

To say the coronavirus crisis has thrown theaters big and small into unprecedented turmoil is an understatement. Every theater has been jolted by the mandated shutdown of all non-essential businesses.

Taking the hardest hit in the theater community (outside of creatives who’ve lost their jobs) are the storefront organizations, most operating on a shoestring budget with nowhere near the deeper pockets of larger theater companies.

The stay-at-home edict came as many Chicago theaters were ready to open new productions and others were about to begin rehearsals for shows slated to debut in late April or May.

Other plays, caught in the middle of a run, were canceled, with a handful able to offer online streaming for ticket holders.

Many theaters also had major spring fundraisers postponed, canceled or moved online.

Some welcome relief came with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s announcement of the Arts for Illinois Relief Fund to provide financial assistance to artists, artisans and cultural organizations.

“We’re very grateful that so many people and organizations have come together to support the arts at this time,” said Leda Hoffmann, artistic direct of Strawdog Theatre, with an operating budget of $250,000. “There are still a lot of unknowns about the long-term effect of these closures on small organizations like us, but we know relief is needed now, and I’m glad we can get started.”

The League of Chicago Theatres says 93 of its 237 members have budgets of under $75,000 a year. At these smaller companies, one show’s revenue often helps pay for the next.

Strawdog’s staging of Brian James Polak’s “Welcome to Keene, New Hampshire” was set to begin April 17. Rehearsals were moved online, as was a fundraiser, but the show is postponed.

Hoffmann said it’s a scary time for storefront theaters, but she’s “grateful to have the flexibility of a smaller organization. Small theaters have always been able to find a way somehow. The finances are the big struggle, but the will is very much there.”

At Griffin Theatre, whose annual operating budget is around $400,000, the final two weekends of “Mlima’s Tale” (usually a show’s most lucrative dates) were canceled, as were two tours of the company’s highly successful children’s shows: “The Stinky Cheese Man” and “Frindle.” Artistic director Bill Massolia said the tours are a loss of $60,000 to $70,000.

Griffin has an online fundraising campaign going to raise money to pay the “Milma’s Tale” artists through the end of the run and finance the company through July.

“If we can just get through the summer, that will give us the breathing room to be able to figure out a strategy for the fall,” Massolia said. “This is all a little bit overwhelming.”

At Raven Theatre, which is also a rental house, artistic director Cody Estle said, “I’m wearing tracks into my wood floors because I keep pacing.”

Over the past few years, Raven, with an operating budget of $750,000, worked on making sure there were some reserves, Estle said. “But when I say reserves for a theater our size, it’s not very much. It could cover us for eight weeks or so.”

Broken Nose Theatre artistic director Elise Marie Davis said her biggest fear is that some companies won’t be able to bounce back. Broken Nose moved this season’s final show, Eric Reyes Loo’s “This Is Only a Test,” to next season. Davis said the company’s operating budget is “under six figures.”

“I think we’re going to see a very different theater scene moving forward,” she said. “My big fear is this will be a death sentence for some non-Equity theaters.”

How quickly will theatergoers, many of them older, return when the OK is given?

“Perhaps smaller spaces will be allowed to open firs,t” said League of Chicago Theatres executive director Deb Clapp. “Their audiences skew younger than some others, so maybe those audiences will be more willing to go back to the theater sooner. They may be in the best position for recovery. But, of course, that is all conjecture.”

Rivendell Theatre artistic director Tara Mallen said: “I am so encouraged by how much we have actually been able to accomplish online over these past three weeks — the play readings, the production meetings, the classes we have continued to teach. We are still working at Rivendell, still crafting stories that need to be shared and lifting up voices that need to be heard.”

665,665,810,He Was a Science Star. Then He Promoted a Questionable Cure for Covid-19.,"
When diagnosing the ills afflicting modern science, an entertainment that, along with the disparagement of his critics and fellow researchers, he counts among his great delights, the eminent French microbiologist Didier Raoult will lightly stroke his beard, lean back in his seat and, with a thin but unmistakable smile, declare the poor patient to be stricken with pride. Raoult, who has achieved international fame since his proposed treatment for Covid-19 was touted as a miracle cure by President Trump, believes that his colleagues fail to see that their ideas are the products of mere intellectual fashions — that they are hypnotized by methodology into believing that they understand what they do not and that they lack the discipline of mind that would permit them to comprehend their error. “Hubris,” Raoult told me recently, at his institute in Marseille, “is the most common thing in the world.” It is a particularly dangerous malady in doctors like him, whose opinions are freighted with the responsibility of life and death. “Someone who doesn’t know is less stupid than someone who wrongly thinks he does,” he said. “Because it is a terrible thing to be wrong.”
Raoult, who founded and directs the research hospital known as the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, or IHU, has made a great career assailing orthodoxy, in both word and practice. “There’s nothing I like more than blowing up a theory that’s been so nicely established,” he once said. He has a reputation for bluster but also for a certain creativity. He looks where no one else cares to, with methods no one else is using, and finds things. In just the past 10 years, he has helped identify nearly 500 novel species of human-borne bacteria, about one-fifth of all those named and described. Until recently, he was perhaps best known as the discoverer of the first giant virus, a microbe that, in his opinion, suggests that viruses ought to be considered a fourth and separate domain of living things. The discovery helped win him the Grand Prix Inserm, one of France’s top scientific prizes. It also led him to believe that the tree of life suggested by Darwinian evolution is “entirely false,” he told me, and that Darwin himself “wrote nothing but inanities.” He detests consensus and comity; he believes that science, and life, ought to be a fight.
It is in this spirit that, over the objections of his peers, and no doubt because of them, too, he has promoted a combination of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, and azithromycin, a common antibiotic, as a remedy for Covid-19. He has taken to declaring, “We know how to cure the disease.” Trump was not the only one eager to embrace this possibility. By the time I arrived in Marseille, some version of Raoult’s treatment regimen had been authorized for testing or use in France, Italy, China, India and numerous other countries. One in every five registered drug trials in the world was testing hydroxychloroquine.
In March, Raoult announced that his hospital would test and treat anyone who cared to show up. Crowds gathered at the entrance to the IHU in winding single-file lines, like pilgrims shuffling toward their private audience with the oracle. On March 16, Raoult released the results of a small clinical trial that showed, he said, a 100 percent cure rate. The study has since been widely debated, and Raoult’s boosterism has been lamented by scientists and health officials around the world; in a comment more or less representative of the tenor of the controversy in France, where Raoult’s name and image have now been everywhere for weeks, one detractor, a generally thoughtful politician, suggested that Raoult “shut his face and be a doctor” and that he “stop saying ‘I’m a genius’ all over the place.”
His colleagues liken his psychology to that of Napoleon, though he is not physically small. When asked by one journalist about his tendency to “swim against the current” of scientific thought, Raoult responded: “I’m not an ‘outsider.’ I’m the one who’s farthest out in front.” Axel Kahn, a geneticist and physician who has known Raoult for nearly 40 years, told me that he has always been this way. “One of Professor Raoult’s abiding characteristics is that he knows that he’s very good,” Kahn told me. “But he considers everyone else to be worthless. And he always has. It’s not a recent development.” At his home, alongside a collection of Roman busts, he is said to keep a marble statue of himself.
Raoult, who is 68, is a sturdily built but fine-featured man, with high cheekbones and a tight, contemptuous mouth. In recent years, he has hidden these behind a straggly white mustache and goatee and has grown his flaxen hair down to his shoulders. On his right pinkie he now wears a silver skull. In internet memes, he has been depicted as the wizard Gandalf and as a druid; except for his white lab coat, he has the general aspect of a fortuneteller who rides a Harley to work. The French journalist Hervé Vaudoit, who has written admiringly about Raoult over the years, once asked him why he’d taken to dressing this way. Raoult replied, “Because it pisses them off.”
In the weeks since SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, spread throughout the world, his disdain for respectable opinion, and for the “Parisian marquesses” who are its representatives, has endeared him to a large segment of the French population. According to one survey, by late March, Raoult had become one of France’s most popular “political personalities,” with particular appeal on the populist extremes. Votives bearing his image were being sold in Marseille, and on some evenings, at 8 p.m., a battalion of municipal garbage trucks assembled on the roadway outside his hospital, where the drivers leaned on their horns in loud and furious tribute. A hundred-foot banner, painted by a club of local soccer fans and strung up near the entrance, read, “Marseille and the world behind Prof. Raoult!!!”
Raoult has been collecting the merchandise created by his fans, and he seems to be enjoying his fame, though he claims otherwise. He is certain the drugs will vindicate him in the end; everything else is a matter of appearances. “I really do think we’re in a theater,” he told me. “In my play, the people who judge me as a doctor are my patients. As a scientist, it’s my colleagues. And time.”
A few weeks ago, I spoke, from the recommended distance, to a man named Jacques Cohen. He was seated on the sidewalk outside the IHU, an angular monument of concrete and glass about a mile and a half from Marseille’s old port. Cohen had his back against a pylon and his wrists on his knees, at the edge of a group of perhaps 60 people. By their unworried proximity to one another — they were standing around in a loose group, as people used to, waiting to enter the hospital through a side door — they were identifiable as the unfortunates who already knew they were positive. I had selected Cohen as my interlocutor under the guidance of a nearby nurse. He was not coughing or sneezing; he wore a mask. “In any case, we’re all going to get it,” the nurse said.
I crouched on the pavement and asked Cohen, who is 76, how he was feeling. For the past two days, he had been taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. “It’s getting better,” Cohen said through his mask. He looked ashen but optimistic. His fever had fallen, and he had begun to regain his sense of taste. I noted that there was some debate about the efficacy of the treatment. “There’s no ‘believing’ or ‘not believing,’” Cohen replied. “We know it’s effective!”
Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are well characterized, well tolerated and widely prescribed medications. Azithromycin was developed 40 years ago in the former Yugoslavia and is today the second-most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the United States. Hydroxychloroquine, along with its more toxic analog chloroquine, was for several decades the most commonly prescribed antimalarial drug in the world. Today it is widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. All three molecules are included on the World Health Organization’s Model List of Essential Medicines, a compilation of “the most efficacious, safe and cost-effective medicines for priority conditions.”
Raoult knows the drugs well. From the start of his career, he has experimented extensively with drug repositioning, in which medicines that have been approved for use against one disease are repurposed as treatments for others. Hundreds and hundreds of molecules have already been approved for human use by the Food and Drug Administration. Hidden among these, Raoult contends, are various unanticipated cures. “You test everything,” Raoult told me. “You stop pondering; you just look and see if, by chance, something works. And what you find by chance, it’ll knock you on your derrière.” Antidepressants and antihypertensives have been shown to have antiviral properties; lovastatin, which is prescribed to lower cholesterol levels, has been found to be effective, at least in mice, against plague. In a 2018 paper, Raoult and a team of researchers reported that azithromycin showed strong activity in cells infected with the Zika virus.
Raoult spent the first decade of his life in Dakar, in what was then French Senegal, where his father, a military doctor, was posted. To ward off malaria, he was given chloroquine. “I took it all the time when I was a kid,” he told me. In the 1990s, in an early repurposing experiment, he tested the effect of hydroxychloroquine on a frequently fatal condition known as Q fever, which is caused by an intracellular bacterium. Like viruses, intracellular bacteria multiply within the cells of their hosts; Raoult found that hydroxychloroquine, by reducing acidity within the host cells, slowed bacterial growth. He began treating Q fever with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and doxycycline and later used the same drugs for Whipple’s disease, another fatal condition caused by an intracellular bacterium. The combination is now considered to be a standard treatment for both diseases.
Given the similarities between intracellular bacteria and viruses, Raoult suspected that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might have antiviral effects. Following the SARS outbreak in 2002, researchers found that chloroquine slowed reproduction of the SARS coronavirus in cell cultures. Raoult reviewed that evidence in a 2007 paper, concluding that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might be “an interesting weapon to face present and future infectious diseases worldwide.” This winter, as the spread of SARS-CoV-2 began to take on the contours of a pandemic, he surveyed the data that had begun coming out of China. An early report on chloroquine showed good results in vitro. In mid-February, another Chinese team reported that, in more than 100 patients, it had been found to have “potent activity against Covid-19.” Raoult was elated.
At the time, health authorities around the world were warning that a viable treatment could be months away. The Chinese reports, however, appeared to confirm Raoult’s longstanding hopes for chloroquine. A deadly virus for which no treatment existed could evidently be stopped by an inexpensive, widely studied, pre-existing molecule, and one that Raoult knew well. A more heedful scientist might have surveyed the Chinese data and begun preparations for tests of his own. Raoult did this, but he also posted a brief, jubilant video on YouTube, under the title “Coronavirus: Game Over!” Chloroquine had produced what he called “spectacular improvements” in the Chinese patients. “It’s excellent news — this is probably the easiest respiratory infection to treat of all,” Raoult said. “The only thing I’ll tell you is, be careful: Soon the pharmacies won’t have any chloroquine left!”
Raoult has spent nearly his entire life in Marseille, a famously ragged and combative city, which he loves. He named a genus of bacteria, Massilia, for it and has given its name or the names of its neighborhoods to numerous other species of microbe. Marseille has been a major port for more than 2,000 years and has a correspondingly rich history of disease. It was the point of entry into France for all three of the great waves of bubonic plague, beginning in the sixth century. Between 1720 and 1722, the plague killed about half of Marseille’s population; one of its central neighborhoods, on the old port, is today named for the bishop who tended to the ill while the city’s doctors hid in fear.
Raoult wrote his first research paper, in 1979, on a tick-borne infection sometimes known as Marseille fever. The disease was also called “benign summer fever,” and more than 50 years of science said it was nonlethal. And yet one of the 41 patients in his data set had died. Before submitting the paper, Raoult, who was then a young resident, gave it to a supervising professor for review. “And he takes it,” Raoult told me, “he doesn’t show it to me again, and he publishes it — and he’d taken out the death. Because he didn’t know how to make sense of the death.” Raoult was disgusted, and the incident shaped his philosophy of scientific inquiry. “I learned that the people who wanted to follow the familiar path were prepared to cheat in order to do it,” he said. In subsequent work, he demonstrated that Marseille fever was indeed fatal in almost precisely one in every 41 cases. “He was a ‘follower,’” Raoult said of the professor. “And these ‘followers’ are all cheaters. That’s what I thought. And it’s still what I think.”
He is, fundamentally, a contrarian. In Raoult’s view, little of consequence has been accomplished by researchers who endorse the habitual tools and theories of their age. “I’ve spent my life being ‘against,’” he told me. “I tell young scientists: ‘You know, you don’t need a brain to agree. All you need is a spinal cord.’” He is thrilled by conflict. It is a matter both of philosophy — the influence, no doubt, of the thinker he refers to admiringly as “master Nietzsche” — and of temperament. “He loves to know that things are roiling around him,” one of his lab technicians told me; he sets off storms and admires them as they roll out over the land. His peers shake their heads at this behavior but grant him a grudging respect. “You can’t knock him down,” said Mark Pallen, a professor of microbial genomics at the University of East Anglia. “In terms of his place in the canon, the sainthood of science, he’s pretty secure there.”
He is also interested in power and has been attentive to it from the start. In 1985 and 1986, Raoult worked at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, Md., where he discovered the Science Citation Index. The index, a tool that can be used to measure a scientist’s influence on the basis of his or her publication history, was relatively unknown in France. Raoult looked up the researchers reputed to be the best in Marseille. “It was really the emperor wears no clothes,” he said. “These people didn’t publish. There was one who hadn’t written a paper in 10 years.” In Raoult’s view, French science was a duchy of appearances, connections and self-reverence. “It was people saying” — he mimed the drone of an aristocrat — “ ‘Oh, him, yes, he’s very good.’ And this reputation, you don’t know what it’s based on, but it’s not the truth.”
For decades, Raoult has boasted of his prodigious rates of publication and citation, which, as objective statistics, he considers to be the best measure of his worth as a researcher. Biomedical researchers in France write or contribute to perhaps 10 scientific papers every year and a few hundred in the course of a career. Raoult’s name sits atop several thousand; in each of the past eight years, he has produced more than 100. In 2020, he has already published at least 54.
Raoult is reputed to be an indefatigable worker, but he also achieves his extreme rate of publication by attaching his name to nearly every paper that comes out of his institute. Though the practice is not unheard-of, it is unusual. “Even to just read those papers would take up a large percentage of anyone’s time,” Pallen told me. “For someone like me to actually go through them carefully, critique them, make a substantial intellectual contribution — I think that would be practically impossible.”
With few exceptions, the department heads at the IHU have worked under Raoult for their entire careers, some for more than 30 years. It is an “ancestral system,” “familial” and “clanlike,” said Michel Drancourt, a clinician who is Raoult’s longest-serving collaborator. Raoult is, without question, the patriarch, and he is in some respects reputed to be benevolent. The IHU spends a great deal of money on scholarships and research grants for students from the developing world, for instance, and Raoult is known to be accessible to young researchers in a way that distinguishes him from other high-powered scientists. He is also known for berating his subordinates. While visiting the IHU, I watched a young researcher emerge from Raoult’s office in tears and rush into the arms of her friends, who were evidently accustomed to this. “When he’s not happy about something, he’ll let you know,” one of them told me. A 2017 employee letter of complaint, which was followed by an investigation of the IHU, described the “screaming,” “insults” and “psychological bullying” of a “leadership of another era.” Along the entryway to Raoult’s institute, there’s a line from Horace: Exegi monumentum aere perennius, “I have crafted a monument more lasting than bronze.”
In recent years, Raoult has amused himself, it seems, by staking out tendentious scientific claims, sometimes in territories that are well beyond the scope of his expertise. He is skeptical, for instance, of the utility of mathematical modeling in the realm of epidemiology. The same logic has led him to conclude that climate modelers are no more than “soothsayers” for our “scientistic era” and that their dire predictions are mostly just an attempt to expiate our intense but irrational feelings of guilt.
He is also dismissive of the alarmism that is the default position among specialists of infectious disease. He doubted, initially, that SARS-CoV-2 would spread beyond China, or that it might be a terrible problem if it did. On Jan. 20, Chinese scientists confirmed that infections were being transmitted from patient to patient, and President Xi Jinping, in his first public comments about the coronavirus, declared that all possible measures would have to be taken to contain the outbreak. The World Health Organization announced an emergency meeting. The following day, in Marseille, Raoult posted a video to his institute’s YouTube channel. He faced his offscreen interviewer with weary eyes, sighed and said, “You know, the world has gone crazy.” Every year, he said, there are probably 600 or 700 people who die from coronavirus infections in France and thousands more from other respiratory illnesses. “The fact that people have died from a coronavirus in China, I don’t feel like it means much of anything for me,” he said. “I don’t know, maybe people don’t have anything to do, so they’ve gone looking in China for something to be scared about.”
Raoult’s most recent book, “Epidemics: Real Dangers and False Alerts,” was published in late March, by which time the W.H.O. had reported more than 330,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 worldwide and more than 14,500 deaths. “This anguish over epidemics,” he writes, “is completely untethered from the reality of deaths from infectious diseases.”
By the standards of molecular biology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, the technology most commonly used to test for SARS-CoV-2, is not extravagantly complex. But it depends upon collection swabs, thermocycling machines, chemical reagents and nucleotide probes and primers, and if any one of these components is in insufficient supply, the tests cannot be run. Beginning in January, when the SARS-CoV-2 genome was first published, the IHU bought or borrowed as much of all these as possible, spending a half million euros on new machines alone. Whatever Raoult’s reservations about the virus, he did not intend to miss the opportunity to study it, and perhaps to win the race to find a treatment. His institute receives most of its funding from public sources — Raoult was given 130 million euros to build it — but it effectively controls its own budget, and Raoult, as the founding director, has near-complete control of what goes on inside its walls. “He can essentially say, ‘Hold on, I want to turn the bedroom and the dining room into a kitchen,’” Drancourt said.
Nearly 800 people work at the institute. In early March, as coronavirus patients began arriving, almost all the staff members turned their efforts to SARS-CoV-2. Raoult obtained authorization to begin a small clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine. Because viral respiratory infections often lead to secondary bacterial infections, however, Raoult wanted to test a supplementary antibiotic in some patients; he chose azithromycin, which he had previously tested against Zika. “If you’re going to choose one, you might as well choose one that’s been shown to be active against a virus,” said Bernard La Scola, who runs the biosafety lab at the IHU.
Hydroxychloroquine is believed to inhibit viral reproduction in infected cells by raising their pH, as in Q fever and Whipple’s disease; the antiviral mechanism of azithromycin has not been explained. But what works works. If we relied only upon medications with precisely established mechanisms, a number of popular drugs — acetaminophen, for instance, the active ingredient in Tylenol — would not be in use. I asked Raoult if the idea to test the drugs together had emerged from discussions with his team. “It was me,” he told me. “Don’t kid yourself.”
Testing had been scheduled to run for two weeks per patient, but after only six days, the results were so favorable that Raoult decided to end the trial and publish. “Usually, we’d take time to write, to make corrections, to consider, to go over things 50 times,” said Philippe Gautret, the department head who was the first listed author on the paper. “In this case, we were working with a sense of real urgency. Because we thought we had to get the word out, because, maybe, we’d found a way to make things better.”
Others might have proceeded with more caution or perhaps waited to confirm these results with a larger, more rigorous trial. Raoult likes to think of himself as a doctor first, however, with a moral obligation to treat his patients that supersedes any desire to produce reliable data. “We’re not going to tell someone, ‘Listen, today’s not your lucky day, you’re getting the placebo, you’re going to be dying,’” he told me. He believes it to be unnecessary, in addition to being unethical, to run randomized controlled trials, or R.C.T.s, of treatments for deadly infectious diseases. If these have become the accepted standard in biomedical research, Raoult contends, it is only because they appeal to statisticians “who have never seen a patient.” He refers to these scientists disdainfully as “methodologists.”
Raoult’s paper included results for 36 patients. Fourteen were treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate; six were treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and azithromycin; and 16 served as controls. On Day 6 of the trial, 14 of the 16 control patients still tested positive for the virus. Patients receiving hydroxychloroquine fared markedly better, with only six of 14 testing positive on Day 6. Most encouraging, though, all six patients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were found to be rid of the virus.
Several prominent French doctors cautioned that the results would have to be confirmed and warned of possible side effects. The French health minister deemed the trial promising but called for more testing. Raoult had already begun assembling data for a larger study, but he dismissed the need for anything particularly vast or lengthy. Like other critics of the R.C.T., he likes to point out that a number of self-evidently useful developments in the realm of human health have never been validated by such rigorous tests. This observation has come to be known as the parachute paradigm: We tend to accept the claim that parachutes reduce injury among people who leap from airplanes, but this effect has never been proved in a randomized study that compares an experimental parachute group to an unlucky parachuteless control. “It’s like Didier says,” Drancourt told me. “If you don’t have something that’s visible in 10 patients, or 30, it’s useless. It’s not of any consequence.” An effective treatment for a potentially lethal infectious disease will be visible to the naked eye.
On March 16, a Long Island attorney and blockchain enthusiast named Gregory Rigano appeared on Laura Ingraham’s nightly show on Fox News, “The Ingraham Angle.” Ingraham introduced the segment by asking: “What if there’s already a cheap and widely available medication, that’s on the market, to treat the virus? Well, according to a new study, there is such a drug. It’s called chloroquine.” Rigano, who at the time was falsely presenting himself as an adviser to Stanford Medical School, had recently self-published an acclamatory report on the potential of chloroquine, “An Effective Treatment for Coronavirus (Covid-19),” as a Google Doc formatted to resemble a scientific publication. It had begun to circulate in right-wing media and also in Silicon Valley; Elon Musk tweeted a link to it. Raoult saw it and noticed the attention it was receiving online. Another researcher might have found this sort of publication irresponsible and dangerous. Raoult began corresponding with Rigano and his co-author, James Todaro, an ophthalmologist and Bitcoin investor. Raoult authorized them to share his results before they had been published.
On air, Rigano announced that a researcher in the south of France, “one of the most eminent infectious-disease specialists in the whole world,” was about to publish the results of a major clinical study. “Within a matter of six days, the patients taking hydroxychloroquine tested negative for coronavirus, for Covid-19,” Rigano said. (He made no mention of azithromycin.) “We have a strong reason to believe that a preventative dose of hydroxychloroquine is going to prevent the virus from attaching to the body, and just get rid of it completely,” he added. “That’s a game changer,” Ingraham said.
In the coming days, Ingraham questioned both Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of President Trump’s pandemic task force, and Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, about the drug. Sean Hannity began promoting it as a cure for Covid-19. “Let’s put it this way,” he said on his radio show. “If I had it — personally, I am speaking only for Sean Hannity — I would be all over this.” Rigano appeared on Tucker Carlson’s show and claimed that Raoult’s study had shown hydroxychloroquine to have a “100 percent cure rate against coronavirus.” According to Todaro, Raoult had sent him a copy of his study and allowed him to post it on Twitter that day, two days before the preprint release. “I suspect he gave us permission because he knew it was the fastest way to disseminate the trial results,” Todaro told me. (Rigano did not respond to requests for comment.) Later, Raoult himself appeared on “Dr. Oz,” the talk show hosted by the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, a frequent Fox News guest who has promoted hydroxychloroquine. “I believe that ideas and theories are epidemic,” Raoult once wrote. “When they’re good, they take root.”
Trump began hyping hydroxychloroquine on March 19, at a White House news conference with his coronavirus task force. “I think it’s going to be very exciting,” Trump said. “I think it could be a game changer and maybe not. And maybe not. But I think it could be, based on what I see, it could be a game changer. Very powerful.” He suggested, inaccurately, that the F.D.A. had approved the drug for use against Covid-19. He made no mention of azithromycin. Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn of the F.D.A. gently corrected him later and said that a large clinical trial would be the appropriate way to evaluate the therapeutic value of the drug.
Still, because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are available for use in other conditions, doctors were able to provide Covid-19 patients with “off-label” treatment if they believed it would provide a benefit. Shortages of the drugs were reported beginning in mid-March. The F.D.A., under what appears to have been strong pressure from the Trump administration, issued an emergency-use authorization for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, giving doctors access to tens of millions of doses of the drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile. Unusually, the C.D.C., at what was reportedly Trump’s direct urging, issued Covid-19 prescription guidelines for the drugs based upon unattributed clinical anecdotes. (The guidelines were later withdrawn.) A top government biomedical official was removed from his post, he has claimed, for having resisted political pressure to fund “potentially dangerous drugs,” including hydroxychloroquine.
There is much about Raoult that might make him, and by extension his proposed treatment, appealing to a man like Trump. He is an iconoclast with funny hair; he thinks almost everyone else is stupid, especially those who are typically regarded as smart; he is beloved by the angry and conspiracy-minded; his self-congratulation is more or less unceasing. Raoult and I spoke several days after the emergency-use authorization was signed. He said he hadn’t heard about it and seemed surprised, but he also said that Trump had impressed him with his intuition on hydroxychloroquine. “He’s not so dumb,” he said, laughing. Raoult classified Trump’s psychology as that of an “entrepreneur,” by way of contrast with that of a “politician.” “Entrepreneurs are people who know how to decide, who know how to take risks,” he said. “And at a certain point, to decide is to take a risk. Every decision is a risk.”
The French waited far too long, in his estimation, to approve the use of hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients. The authorization came only after Raoult announced in the press that he would continue, “in accordance with the Hippocratic oath” and effectively in defiance of the government, to treat patients with his combination therapy. “I’m convinced that in the end, everyone will be using this treatment,” Raoult told Le Parisien. “It’s just a matter of time before people agree to eat their hats.”
The dynamics of a crisis are not especially conducive to reliable science. In October 1985, in the terrible early years of the AIDS epidemic, a group of French doctors, joined by the French minister of social affairs, held a news conference to announce to the world that they had discovered what looked like a cure. The drug was cyclosporine, an inexpensive immunosuppressant that had until then been used in organ transplants to prevent the rejection of new tissue. In AIDS patients, cyclosporine had the paradoxical effect of increasing white-blood-cell counts; patients underwent a “spectacular improvement,” one researcher said. The announcement was based upon results from only two patients, however, and these patients had begun treatment only one week earlier. The scientists were widely criticized at the time for flouting the norms of biomedical research to report such limited data. “Given the strength of our hypotheses,” they responded, “we believe that, ethically, we could not continue to keep our results a secret just to respect the usual laws of scientific conduct.”
“Like Raoult, they felt very strongly about what they said,” said Jean-Michel Molina, who directs the infectious-disease departments at two public hospitals in Paris. “They felt that they had found a cure.” Shortly after the announcement, one of the two patients died, and it was revealed that a third patient had died before the news conference; he had been excluded from the reported results because his case was considered too grave to reverse. Within weeks, the remaining patient’s white-blood-cell count had fallen to its previous level. Experimentation with cyclosporine soon stopped.
Like many doctors, Molina viewed Raoult’s study with skepticism, but he was also curious to see if his proposed treatment regimen might in fact work. He tested hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 11 of his own patients. “We had severe patients, and we wanted t",1
618,618,752,Becoming ‘King of Ventilators’ may result in unexpected glut,"WASHINGTON — As requests for ventilators from the national stockpile reached a crescendo in late March, President Donald Trump made what seemed like a bold claim: His administration would have 100,000 within 100 days.

At the time, the Department of Health and Human Services had not ordered any new ventilators since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in January. But records show that over the following three weeks, the agency scrambled to turn Trump’s pledge into a reality, spending nearly $3 billion to spur U.S. manufacturers to crank out the breathing machines at an unprecedented pace.

An analysis of federal contracting data by The Associated Press shows the agency is now on track to exceed 100,000 new ventilators by around July 13, about a week later than the 100-day deadline Trump first gave on March 27.

By the end of 2020, the administration is expected to take delivery of nearly 200,000 new ventilators, based on the AP’s review of current federal purchasing contracts. That would more than double the estimated 160,000 ventilators hospitals across the U.S. had before the pandemic.

“We became the king of ventilators, thousands and thousands of ventilators,” Trump boasted in an April 29 speech.

But over the past month, demand for ventilators has decreased even as the U.S. death toll from the novel coronavirus has surged past 80,000. After observing unusually high death rates for coronavirus victims who were put on ventilators, many doctors are using them only as a last resort.

That’s raising the unexpected prospect that the United States could soon be awash in surplus ventilators, so much so the White House is now planning to ship thousands overseas to help boost the virus response of other nations.

In a speech to Republican members of Congress on Friday, the president credited his son-in-law, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, with heading up the effort to purchase the ventilators.

“We built, and we built, and we built,” Trump said. “Now we have nine factories that are throwing out ventilators at numbers that nobody can believe. It was really — there’s not been anything like that, since the Second World War, where we did the same thing with other types of product.”

Daniel Adelman, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who teaches health care analytics, said the U.S. government is now buying more than twice the number of ventilators it needs, even under a worst-case scenario forecasting the spread of COVID-19.

But Adelman said mathematical models cannot predict with certainty how many ventilators will be needed if there is a resurgence of the coronavirus later in the year or if there is another pandemic in the future.

“It seems incongruent with the forecasts that you’re seeing,” Adelman said of the government purchases. “I’d probably rather they order too many rather than ordering too few.”

In patients with severe cases of COVID-19, the virus attacks the lungs, causing fluid to collect in tiny air sacs called alveoli. That makes it difficult for the lungs to transfer oxygen from the air to the blood, which can be deadly. To treat these low oxygen levels, doctors have historically relied on ventilators.

The Strategic National Stockpile, the federal government’s emergency reserve of medical supplies, had about 16,660 ventilators ready to deploy at the start of March, with an additional 2,400 out for maintenance.

By the middle of the month, health officials and governors in states with the worst virus outbreaks began expressing concerns that the supply of breathing machines could run out, potentially leaving thousands of critically ill patients gasping for air.

Among those calling for additional ventilators was Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.), who predicted on March 24 that all of the ventilators in his state would be in use, and patients in need would be left without proper treatment. Cuomo said projections showed New York would need at least 30,000 additional ventilators to get through the mid-April peak of the outbreak. At that point, FEMA had sent New York 400.

Trump expressed skepticism at Cuomo’s figures even as his administration rushed to send New York 4,000 additional ventilators — about one-quarter of the nation’s entire emergency stockpile. Still, Cuomo pleaded for more.

“You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die,” Cuomo said at a news conference,

It wasn’t just New York, however. Similarly dire projections of a ventilator shortfall were also then circulating within the White House.

“The scariest day of my life was about a month ago when, after a long day of meetings, my team told me that we were going to be needing 130,000 ventilators; that we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators,” Trump recounted in an April 14 briefing. “I had governors requesting unreasonable sums that the federal government just didn’t have.”

By late March, a bipartisan chorus of state governors and members of Congress were calling on the president to exercise his emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to force U.S. companies to produce ventilators.

Trump had resisted invoking the Korean War-era law, which grants the president sole authority to direct U.S. industrial production of critical supplies in times of national emergency, saying the private sector was stepping up production of ventilators and other medical supplies on its own.

But on March 27, Trump changed course, announcing that he would invoke the Defense Production Act to produce ventilators, which meant companies would have to give priority to federal orders over other customers.

“In the next 100 days — well, first of all, we’ve already delivered thousands of them — but within the next 100 days, we will either make or get, in some form, over 100,000 additional units,” Trump said.

By the start of April, FEMA officials confirmed to the House Oversight and Reform Committee that demand for ventilators would soon outpace the available supply. To ration what was left, FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor directed that the remaining ventilators in the national stockpile be designated as a “strategic national asset” — to be provided to states only on a case-by-case basis where hospitals could demonstrate an “exigent need” to sustain life within 72 hours.

Federal purchasing records show that three months into the pandemic, HHS, which includes the Strategic National Stockpile, had not yet placed any orders for new ventilators in 2020.

That changed within three days of Trump’s March 27 edict, with HSS signing a $350 million deal with Zoll Medical Corp. Records show a flurry of about a dozen big orders with other ventilator makers over the next two weeks, most of them no-bid contracts exempted from the typical federal purchasing rules due to the national emergency.

In a typical year, U.S. companies produce about 29,000 ventilators, according to data cited by the White House. Though several domestic manufacturers had already announced they were adding extra shifts and hiring additional workers to ramp up production, AP’s analysis of HHS contracts show that even with the emergency no-bid orders the traditional medical device makers would deliver about 73,990 new ventilators by July 6 — the 100-day mark since Trump’s March 27 pledge.

It was clear additional industrial capacity would be needed to get 100,000 units by the president’s deadline.

General Motors, which had shut down auto production, had already entered into a partnership on March 20 with Ventec Life Systems, a small ventilator company, to simplify an off-the-shelf design for rapid production at GM’s Kokomo, Indiana, plant.

Though GM had announced it was “working night and day” to launch production, Trump accused CEO Mary Barra via Twitter of dragging her feet, and revived his long-running feud with the company over its 2019 closure of an Ohio factory that Trump had pledged to save.

“As usual with ‘this’ General Motors, things just never seem to work out,” Trump tweeted on March 27. “General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!”

GM had sold the Lordstown factory in 2019.

The president also took aim at Ford Motor Co., tweeting that the rival automaker should also “GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!”

On April 8, HHS announced it had reached a $489.4 million deal with GM to produce 30,000 ventilators by the end of August, with the first 6,132 delivered by June 1.

The following week, HHS announced a $336 million contract with Ford and General Electric, which teamed up to make 50,000 of GE Healthcare’s ventilators by July 13.

Assuming all the companies meet their deadlines, AP’s analysis shows the national stockpile should surpass 100,000 new ventilators by mid-July.

HHS declined to release to AP its contracts with ventilator producers without a Freedom of Information Act request, a legal process that can often take months or even years.

But AP’s analysis of the limited contract data available online and figures taken from HHS media releases shows the agency will spend more than $2.9 billion for 198,890 ventilators by the end of 2020, an average per-unit cost of $14,618.

Whether that’s a good deal for U.S. taxpayers is difficult to determine because medical device makers generally don’t publish their prices. HHS is buying at least 13 different models of ventilators from 10 different companies, all with different capabilities, features and accessories.

When AP sought details from HHS about the per-unit cost of four models from manufacturer Hamilton Medical, the agency’s press office provided figures that did not add up to the totals announced in earlier media releases. An HHS spokesperson said the previously provided figures were wrong and would be corrected on the agency’s website.

AP found several instances where the U.S. government had purchased the same models of ventilators before the pandemic. For example, contracting data does show that in December the Department of Defense bought a single, portable ventilator from Zoll Medical for $12,260.

Under its current contract with Zoll, HHS is purchasing 18,900 of the same model for slightly more than $350 million. That works out to about $18,500 each, which would be a more than 50 percent increase from what the Pentagon paid less than five months ago.

A HHS spokeswoman said Friday the government was paying about $12,100 for each ventilator, and that the additional money was for hoses, face masks and other related supplies needed to treat COVID-19 patients. The ventilators also came with a wheeled plastic case with power port, which cost an additional $722 each, according to HHS.

The Defense Department did not respond to questions Friday about whether its 2019 ventilator deliveries also included accessories.

Zoll’s top executive said his company’s pricing had remained consistent.

“Zoll is supplying the U.S. government with its requested products at our usual and customary government pricing, absorbing the additional costs associated with Zoll’s rapid increase in production capacity,” Zoll CEO Jonathan Rennert said Friday. “We are focused on fulfilling the government’s order on time and meeting this urgent public need.”

Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who studies the medical device industry, said ventilator companies are probably incurring increased costs as they ramp up production to meet high demand. Manufacturers haven’t had time to bulk buy additional parts and probably had to add workers to make more of the machines, he said.

U.S. ventilator makers have raised production from a rate of about 700 per week in February to about 5,000 per week by early April, according to the Advanced Medical Technology Association, an industry trade group.

“If you don’t have time to change your manufacturing processes to get those economies of scale, you get there by brute force, extra labor,” said Gordon, who teaches a course in monetizing medical device ideas. “Your costs actually go up, not down.”

With the federal government buying most of the new ventilators being made in the U.S., state governments and hospital systems urgently seeking the machines have often been forced to go through middlemen or foreign suppliers.

Cuomo has compared the free-for-all bidding to going on eBay, and said during a March 31 briefing that New York had ordered 17,000 ventilators from China for $25,000 each.

“We are paying $25,000 per ventilator, and we are broke,” Cuomo said. “The last thing I want to do is buy a single ventilator I don’t need.”

More than a month later, only 2,500 of the Chinese machines have been delivered, according to Cuomo’s office. In a separate case, New York officials are trying to recover another $69.1 million paid to a Silicon Valley electrical engineer who promised 1,450 ventilators that never materialized.

With nearly 200,000 new ventilators set for delivery to the federal stockpile by the end of the year, Trump is declaring victory. But it is now unclear whether the stockpile of new ventilators will be needed.

In the little more than a month since Trump announced the buying spree, a series of medical studies has spurred questions about whether ventilators are effective at saving the lives of critically ill COVID-19 patients.

A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 30 found that only 1 of 7 patients older than 70 who were put on a ventilator survived. For patients younger than 70, just 36% lived.

In New York City, state officials say 80% or more of coronavirus patients placed on the machines died.

The studies have caused doctors to reevaluate the use of ventilators in favor of less intensive forms of respiratory support.

Trump administration officials say the new ventilators could still prove valuable if the virus outbreak were to intensify into a second wave after the warm summer months.

“It’s very important that we have a completely refreshed and a comprehensive stockpile going into the fall,” Dr. Deborah Birx, a medical adviser on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said at a briefing on April 21. “I think that’s why we’ve continued to bring in those shipments and work on the ventilators so that those would be available not only for the United States but certainly if other partner countries have this level of tragedy.”

Trump said he intends to ship thousands of the breathing machines overseas, where the needs are greater.

On Tuesday, Mexico said it received a shipment of ventilators from the United States. Trump said last week Russia is also set to receive U.S. ventilators, along with other countries.

“People dying because they don’t have ventilators, and they’re not equipped to do what we did,” Trump said Friday. “So we’re giving thousands and thousands of these ventilators away to many countries that have suffered greatly: Italy, France, Spain, so many countries. And Nigeria called. Tremendous problems in Nigeria. Tremendous problems all over. And so they’re very happy.”

When the Trump administration outlined federal guidelines back in march for work considered essential during the COVID-19 pandemic, it included specific language for new and existing oil pipeline construction projects.

Within days Canadian-owned TC Energy Corporation announced it had secured more than a billion dollars to continue with construction of the 1,200 mile Keystone ML Pipeline.

The project, which was halted in 2015 by the Obama administration amid growing public outcry, was reissued permits in the early days of the Trump administration, with the stipulation that American steel be used in the work.

638,638,778,Quarantine Diaries: Derek Hough's neighbors wonder why he's outside in full Disney costume,"Going stir-crazy in quarantine? You’re not alone. Celebrities are cooped up in their homes across the country just like the rest of us. As we collectively navigate this uncharted territory, USA TODAY presents Quarantine Diaries, which give readers a peek into how our favorite stars are spending their time at home.

Today's diarist is ""Dancing With the Stars"" six-time champion Derek Hough, who romped to ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"" with girlfriend and fellow quarantiner Hayley Erbert on Sunday's ""The Disney Family Singalong 2."" (The couple re-created ""Be Our Guest"" for the first singalong last month.) Here's what life is like for multi-threat entertainer Hough, 34, who appears as a judge on NBC's ""World of Dance"" fourth season (returns May 26). – As told to Bryan Alexander

8 a.m. Sometimes we sleep in, but often we get up about 8 with our cat nuzzling our faces. The bed becomes this animal affair with two cats (Lily and Palo) and dog Romie jumps in at about 7. Most of the time, we don't have breakfast. I drink this green shake in the morning, my favorite thing, with super-green powder and vitamins. I mix it with mango-flavored Pre-Workout. It's healthy and gives a little boost.

Staying Apart, Together: Are you breathing correctly? Plus, the healing power of the Olympics

9:00 a.m. The thing I love doing right now that I've never really had time to do, but I obviously have a lot of time now, is gardening. It's springtime, so everything is blooming. I'm outside for a solid hour in the morning, picking weeds, watering the plants, admiring the new growth. There's something very peaceful and nurturing. It's amazing that gardening is my new favorite thing to do in the morning.

11 a.m. We try work out every day, do something physical. Especially right now. motion equals emotion. Whenever I'm not moving, my brain starts going a little busy. We do something outside or in the garage. I just need to move.

On creating televised routines from home: Choreographing with limited home space has definitely required creativity. But it focuses me. Normally you have a camera operator. But it's just Hayley and me. We have to fix the camera, perform, look at it. And it's like we moved out of frame or the angle's not good. Constant trial and error. Fortunately, we've been part of a lot of shows and tours. So a lot of the costumes didn't make it back to wardrobe, they make it back to our closets. Like those chimney sweep outfits or the Belle costume.

I did see my neighbor outside while I was in full Lumiere costume and I was like, ""Don't even ask me about it."" That was hilarious.

On dancing for stress relief: When I'm dancing professionally or to create something, I'm in that zone. When I'm just dancing for fun, it doesn't look good. I kind of dance like a fool, honestly, like that embarrassing uncle at a wedding. But the truth is, moving around freely with no rules is definitely liberating and makes you feel good.

6 p.m. We start making dinner. I don't know my way around the kitchen at all. I'm a sous chef to Hayley. I call it ""Hayl's Kitchen."" She directs, ""Wash this, watch this, peel this."" We like to watch shows like ""The World's Most Extraordinary Homes"" while we cook. I just love architecture. So there's often times we'll be cooking and I'll fall into a daze watching and she'll be like, ""Babe, we need those things."" And I'm like, ""Sorry, sorry."" But it's fun and nice to create something. I clean up afterward. That way, I feel I've done my part.

Dessert treat: We eat healthy all day. But after dinner is when the candy, popcorn, chips and salsa, and Twizzlers come out. Hayley has made her own ice cream, mint chocolate chip. I was like, ""I didn't know we had that machine."" She made something called S'mores Yumminess. It's graham-cracker crust with marshmallow fluff and chocolate, more graham cracker on top. She bakes it, and it's insane. She's surprising me with these skills.

On working through relationships: After six weeks of being with each other 24/7 is when we started to become like, ""OK, we might've reached our limit here."" But it's been really good, actually. If we don't agree on something or get into an argument, it's very short-lived. Because at this moment of time, we're just thankful for our health and for everything. We don't take that for granted. Also, when you're with somebody, it's not like, ""OK, I'm leaving, I'm going to go cool off out here."" It's like, ""OK, we've got to figure this out as fast as possible."" So it's been good.

What I'm streaming: We knocked out ""Tiger King"" pretty quickly. Fascinating and disturbing. We managed to get through ""Ozark,"" all three seasons. We're loving Netflix's ""Queer Eye,"" which is a great transformational show.

11 p.m. I head to bed at night like 11. This is after we'll watch something on the couch. She's out after like 30 seconds, mouth agape out cold. But I'll watch the movie or the show until about 11.

When quarantine ends: We're going to Yosemite or a national park that is just beautiful. Nature is just the ultimate. Right now with the cats, we're seeing straight up ""National Geographic."" When you watch them all day, you see behavior you've never seen before.

886,886,1059,"""My son is in danger"": Fear mounts over largest coronavirus outbreak in ICE detention","Immigration attorney Deron Smallcomb emailed several U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials on Wednesday, imploring them to brief him on the medical condition of his client, who was hospitalized. His first question was simple: ""Is my client alive?""

""I demand to speak with my client, today,"" Smallcomb continued. ""That is, assuming he is still alive.""

Smallcomb soon learned what he had suspected for days. In a brief call later that day, his client, 41-year-old Noe Perez, said he had contracted the coronavirus.

Perez, an immigrant from El Salvador, is one of at least 986 immigrants who have tested positive for COVID-19 while in ICE custody, according to the agency's latest tally. He is also among at least 149 ICE detainees who have contracted the disease while detained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center, a prison in the San Diego area that is home to the largest coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. immigration detention system.

At least 11 ICE employees assigned to the facility and 24 staffers with the for-profit prison company that runs it have also tested positive for the virus, according to the immigration agency and CoreCivic, the private corrections firm. Additionally, at least 68 U.S. Marshals Service detainees awaiting criminal trial or sentencing at the facility have tested positive, according to a Justice Department official.

The facility housed the first and only known immigrant to have died of coronavirus complications while in ICE custody.

Perez's family in California, a mix of U.S. citizens and green card holders, fears for his life. Before he contracted the virus, he was suffering from pulmonary embolism, thrombosis, ulcers and a hernia. He also has to take daily blood thinners for the rest of his life.

""I'm very worried about my son. My son is in danger,"" his mother, Laura, told CBS News in Spanish. ""We are all human beings. They are not animals. But they treat them like animals. They don't care about these boys.""

Laura, the rest of the family and Smallcomb feel like they have been stonewalled by ICE as Perez's health has deteriorated. They said the agency did not inform them of Perez's hospitalization until they spent days demanding answers. In one of his numerous emails to ICE officials in the San Diego area, Smallcomb said he and the family only found out about Perez's hospitalization through an anonymous source.

Asked about the family's concerns, an ICE spokesperson said the agency could not comment on Perez's medical condition, citing state and federal privacy laws. The spokesperson said requests to call hospitalized detainees have to be reviewed and approved by an ICE official.

Though relieved that he was able to speak to Perez on Wednesday, Smallcomb said there's no sign ICE will release his client. On Tuesday, the parole request he submitted on behalf of Perez was denied. In its decision notice, which was reviewed by CBS News, ICE said Perez's ""discretionary release"" would not ""conform to this agency's priority.""

An ICE spokesperson did not elaborate on why the agency denied the parole request. Notices typically state whether the agency believes a detainee could be a flight risk or a threat to public safety if released.

Smallcomb believes ICE is not releasing his medically vulnerable client because of a conviction for assault with a semi-automatic firearm in 1998. But he said his client has already paid his debt to society by serving a 22-year prison sentence. Perez was convicted as a teenager, according to California court records.

ICE confirmed it arrested Perez in January after he finished his prison sentence and is seeking to deport him to El Salvador, which he fled with his family in 1986 because of the civil war there.

Like Perez's family, Smallcomb fears for his client's life, saying he should be working to prevent Perez's deportation — not his death.

""A 41-year-old male with serious underlying conditions and daily medications to stay alive, that's the first guy you test, that's the first guy you quarantine, that's the first guy you release,"" Smallcomb told CBS News.

During his phone call with Perez on Wednesday, Smallcomb said he learned his client has been transferred to two San Diego-area hospitals since last Friday, after days of complaining of pain in his chest and lower back, excessive sweating and trouble breathing. Perez had been tested for coronavirus earlier last week and received the positive result the day he was hospitalized, Smallcomb said.

Since then, Perez has been diagnosed with pneumonia and two ""black clouds"" on his lungs, Smallcomb said, recounting the conversation with his client. Perez has begun an antibiotic regimen and remains in serious pain, his lawyer added.

Laura has been distraught since her son's health deteriorated. Not being able to talk to him on Mother's Day was particularly difficult. She faults ICE for his current condition, saying he felt ill for days before being taken to a hospital. ""If they had acted on time, my son would not be in the hospital.""

""What is ICE doing? Letting people die?"" she asked.

Laura has found some solace in talking to another immigrant family in California who recently faced a similar situation.

""My heart still hurts""

Rosa is still hurting from her brother's death. ""My heart still hurts. I can't sleep at night because I'm desperate,"" she told CBS News. ""I want to turn back time.""

She called Laura after the advocacy group Pueblos Sin Fronteras told her about Perez's situation. ""She's also devastated,"" Rosa said, referring to Laura.

Rosa, a Los Angeles resident who is also from El Salvador, lost her brother last week. Carlos Ernesto Escobar Mejía died of coronavirus complications at a San Diego-area hospital after being transferred there in late April from the Otay Mesa detention center, where he had been held by ICE since January.

Like Perez, Escobar Mejía fled El Salvador as a child during the 1980s. They both had run-ins with the law that made them targets for deportation. Escobar Mejía also had preexisting medical conditions and U.S. citizen family members clamoring for his release.

Rosa said she does not want other immigrants detained at the Otay Mesa facility to meet her brother's fate.

""My heart still aches. I don't want that to happen to other families. Please free them,"" she said, in a plea to the U.S. government.

According to an ICE spokeswoman, ICE has released more than 900 detainees it determined were at increased risk of severe illness if infected with the coronavirus because of their age or medical conditions. The agency has also been required to free more than 190 detainees under court orders stemming from lawsuits filed by advocates across the country.

Because of an order by a federal judge in San Diego, ICE has released 70 of the roughly 130 Otay Mesa detainees it identified as medically vulnerable, according to court filings. Last week, the same judge denied a separate request to order the release of at-risk U.S. Marshals detainees.

Bardis Vakili, an attorney with the San Diego branch of the American Civil Liberties Union working on both cases, said some immigrant detainees in the vulnerable categories are still waiting for medical clearance to be released. But he said the agency has indicated it does not intend to release about 35 medically at-risk detainees because of their criminal records.

Vakili said ICE needs to continue reducing the number of immigrants detained at the Otay Mesa facility, which stopped taking new detainees in April. ICE said it continues to hold roughly 544 detainees at the San Diego-area detention center.

""The main concern here is that these are buildings where everyone is in a congregate environment. They share bathrooms, showers, sleeping cells,"" Vakili told CBS News. ""They are packed tightly together.""

As coronavirus cases among detained immigrants have continued to grow consistently, advocates have urged ICE to further downsize its nationwide detainee population, which stood at nearly 28,000 last week, saying the agency is still detaining immigrants with medical conditions and others who don't pose a threat to the public.

In a letter Thursday, the House Oversight Committee accused ICE of not taking the crisis ""seriously,"" urging the agency to release all asylum-seekers and ""non-violent people"" in its custody.

In a court filing last week, the agency said it had identified more than 4,400 detainees considered to be at increased risk of severe illness or death if contracting the coronavirus under guidelines set by a federal judge in California. The agency also continues to detain more than 4,800 asylum-seekers who have demonstrated credible fear of being persecuted or tortured in their home countries.

Elsy, who requested that her last name not be published so she could speak freely, is one of many asylum-seekers held by ICE at Otay Mesa. She said she fled El Salvador last year after been threatened and marginalized because of her identity as a lesbian woman. She was required to wait in Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols program. She was only allowed into the U.S. after proving to an asylum officer that she had been persecuted while waiting in Mexico.

After the group representing her, the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, helped Elsy find a sponsor in the U.S., ICE granted her parole, but it conditioned her release on her paying a $15,000 bond. Because advocates have been unable to raise the funds, Elsy has been detained at Otay Mesa for roughly eight months. She said she has grown increasingly frustrated during the pandemic, feeling powerless to protect herself from the coronavirus inside a facility plagued by the contagion.

""I came fleeing to prevent something from happening to me in my home country,"" Elsy told CBS News. ""Now, I'm here in the U.S. in a detention center, but it's still very difficult because I don't know if I will come out of here alive or dead.""",1
852,852,1021,"48,000 Yemeni women could die giving birth as UN starts shutting down maternity services due to funding gap","London — The United Nations agency that runs maternity wards and maternal health services across war-torn Yemen says the program is nearly out of money. The agency notified authorities this week that it will no longer be able to support 140 of its 180 facilities in the country.

It's a new, imminent threat to medical care for women in a country ravaged by years of war and disease. The U.N. says tens of thousands of expectant mothers will be at risk of dying during childbirth if funding isn't secured.

UNFPA, the U.N.'s sexual and reproductive health agency, provides basic reproductive healthcare to hundreds of thousands of Yemeni women. The agency says that without its services, 320,000 pregnant women will be cut off from care and 48,000 could die from complications during delivery. The situation is only expected to worsen with the spread of the coronavirus.

""By cutting support to UNFPA, you've basically cut the umbilical cord of the reproductive health system in the country,"" Nestor Owomuhangi, representative for UNFPA in Yemen, told CBS News.

""It's grave,"" he said. ""It was bad before corona. We have weekly meetings, and… you can see an aura of hopelessness, given the corona that's knocking on our doors.""

World's worst humanitarian crisis

Before the coronavirus pandemic, aid groups were already calling the situation in Yemen the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Years of brutal conflict between the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and the Saudi Arabia-backed government have decimated the country's infrastructure and led to widespread famine and disease.

""And then you have a situation where you have the coronavirus that has devastated the world, and for Yemen, we are looking at a population that has been resilient in a sense, but has gone through all kinds of catastrophes - of cholera and malnutrition - and therefore their immunity levels are low,"" Owomuhangi said.

People in Yemen already have very limited access to healthcare, with only about half of the health facilities functioning across the country. Of those, only 20% offer maternal and child health services - many of which are supported by UNFPA. If it is unable to raise more funds by July, it will be forced to close up to 90% of its services in Yemen.

""They have no health system, and there is no political organization to support them. So how hopeful are we? We only know that the hopes of the population are on us,"" Owomuhangi said.

Women's health and COVID-19

UNFPA operates a wide range of sexual and reproductive services in many countries, but in Yemen it focuses primarily on life-saving interventions during childbirth.

""It's already the minimum service,"" Arthur Erken, UNFPA's director of strategic partnerships and communications, told CBS News. ""These health facilities that lack staff, that lack supplies, that have been bombed or been severely damaged by the war, are already in a difficult state - these 140 need to stay open. Otherwise the consequences will be directly – the health and death will be directly a result of closing (them). Of course, if you have no money, that's pretty much end-of-story,"" he said.

Even before the coronavirus started spreading across the world, the agency didn't have enough funding to make it to the end of this year. When a donor conference was cancelled in April because of the pandemic, it left them in dire straits. UNFPA says it now needs $59 million to continue operations in Yemen until the end of 2020, plus another $24 million to deal with the extra burden of COVID-19 in the country.

""Women are pregnant. They were pregnant before the crisis. They're pregnant now. How do you deal with that?"" said Erken. He said the crisis can only be addressed by the international community collectively, and he urged nations to step up through the U.N., ""to make sure that being pregnant is not a death sentence in the coronavirus crisis.""

Only a few dozen cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Yemen, but on Friday, the international healthcare nonprofit Doctors Without Borders said that, because testing capacity in the country is ""extremely limited, it is impossible to know the full extent of the spread of the virus."" The charity Save the Children said it has seen a surge in deaths of people with coronavirus symptoms in the southern city of Aden - approximately 50 people a day over the last week.

""Our hope is in the hope of the people who believe that we can make a difference,"" Owomuhangi said. ""And for that reason we have no choice but to believe that we can be able to provide support, whatever we can, not to let the population down.""",1
810,810,979,Top biotech analysts interviewed infectious disease and public health experts about reopening the US. Here are the 5 things they're most worried about.,"Analysts at SVB Leerink interviewed three experts in infectious disease immunology, epidemiology, and public health about ""back to normal"" strategies in the US.

The conversation reveals how many questions remain unanswered about the novel coronavirus.

The experts were particularly worried about regional testing disparities and eased lockdowns.

They said we still have a lot to learn, like how to do contact tracing at scale.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Last week, analysts at SVB Leerink interviewed three experts in infectious disease immunology, epidemiology, and public health about ""back to normal"" strategies in the US.

The conversation reveals how many questions remain unanswered about the novel coronavirus and how it can be stopped — from basic, disease-specific concerns like symptoms and transmission, to testing complications and herd immunity, according to a summary the analysts, led by Geoffrey Porges, sent investors.

In the US, COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has killed nearly 80,000 people and is leading to strange complications in children that scientists still don't understand. Meanwhile, even in the fourth month of US outbreaks, confusion persists about how new testing methodologies and treatments will be deployed.

The experts, who were not identified by SVB Leerink, were particularly worried about rural and urban disparities in testing the effects as stay-at-home orders are lifted, according to the summary.

One expert is ""deeply worried"" that the US will return back to where it started, as the positive test rate is still high in several areas that plan to loosen restrictions, according to the summary.

The experts ""are concerned that once the social distance measures are relaxed there will be a surging number of infected cases,"" the Leerink analysts wrote.

New York is looking to partially reopen starting May 15, based on a set of criteria used to evaluate outbreaks at the local level. Similarly, California released reopening guidelines last week for counties and businesses.

Meanwhile, testing and tracing capabilities as a whole ""still seem shorthanded,"" particularly in rural areas, according to the experts. As reported by The Atlantic last week, the US needs to double or triple its daily testing, but the federal government has no plans to support that increase.

The experts also believe further research is required to address a number of questions about COVID-19's manifestation, duration of immunity, and the role of children in its transmission.

Here are 5 key takeaways from the report.

The role of children in transmission is still unknown

It's still not clear whether children play a major role in coronavirus transmission, according to the experts. For other respiratory diseases like the flu, children are known to be ""major drivers for community transmission,"" the report said.

But in those cases, children tend to develop severe symptoms compared to their adult counterparts, which isn't true for COVID-19. Meanwhile, such a small group of symptomatic coronavirus cases in children makes them difficult to study, the experts told SVB Leerink.

Contact tracing is a method by which public health officials work with a sick patient to find everyone they've come into contact with. One expert told Leerink that the logic is straightforward, but the logistics are not.

For 100 coronavirus cases per day, for example, and 10-15 contacts for each case, up to 300 tracing workers with 40-hour work weeks are needed, according to the summary. States like New York, Maryland, and Massachusetts are all planning to hire or hiring contact tracers, they said.

Still a long way to national testing

Testing underpins all other health and economic measures meant to combat the virus, the experts told SVB Leerink. Today, it's not coordinated at a national level, leading to ""significant variability"" among different geographic regions, according to the report.

Until testing infrastructure is ""formalized,"" country-wide reopening will be problematic, they said.

Current coronavirus tests aren't always accurate

The US Food and Drug Administration has taken steps to get faulty antibody tests off the market, but their accuracy is still wide-ranging. One expert pointed out that tests relying on pinpricks tend to perform worse than those relying on blood draws analyzed in laboratories.

Mitigation efforts alone will not end the pandemic

While social distancing helps, and more people could potentially gain immunity, the only thing that will truly stop the virus in its tracks is a vaccine, according to the experts.

""We will ultimately need vaccination (or a large number of infection cases) in combination with social distancing to contain spread and allow some return to our usual activities,"" the summary said.",1
1078,1078,1284,3 reasons coronavirus testing is not a magic wand for businesses looking to reopen safely,"Dr. Joshua Sharfstein and Dr. Lisa Maragakis

Opinion contributors

As the pressure to reopen the economy intensifies, business leaders are searching for ways to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection for their workers and customers. An alluring idea is to offer testing on site, keeping those who are positive out of the workplace.

Testing seems to offer a combination of confidence building for employees and liability protection for companies. Some employers are even pursuing mandatory testing, which is permitted by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

So, should universal testing in the workplace become part of the new normal?

Not yet. Given technical and resource limitations, testing is no more than one piece of the puzzle of infection prevention and control. There are three major reasons why it would be a mistake for employers to rely heavily or exclusively on testing for safety:

Social distancing vital even with tests

►Sufficient testing is difficult to put in place at even moderate scale. Testing for active SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on identifying the genetic material of the virus in a sample taken from the back of the throat or the nose. (Saliva testing also is promising.) For one person at a time, with certain machines, results are possible within as little as 15 minutes. When dozens or hundreds of samples are needed, however, samples need to be run in tandem on larger machines, and the results are likely to take hours.

If you ask people to wait a day for the results, that’s another day when latent infection could manifest itself, and another test would be needed. And so on. New rapid “antigen” tests are unlikely to solve this problem, given weaknesses with their accuracy.

Pooling saliva samples from the whole workplace is a potential way to search for the coronavirus at lower cost. This strategy, however, takes additional time for sample collection and laboratory work. It also requires follow-up testing should the pooled sample prove positive.

►Negative test results do not eliminate the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the workplace. The accuracy of the test depends on when it is performed in an individual’s course of infection. Many asymptomatic people with SARS-CoV-2 infection could test negative — especially if they are in the pre-symptomatic but infectious phase. As a result, even the world’s most robust testing program would not eliminate the need for social distancing within an office or retail setting. One missed infection in someone who attends a packed staff meeting will require the whole office to quarantine.

COVID protection: Workplaces aren't ready for mass reopening. First we need standards to keep workers safe.

►Employer testing at scale could lead to shortages of testing supplies and compromise the ability of health care facilities to test people who develop symptoms. Consultants offering testing to businesses may go straight to suppliers of swabs, reagents and testing machines and outbid public health agencies and clinics. If even a fraction of workplaces attempts regular testing, the demands could far exceed capacity.

Less testing of those at greatest risk of infection will mean fewer opportunities for isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, the core components of controlling community spread. As cases in a community rise, so too will the likelihood of infections penetrating every workplace.

Sick leave, screenings and ventilation

Rather than as a magic wand, employers should look at testing as a potential piece of a comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy.

Employers should provide generous sick leave and quarantine benefits, screen employees and customers for symptoms before they come to the workplace, and reengineer the work environment to maintain at least 6 feet of distance and high levels of ventilation. They should focus on ways to promote hand hygiene, social distancing, environmental disinfection, and rapid identification and contact tracing for employees who develop COVID-19.

False choice:Protesters should demand coronavirus safety and a reopened economy. We can have both.

Regular testing is most appropriate for small cohorts of people who are unable to socially distance at work and who are exposed to the public in close quarters. Indeed, such testing could prove to be of high utility in very high-risk settings, such as nursing homes. Broad testing is also important in the setting of an outbreak, as directed by public health agencies.

Testing alone, however, is insufficient as an infection prevention and control strategy. A test might find the novel coronavirus, but only careful planning, policy changes, reengineering the workplace and social distancing can stop it from spreading. There are no shortcuts to defeating COVID-19.

526,526,647,The IRS Sent Coronavirus Relief Payments To Dead People,"The IRS Sent Coronavirus Relief Payments To Dead People

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Updated at 10:06 p.m. ET

The IRS has paid out more than $207 billion in coronavirus relief payments to individual taxpayers, as part of the $2 trillion package passed by Congress known as the CARES Act.

And among the recipients of those $1,200 payments are the bank accounts of dead individuals — a problem that could impact millions of American families.

Bob L'Hommedieu's father passed away in December after a long battle with dementia. So L'Hommedieu notified the Veterans Administration and the Social Security Administration that his father had passed, and payments from those agencies were halted. But on April 15, he noticed a payment in the amount of $1,200 in his late father's account.

It was a coronavirus relief payment from the IRS.

""I feel bad that this money is sitting in my dad's account,"" says L'Hommedieu, who lives in Houston. ""I don't know what to do with it. And there are people out there that need it badly.""

""And, you know, that bothers me. Quite a bit. I wish I knew what to do with it, but, you know, I don't,"" he added.

L'Hommedieu reached out to his two senators in Texas. One sent a form letter that didn't answer his questions. The other told him to contact the IRS. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told The Wall Street Journal one week ago that heirs should return the money sent to deceased individuals. But people who talked to NPR said they had more questions than answers.

""There's mass confusion,"" said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. ""There's been no official guidance as to how, in this instance, people should return the money that was received for their loved ones.""

The IRS did not answer questions about the payments, but the scope of the problem has the potential to be vast. The CDC estimates that 2.8 million Americans died in 2018, for example. And there are signs that people who died more than two years ago have received payments.

Karen McClure, of Fort Collins, Colo., says her mother passed away in January 2018. But in April of this year, her late mother's bank account received a payment of $1,200.

McClure said she reached out to her local congressman but hasn't heard back.

""The government is being very reactive instead of proactive to this situation — which I find frustrating,"" she says.

Mark Everson, who served as IRS commissioner from 2003 to 2007, says that the IRS has generally been doing a good job, ""but there's a real trade-off of speed versus accuracy in the processing,"" he says. ""There's a lot of pressure to move quickly, and in the past Treasury and the IRS have been criticized because they haven't moved quickly enough.""

Everson says that people in this situation should rely on official guidance from IRS.gov.

Teresa Wilmot, 71, has been trying to do just that. The Rockford, Ill., resident lost her partner of 39 years, Frank Dajka, just two months ago. Last month, she noticed a payment in his account.

""I'm coping with [the] Frank stuff pretty well at this point. I'm not over it. I probably will never be over it,"" she says. ""But that part didn't bother me. I'm probably angrier at the government for sending out a payment to somebody who's deceased.""

Wilmot has been trying without success to find guidance online from the IRS to send the money back.

""I went online to the address on the letter and looked for a long time trying to find some way that I could first send the payment back. And I couldn't find that,"" she says. ""So I look for a way to contact somebody at the IRS or the Treasury or whatever to return the payment. And I couldn't find that.""

After multiple requests, the IRS declined to answer questions and directed them to the Treasury Department.

Wednesday morning, after this story first published, the Treasury Department told NPR that payments made to people who died before the payment was received should be returned to the IRS, and it published instructions on its website.

1372,1379,1902,"FIRST coronavirus death confirmed in Gaza, as Palestinian territories lift lockdown","The death of a 77-year-old woman in the Gaza Strip marks the enclave’s first coronavirus fatality, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported. The illness has so far claimed three lives across the Palestinian territories.

The victim, who had been suffering from a prior illness, recently entered Gaza from Egypt and was quarantined on arrival. The Palestinian Health Ministry announced her death on Saturday.

The woman is the first coronavirus patient to die in the 41km-long patch of territory, whose 1.8 million residents are walled off from Israel to the north and east, and from Egypt to the south. Three deaths have now been recorded by the authorities in Gaza and the West Bank, and another two in Jerusalem, which is claimed by the Palestinians as their capital.

Also on rt.com How on earth is Palestine supposed to cope with Covid-19 – and where is the international outcry?

The Palestinian territories have fared relatively well throughout the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 423 cases have been recorded by the health ministry – just 83 per million people. By contrast, neighboring Israel has seen nearly 280 deaths and 17,000 cases, or 1,900 per million.

However, the low number of infections likely reflects the limited testing capacity in the territories. Ventilators are a scarce commodity, and, even before the pandemic, the Israeli blockade of Gaza was highlighted by the World Health Organization as hindering Palestinians’ access to quality healthcare. Across the Palestinian territories as a whole, fewer than 80 intensive-care unit (ICU) beds are available to treat the sickest patients.

Still, with case numbers low and no patients needing these ICU beds at present, the Palestinian authorities eased the lockdown measures in the West Bank on Monday, reopening stores and permitting local travel. Nonetheless, a wholesale ban on movement between cities and towns was not lifted in time for Saturday’s feast of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

796,796,965,"One in 4 people who died of COVID-19 in English hospitals had diabetes, NHS data finds","The National Health Service found that type 1 and type 2 diabetes was a leading underlying condition in those who died of COVID-19 in England, according to findings published Thursday by the organization.

More than one in four people who died with COVID-19 also had diabetes, according to the report.

After diabetes, the most common comorbidities include ""dementia (18%), serious breathing problems (15%), chronic kidney disease (14%),"" and ischaemic heart disease (10%),"" The Guardian reported.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

One in four people in England who died with COVID-19 also had diabetes, according to data from the National Health Service.

The NHS report published Thursday broke down the underlying conditions of the 22,332 individuals who died of the coronavirus in hospitals in England between March 31 and May 12, and type 1 and type 2 diabetes was the leading comorbidity with 5,873 people, amounting to 26%, The Guardian reported.

The report did not differentiate how many fatalities occurred in those who also had type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

After diabetes, other common underlying conditions include ""dementia (18%), serious breathing problems (15%) and chronic kidney disease (14%). One in ten (10%) suffered from ischaemic heart disease,"" according to The Guardian report.

""It is clear that people with diabetes are more at risk of dying from COVID-19,"" Partha Kar, a NHS consultant in diabetes and endocrinology, told The Guardian, adding that more details will be published in a follow-up article in a medical journal. It was not immediately clear what medical journal it will be published.

""More detailed analysis is currently underway to understand the link between the two, although initial findings indicate that the threat in people under 40 continues to be very low,"" Kar continued.

Bridget Turner, director of policy and care improvement at the charity, Diabetes UK, said the statistic released by the NHS highlights the need to better protect those who are ""clinically vulnerable"" to the virus.

""The fact that more than a quarter of people who have died with COVID-19 have diabetes underlines the urgent need to ensure better protection and extra support is available to those in the clinically vulnerable groups,"" Turner told The Guardian.",1
750,750,919,US Postal Service delays next-generation mail truck program due to pandemic,"The United States Postal Service (USPS) is pushing back the deadline for official bids to make its next-generation mail truck because of “the current COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on Postal Service and supplier operations.” The delay, which was first reported by Trucks.com, comes as the Postal Service is seeking billions of dollars in emergency funding as part of the Trump administration’s Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.

The deadline for bids was supposed to be March 27th, but is now July 14th, according to the USPS. The program could award up to $6 billion in contracts to one or multiple bidders, and it’s expected to result in the manufacturing of nearly 200,000 new mail trucks. Some of the bidders have been working on all-electric versions, others have explored hybrid options, and one — a joint effort from Ford and military vehicle manufacturer Oshkosh — is working on a gas-powered version.

The program to replace the USPS’s current trucks was launched in 2015. But it has dragged on, forcing the Postal Service to keep its current trucks in service past their expected life span — despite the fact that they were introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and lack features like air conditioning. Two of the original six companies have dropped out.

The current trucks are past their expiration date

One of the four remaining companies is Workhorse, a struggling electric vehicle startup that has many of its eggs in the USPS contract basket. Founded in 1998 as a commercial van manufacturer, it was bought by trucking giant Navistar in 2005, which eventually shut it down. AMP Electric Vehicles, a company focused on retrofitting combustion engine cars with EV powertrains, bought the IP in 2013 and assumed the Workhorse name.

The new Workhorse developed electric (and electric-assisted) commercial trucks and vans, some of which were bought by the likes of Ryder and UPS. The company also expanded into drones and started working on an electric pickup truck. But as sales of the trucks and vans dried up, Workhorse has taken on big loans from multiple investment firms to stay alive. It sold off its drone division, and sold the EV pickup truck IP to its former CEO, whose new startup Lordstown Motors bought an old General Motors plant. Workhorse, which received more than $1 million as part of the coronavirus Paycheck Protection Program, even recently bought out its partner in the mail truck program (trucking manufacturer VT Hackney) in order to keep its bid alive.

The other remaining competitors include the North American arm of Indian conglomerate Mahindra, which is working on both a combustion engine and a hybrid mail truck. Karsan, a Turkish commercial vehicle manufacturer, is working with Michigan-based USPS supplier Morgan Olson on a plug-in hybrid mail truck.

Amazon, which relies on the USPS but has been steadily building a proprietary delivery infrastructure for years, is undergoing its own major push to electrify its fleet. The company has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from EV startup Rivian as part of a big investment announced last year.",1

739,739,899,‘Frozen’ musical on Broadway won’t reopen when theaters get back on track,"NEW YORK — The big budget musical “Frozen” will not reopen when Broadway theaters restart, marking the first time an established show has been felled by the coronavirus pandemic.

The Disney show opened in March 2018 and placed among the top five Broadway productions for both gross and attendance over both years it ran, often pulling in over $1 million, and even $2 million a week.

Until now, only shows that were waiting to officially open have announced postponements or cancellations. Disney still has “The Lion King” and “Aladdin” on Broadway and five productions of “Frozen” worldwide.

Actors’ Equity Association, which represents 51,000 actors and stage managers, reacted with dismay to the news and urged New York and national politicians to rescue the arts sector.

“Today’s news should be an all hands-on-deck moment for Gov. (Mario) Cuomo, Mayor (Bill) De Blasio and Congress,” said Mary McColl, executive director. “The arts and entertainment sector drives the economy of New York, just like it does in cities and towns across the country. Decisions made in the days and weeks ahead will shape the future of the arts sector for years to come. Public officials at all levels must think much more boldly about supporting the arts or our entire economy will be slower to recover.”

Disney Theatrical gets no corporate subsidy from the Walt Disney Company and its stage shows must be financially self-sustaining.

Although an exact date for performances to resume on Broadway has yet to be determined, Broadway producers are now offering refunds and exchanges for tickets purchased for shows through Sept. 6.

Broadway performances were suspended on March 12 after Cuomo imposed a ban on gatherings of 500 or more people. There were 31 productions running, including eight new shows in previews and another eight shows in rehearsals preparing for the spring season.

Some shows like an upcoming revival of Neil Simon’s “Plaza Suite” starring Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker, as well as a musical about Michael Jackson, have pushed their production to next year.

Other shows scheduled to open this spring have abandoned their plans, including “Hangmen” and a revival of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”",1
1070,1070,1274,"Coronavirus: Pro sports could return in California by June, Gov. Gavin Newsom says","Play ball? Maybe so.

Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday the state is eyeing the first week of June for live pro sports events to be held. Two conditions: the current “trend lines” in the Covid-19 recovery must continue, and games will be played without spectators in attendance.

These plans were echoed by governors in New York and Texas.

“If our professional sports teams can make it work (& be safe) on their end, we’re supportive,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote on Twitter.

California could continue to implement a local approach to sports, as it has done in reopening other sectors. Newsom said the state was working with county health directors, state officials and representatives from all major sports leagues, as well as consulting with California’s pact of western-state governors.

“We’re just talking about the opportunity … to begin the process of organizing around what that may or may not look like,” Newsom said.

The three pro sports teams in Santa Clara County — the 49ers, the San Jose Sharks, and the San Jose Earthquakes — remain in limbo. The county with the strictest guideline in the state is expected to shelter-in-place for at least another two weeks.

The Bay Area’s major league baseball teams — the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics — would open their seasons around July 4 under a proposal that first must gain approval from the players’ union. Spring training, which was suspended about a week before Opening Day, would resume in mid-June, likely in Arizona.

Of course, nothing is certain.

“We’re holding off (comment) until we have a little more info on what this means for baseball,” a San Francisco Giants spokesperson said of Newsom’s green light for pro sports.

While the NBA has been exploring ways to complete its season — it came to an immediate halt March 11 when a Utah Jazz player tested positive for COVID-19 — several teams have begun conducting limited workouts at their facilities. The Warriors have not yet done that; they have 17 games remaining in a lost season, According to multiple reports, the league is considering resuming the season in a single site — such as Orlando, Florida or Las Vegas — to limit travel.

The 49ers hope to hold training camp at their Santa Clara facility in two months, a notion that suddenly isn’t nearly the longshot it was a week ago. Richard Sherman, the 49ers’ outspoken and Stanford-educated cornerback, took to Twitter to explain the state’s change in stance.

“Money changes everything,” Sherman wrote. “Teams started exploring options outside the state and all of a sudden the timeline changed.”

Money changes everything. Teams started exploring options outside the state and all of a sudden the timeline changed https://t.co/eeAIl8B4bg — Richard Sherman (@RSherman_25) May 18, 2020

The 49ers closed their stadium offices and training center in mid-March. The NFL is allowing clubs to reopen their facilities as early as Tuesday for up to 75 employees, while still prohibiting coaches and non-rehabilitating players. State and local governments must permit such openings and teams must meet the NFL’s revised health protocols.

The Sharks’ season remains on hold with the rest of the NHL. A restart would not necessarily assure the last-place Sharks (29-36-5) of playing out their remaining 12 games, including five at home, or joining any reconfigured playoff format.

“Any longer term return-to-play scenarios in our local facilities, whether for this season or next, will be based on the direction and guidance of local health officials,” said Scott Emmert, Sharks vice president of communications.

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, in a virtual town hall hosted last week by the Sharks, dismissed any notion the league will not be able to resume its season and award the Stanley Cup in the coming months. “States are re-opening, cities are re-opening,” Bettman said. “And if we do the right things, I think we’ll be able to finish the season.”",1
769,769,938,'Clean energy' job losses in the U.S. continue to climb as the coronavirus hits the sector hard,"The U.S. ""clean energy"" sector was hit by 447,208 new unemployment filings last month, according to new analysis of Department of Labor data.

Published on Wednesday, the analysis — released by Environmental Entrepreneurs, the American Council on Renewable Energy, E4TheFuture, and BW Research Partnership — paints a stark picture for the industry and reflects the significant impact that the coronavirus pandemic is having on the overall U.S. economy.

Clean energy job losses in April were far greater than March, when 147,139 claims were made. Total claims for March and April amount to 594,347, or 17.8% of the sector's workforce.

For the purposes of the analysis, the term ""clean energy"" encompasses a range of areas: energy efficiency; renewables; grid and storage; and ""clean"" vehicles and fuels.

Overall, April saw a little over 310,000 people working in energy efficiency file for unemployment, while there were 71,835 job losses in renewables. California was the worst hit state, losing 77,860 clean energy jobs last month.

Looking ahead, the report forecasts more job losses unless the U.S. administration and Congress ""take quick and substantive action to support the clean energy industry and its workers.""

If no action is taken, it's projected that 850,000 people in the sector will have filed for unemployment by June 30.

""The economic data from April shows that the job losses from the COVID-19 pandemic are worse than expected,"" Phil Jordan, vice president and principal at BW Research Partnership, said in a statement.



""Unemployment claims increased dramatically across many key segments of the clean energy sector, such as construction and manufacturing,"" Jordan added. ""And the data does not suggest that we have yet to hit the bottom.""

Around the world, firms working in sectors such as renewable energy are having to adapt to the new challenges posed by Covid-19.

Last week, Nordex became the latest wind turbine manufacturer to withdraw guidance for the 2020 financial year.

In April, Danish business Vestas suspended guidance for 2020, with the Aarhus-headquartered firm noting that the global spread of Covid-19 and national measures taken to contain it had caused disruptions to installations, manufacturing and its supply chain.",1
728,728,888,The American obsession with individualism and the refusal to wear a mask.,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Getty Images Plus.

It is strange, about the masks.

That it’s masks that have become charged objects, signifying the difference between Americans who want to protect themselves and others from COVID-19 and those who refuse to believe in COVID-19, is no longer in doubt. As Ryan Lizza and Daniel Lippman wrote in early May, as the pandemic has progressed, the American left has largely been willing to sacrifice personal liberties in exchange for containing the virus. And while most on the political right have agreed to take precautions like staying home, a “vocal activist wing of conservatism that has enormous influence on social media and Fox News, has been far more willing to attack the various infringements on where people can go and what they have to wear.” As a result, Lizza and Lippman conclude, “the mask has become the ultimate symbol of this new cultural and political divide.”

Nowhere has the split been more pronounced than within the White House itself, where the Trump administration’s own guidelines ask Americans to wear masks in public spaces to slow the spread and yet the president himself does not. After a White House valet tested positive for COVID-19 last week, President Donald Trump announced that the valets who serve food and work around him are now required to wear masks, although he and Vice President Mike Pence continue to refuse to do so. As Ron Elving notes, political leaders often do symbolic things to model behavior they want emulated, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been adamant that modeling such public safety measures is essential. (She matches her masks to her pantsuits.) But for Trump and those around him, refusing to don face coverings—even during visits with vulnerable populations like 95-year-old World War II veterans—seems to signal, well, something. But what?

Frank Bruni argues that the message from the White House is that “masks are emblems, maybe the best ones, of the Trump administration’s disregard for, and degradation of, experts and expertise.” Lippman and Lizza wonder whether the rejection of masks says something like “I don’t have to wear a mask because I have access to regular testing,” adding that “in that sense, being in close proximity to people without covering your face is a kind of new status symbol for the pandemic era.” Liz Plank argues that Trump would rather endanger himself and others. Anna North makes a parallel argument: “Such militaristic, tough-guy messaging, along with Trump’s refusal to wear a mask, may encourage ordinary people—especially men—to minimize the risk of coronavirus for the sake of appearing manly.” North further points out that American racial bias also plays a fundamental role in the refusal to cover one’s face: Whereas young black men are perceived as doubly dangerous when they are masked, some white men like to perform their own immunity from criminal consequences by refusing to cover up.

And that is the point. Trump and Pence’s public defiance of the guidance that suggests covering one’s face is best for your own safety and the safety of others is itself contagious. When Trump visited Phoenix recently, some of his fans harassed and insulted local journalists who were wearing masks, insisting that the reporters were “only wearing masks to instill fear,” BrieAnna Frank, with the Arizona Republic, later said. She posted a viral Twitter thread of journalists derided for being “on the wrong side of patriotism” and “like communists.” One man said of assembled male journalists in masks, “It’s submission, it’s muzzling yourself, it looks weak—especially for men.” Around the country, we’ve seen retail workers and restaurant employees violently assaulted for asking customers to cover up. The guiding theory seems to be that since only the weak will die, the burden shifts to them alone to protect themselves.

There is no question that there are race, gender, and power distortions that lead some Americans to see face covering as a sign of vulnerability, weakness, or surrender. But it strikes me that there is another layer—even above and beyond a denial of facts and science—that must be at play: There is an obsession with being seen and recognized that feels quintessentially American, even in situations of life and death.

There is an obsession with being seen and recognized that feels quintessentially American, even in situations of life and death.

It can’t be mere coincidence that some of the loudest objectors to masking try to advance First Amendment arguments about their right to express who they are. Paradoxically perhaps, state laws that ban the wearing of masks have been on the books for centuries in this country—and almost always survive constitutional scrutiny. (Many were adopted in response to the Ku Klux Klan’s use of hoods and masks to hide identities as members terrorized black communities. Now that mask wearing is allowed, and encouraged by the left, perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us that the California man who wore a Klan mask to go shopping last week will not be charged.) But there is something about the affirmative choice to refuse to wear a mask right now that feels connected to yet another distinctly American pathology. Just as some dissenters resoundingly fail to understand that the First Amendment doesn’t give them the right to be heard and seen by everyone at all times, or to say whatever they wish without consequences, some appear to believe that their right to perform their freedom, up to and including with weapons of war, is constitutionally limitless. Right now, the right to breathe unobstructed into everyone in your path is, in its way, a weapon. And wanting the world to see your face unobstructed as you do so feels like a damaged idea of freedom. Historically, masks were preferred by mobs who wanted to do violence unrecognized. Now the masks impair the performance of violence, and the credit and fame that go with it.

Because we are in the midst of a reality show presidency, in which the unending public performance of self by the president is the only coin of the realm, it is hardly surprising that Donald Trump refuses to be masked. The carnival, the play, the show, after all, is the entirety of governance. And that people who believe that the hallmark of constitutional democracy is the loud, unfettered performance of self, regardless of its consequences for others, similarly refuse to go unseen and uncredited, is the obvious corollary. If you maintain that your freedom to ritually enact your ineffable you-ness at the expense of everyone else is what makes America different, it stands to reason that masks feel akin to tyranny. As Lydia Denworth put it in Scientific American, one of the reasons the wearing of masks has never become a norm in America is that the impulse to think collectively about disease was never necessarily fully integrated: “The point is that masks do not just protect the wearer, they protect others. Such community-minded thinking fits with collectivist cultural norms in some parts of Asia, where masks are routinely worn when one is sick—and where there is more experience with serious epidemics.”

This may even explain why some root their refusal to cover up in religious arguments, also swept in under the First Amendment. An Ohio lawmaker, Republican state Rep. Nino Vitale, declined to wear the mask required by his state’s Department of Health director, because, as he explained in a Facebook post last week, “This is the greatest nation on earth founded on Judeo-Christian principles. One of those principles is that we are all created in the image and likeness of God. That image is seen the most by our face. I will not wear a mask.” His logic was uniquely illogical: “No one is stopping anybody from wearing a face mask. But quite frankly everyone else’s freedom ends at the tip of my nose. You’re not going to tell me what to do and there’s a lot of people that feel that way.” The idea that God wants to see our faces so very badly that we should be allowed to harm and possibly kill everyone with whom we come in contact is a uniquely self-regarding view of religious faith. But if one believes that the self is the only meaningful actor in a democracy, or a theocracy, it perhaps stands to reason.

The simplest explanation for the insistence that wearing masks is for thee, but not for me, rests in the fundamental narcissism of Donald Trump, and the booming cottage industry on the part of right-wing media in so-called vice-signaling—the performative acting out of malice and cruelty toward the weak. The more complicated answer, it seems, is that in a country founded on a long mythology of the Lone Ranger, Batman, Zorro, and Captain America, the mask has somehow come to signal invisibility, and the death of rugged individualism—perhaps even more so because everyone is now wearing one. For those who have come to feel devalued, degraded, left behind, or shunted aside, being asked to hide one’s face must be the ultimate act of public cruelty. If we have come to believe that each of us is only as important as our ability to be seen and heard, the mask must make that erasure complete. It’s not just the toxic myth of rugged individuals pitted against government and the weak that is gutting us. It’s the poisonous notion that unless we are being seen acting out rugged individualism, we don’t even exist.

868,868,1040,J.C. Penney files for bankruptcy protection,"J.C. Penney, one of America's most recognizable clothing stores, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy late Friday. In doing so, the 118-year-old store became the latest major retailer to succumb to a sales slump during the coronavirus pandemic.

J.C. Penney was one of many brick-and-mortar stores forced to temporarily close its locations as the pandemic spread across the U.S. The closures put J.C. Penney a step closer to bankruptcy, the company said Friday.

CEO Jill Soltau said in a statement Friday that J.C. Penney's leadership made significant progress toward rebuilding the company, but ""the closure of our stores due to the pandemic necessitated a more fulsome review to include the elimination of outstanding debt.""

J.C. Penney officials said its physical and online stores will remain open during the bankruptcy restructuring. The company has already begun reopening some locations, including in Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Texas. The Plano-based clothing store filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. Southern District of Texas.

Although the pandemic further dented J.C. Penney, the store has been declining for years amid the growth in e-commerce, and is weighed down by $4 billion in debt. It has closed numerous stores in recent years to cut costs.

J.C. Penney has $500 million in cash and has commitments from lenders for another $900 million to help the company get through its structuring, company officials said. J.C. Penney plans to close more stores as part of the bankruptcy, but company officials didn't specify which ones or how many.

Soltau said bankruptcy ""is the best path to ensure that JCPenney will build on its over 100-year history to serve our customers for decades to come.""

J.C. Penney, which has roughly 85,000 employees, has now joined Neiman Marcus and J. Crew among the retailers to go bankrupt since the virus struck. In its most recent quarter J.C. Penney's sales fell nearly 8%, to $3.4 billion, from the year-ago period, while income was $27 million, down from $75 million a year ago. J.C. Penney missed two debt payments in April and May, which many analysts saw as a harbinger of bankruptcy.

""J.C. Penney actually embraced e-commerce earlier than most other U.S. department store chains, but the company did not capitalize on this head start,"" Bob Hoyler, senior research analyst at Euromonitor International, said in a statement to CBS News. ""J.C. Penney has not been able to survive on its e-commerce sales alone during the pandemic, so the forced store closures represent months of revenue that will simply never be recouped.""

The company's bankruptcy comes days after J.C. Penney gave its top executives millions of dollars in bonus pay. CEO Jill Soltau received $4.5 million, while chief financial officer Bill Wafford, chief merchant officer Michelle Wlazlo and chief human resources officer Brynn Evanson each got $1 million, the company disclosed in a May 10 regulatory filing.

Large companies give so-called retention bonuses to top executives to encourage corporate leaders to remain on board as the company restructures and, if possible, exit court supervision as stronger competitors.

J.C. Penney shares grew 21% after the market closed Friday, then fell by more than 30% during after-hours trading.",1
965,965,1158,Bike Sales Gear Up As The Homebound Try Socially Distant Exercise,"Bike Sales Gear Up As The Homebound Try Socially Distant Exercise

Enlarge this image toggle caption Tony Dejak/AP Tony Dejak/AP

Sales are booming at many bike shops around the country, as people stuck at home try something new for exercise and essential workers adapt to scaled-down public transit.

It's an especially opportune time for those who might otherwise be nervous about sharing the streets with cars — mayors across the country have closed streets to encourage cyclists and joggers to exercise.

""Stores are doing really well, and store owners who I've spoken to over the past couple months are almost sheepish in admitting that because they understand it's a pandemic,"" says Morgan Lommele, director of state and local policy at the industry coalition group People for Bikes.

In the majority of states that issued stay-at-home orders, bike shops were deemed essential businesses that could stay open, according to tracking by the League of American Bicyclists.

Bike sales in March were up by 50% over last year, the market research firm The NPD Group found. Including stationary exercise bikes, sales grew by 31% in the first quarter of the year over the same time last year.

""We're seeing families, individuals riding bikes in droves, more than we've seen over the last 20 years,"" said Lommele in an interview with NPR's All Things Considered.

Many retailers are running low on bikes, which often have to be ordered from manufacturers far in advance. ""There was no way to really predict this back in December and January,"" Lommele says.

The best-selling bikes have been in the $600 to $1,500 range, she says, which is the bulk of the market.

The pandemic has also forced new stresses onto bike shop employees, who must now contend with social distancing and cleanliness guidelines in a hands-on business.

And a large part of any bike shop's operations are not just sales, but service. When someone who hasn't ridden in years dusts off the old Schwinn for a socially distanced ride, it will need a tuneup.

But many shops have closed voluntarily or sent employees home. As of a month ago, an estimated 20-30% of shops were closed, according to Bicycle Retailer and Industry News.

That means more demand for repairs at the shops that stayed open. Independent bike shops saw repairs go up by 20%, The NPD Group found.

""There's this environment where, sure, shops are seeing record-level sales, record-level demand for service, but their employees are either staying at home or on restricted schedules,"" Lommele says.

Retailers and manufacturers are talking about a ""mini bike boom."" It's a shift from the focus of the last couple years — tariffs.

The vast majority of bicycles and parts in the U.S. come from China. But the Trump administration, in various rounds of tariffs, put many bicycle parts under tariffs of 25% above normal rates.

Many bike products have since been granted exclusions to tariffs, but the exclusions are set to expire in August and September.

McDonald's McMuffin

The Disney Parks Blog isn't the only place people can find famous recipes. McDonald's UK, which has closed all its locations in the United Kingdom and Ireland, shared on Twitter how to make a sausage and egg McMuffin.

Want to make the meal creamier while staying true to the original? Use butter instead of liquid margarine. In 2015, the fast-food chain made a key ingredient switch, announcing that it would use butter instead of margarine across all its breakfast items. Before then, it had used margarine to toast biscuits and English muffins and to cook eggs.

Yesterday, President Vladimir Putin admitted that it could be possible to use ""opportunities"" and ""reserves"" of the Ministry of Defense in the fight against the spread of coronavirus in Russia. Representatives of the ministry said, however, that they estimate the situation with the coronavirus infection in the armed forces as ""unstable.""

As of March 30, three Russian military personnel were confirmed positive for COVID-19 infection, at least 133 more people remain under medical observation due to their contacts with the infected.



The Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation decided not to cancel the spring draft and intends to recruit 135,000 conscripts, although they are not going to be sent to military troops in the near future.

The epidemiological situation in the Russian armed forces is unstable, an unnamed source said. The ministry has prepared nearly 5,000 beds at 32 military hospitals, 11 of which ""are ready for work within four hours under strict anti-epidemic conditions."" Forty-nine mobile sanitary-epidemiological groups were also set up for an operational response. The Ministry has 2 million medical disposable masks, 15,000 respirators, 100 insulating transport capsules, 10,000 disposable suits for infectious disease specialists, 3,000 medical protective suits of the Quartz type and continues purchasing necessary items.

It is worth noting that even in an emergency-case scenario, Russia will not be able to directly take advantage of the experience gained abroad. All military personnel arriving from foreign trips undergo a ""mandatory two-week observation"". This also applies to military doctors who are now serving in Italy and Serbia.",0
1020,1020,1216,Germany is reopening with one of the lowest death rates in the world. Here's how it barely missed a trick as it fought the coronavirus.,"The German response to the coronavirus has led the way in Europe and drawn praise around the world.

Its initial success in containing the outbreak was attributed in March to mass testing, swift lockdown, a robust healthcare system, and luck.

But that success has continued into April and May, and the country is now gradually reopening with one of the lowest death rates in the world.

Regardless, the country remains cautious. The Bundestag on Thursday passed a new law mandating more testing and virus mapping, which it hopes will rid the outbreak for good.

The country had its critics along the way, but here's how it got in sight of the finish line.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

On balance, Germany has dealt with its coronavirus outbreak much better than most nations around the world.

The peak of its outbreak — the period marked by the highest numbers of new daily infections — came between March 26 and April 3, during which it maintained a death rate far below the likes of Spain and Italy.

As Business Insider reported in late March, this was attributed to an early lockdown, swift mass-testing drive, a well-oiled healthcare system, and clear government messaging.

Seven weeks on — as the country starts to reopen — not much has changed.

The reproduction number (R) — which indicates how many people the average person infects, and indicates how fast the virus is spreading — has wholly remained below 1, but for one surge from 0.65 to 1.1 last weekend.

But the country weathered the storm with minimal fuss, and its R rate subsided to 0.8 by Wednesday.

Authorities said the surge was caused by outbreaks in a few nursing homes and a factory. North Rhine-Westphalia, where the factory was located, reacted by briefly reimposing lockdown, it ended on Friday.

""If one compares the German death rate with that of other countries, it becomes clear that the number of deaths in Germany has not increased as much as one might have feared,"" Die Zeit newspaper, whose virus tracker has become a go-to resource in Germany, wrote on May 14.

Even so, the government is continuing to move against the virus with purpose.

The Infection Protection Act

On Thursday, the Bundestag passed the Infection Protection Act, a set of precautions to help steer the country from danger as it begins returning to normal.

Testing in care homes and hospitals will be drastically increased. Germany is already testing hundreds of thousands of people a week.

Health authorities must log every negative test result and people considered ""cured,"" so the government can map the virus.

Nurses and care workers will be entitled to a 1,000-euro ($1,080) bonus. Before the crisis there was a shortage of these key workers due to low wages.

Health insurers must now pay for their customers' antibody tests even if they have no symptoms.

Health insurers must make flu vaccines readily available. As winter nears, the government wants to minimize the strain that flu patients place on health services.

'We are seeing half-empty ICUs'

In recent weeks, Germany kept testing people en masse, monitoring those who test positive, and kept intensive care units remained well under capacity.

It allowed those in the most critical of conditions quick, unfettered access to life-saving apparatus like ventilators.

""We are seeing half-empty ICUs in Germany,"" the country's lead epidemiologist, Christian Drosten, said on April 26.

""This is because we started diagnostics early and on a broad scale, and we stopped the epidemic — that is, we brought the reproduction number below 1.""

Germany currently has the capacity to test around 838,000 samples for COVID-19 per week, Reuters reported on Tuesday.

Those who test positive are supervised closely, even after they return to recover in their homes.

In Heidelberg, southwestern Germany, medics were driving around the city checking in on those recently diagnosed with COVID-19, taking blood tests and checking to see if they had deteriorated, The New York Times reported in April.

A lockdown so effective it almost backfired

Drosten, who is director of Berlin's Institute of Virology, added he was concerned the lockdown had worked so well that some citizens didn't understand the dangers of the virus.

Indeed, protests against the lockdown popped up across Germany on April 25. More have taken place since.

While there was strong support for social distancing, and widespread acceptance of a lockdown, many Germans also felt that the state went too far and was ruining the economy.

Ten thousand anti-lockdown protesters are now expected to amass in Munich on May 16.

""For many Germans I'm the evil guy who is crippling the economy,"" Drosten said on April 26.

While Spain and Italy saw death rates as high as 10% in late March, Germany's death rate around the same time — on March 27 — was 0.74%.

Their success was attributed to four factors:

Testing: In March, between 120,000 and 500,000 people were tested each week, according to various reports. One month later, the UK was yet to match the lower end of that estimate.

Luck: As of March 27, the average age of a German infected with coronavirus was 46, whereas in Italy it was 63. Older people are on average far more likely to die from the virus.

Germany sees the light at the end of the tunnel

Germany has started reopening some schools and allowed businesses and religious venues to open their doors. It also plans to reopen its borders to neighboring countries by June 15.

In some states, museums and restaurants have been open for more than a week.

On Saturday, the Bundesliga soccer league will recommence. It is the first major league in the world to do so, but for safety the stands will remain empty for the rest of the season, and team handshakes are banned.

The Interior Ministry said on Friday that new arrivals from the EU, Schengen area, and UK would not be forced into a mandatory two-week quarantine upon arrival. Those from other nations, like the US, would.

As of Thursday, 7,917 people have died, with 174,824 confirmed cases. The death rate is at 4.5%.

The rate has risen because it takes a number of weeks for those who eventually die from the the virus to be admitted to hospital, and then enter intensive care.

Germany's death rate is still very low compared to other nations. It is 14% in the UK, 6% in the US, and 15% in France.

On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel was asked how people should act now the lockdown was ending. ""Social distancing, face masks, and respect,"" she said.

The country's troubles are far from over, though. It is already in a recession, and warned late last month of the worst economic slump in its history this year.

""The German economy has been tip-toeing on the edge of recession since the beginning of 2019, but it can hide no longer,"" said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

""The economy entered a technical recession at the start of the year, and this before the incoming collapse.""

The economy shrank 2.2% in the first three months of 2020, according to the German statistics agency on Friday.

Nonetheless, when it comes to the coronavirus, Germany has been the envy of many other countries — particularly those that were slow to respond to their own outbreaks.

As a source at the UK Department of Health told The Sunday Times in April: ""We could have been Germany.""",1
112,112,160,The COVID-19 pandemic is generating tons of medical waste,"Garbage contaminated with bodily fluids or other infectious materials is becoming a bigger concern for hospitals as they brace for a surge in patients sick with COVID-19 in the US. Patients and health care workers are quickly going through medical supplies and disposable personal protective equipment, like masks. Eventually all that used gear piles up as medical waste that needs to be safely discarded.

In Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus first emerged, officials didn’t just need to build new hospitals for the influx of patients; they had to construct a new medical waste plant and deploy 46 mobile waste treatment facilities too. Hospitals there generated six times as much medical waste at the peak of the outbreak as they did before the crisis began. The daily output of medical waste reached 240 metric tons, about the weight of an adult blue whale.

Hospitals generated 6 times as much medical waste

There’s already been an uptick of garbage from personal protective equipment in the US, according to medical waste company Stericycle, which handled 1.8 billion pounds of medical waste globally in 2018. And some things that aren’t usually considered medical waste, like food, now need to be handled more carefully after coming in contact with a COVID-19 patient. Stericycle didn’t provide numbers for how much of an increase it’s seeing so far, adding that it believes it has the capacity to handle the swell and may add shifts to the company’s 50 treatment centers in the US if necessary. Additionally, the drop in elective surgeries might offset some of the rise in waste we’re seeing from the pandemic, a spokesperson for Stericycle tells The Verge.

“It’s a rapidly changing environment right now and forecasting volumes is challenging,” Stericycle Vice President of Corporate Communications Jennifer Koenig wrote in an email to The Verge. “We are closely monitoring the situation with all relevant agencies to determine next steps.”

“It’s a rapidly changing environment”

The CDC says that medical waste from COVID-19 can be treated the same way as regular medical waste. Regulations on how to treat that waste vary by location and can be governed by state health and environmental departments, as well as by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Department of Transportation. Generally, to make sure contaminated trash from health care facilities doesn’t pose any harm to the public before going to a landfill, it’s typically burned, sterilized with steam, or chemically disinfected.

There’s more to worry about than waste from medical centers. The disease is spread out beyond hospitals. Some people who have minor symptoms are recovering at home. Others who are asymptomatic might not know that the trash they’re throwing out could be contaminated. That means people may be generating plenty of virus-laden trash. That’s worrying for sanitation workers, as the virus can persist for up to a day on cardboard and for longer on metal and plastic, according to one study of the virus in lab conditions.

But if garbage is properly bagged instead of kept loose and workers are wearing personal protective equipment, especially gloves, then there shouldn’t be a risk of catching the virus, David Biderman, CEO of the Solid Waste Association of North America, tells The Verge. Practicing social distancing while on the job, including maintaining appropriate distances from people, may also help reduce sanitation workers’ risks, says Elise Paeffgen, a partner with the firm Alston & Bird who works on medical waste issues.

People handling health care waste should wear appropriate gear

People handling health care waste in particular should wear appropriate gear, including boots, aprons, long-sleeved gowns, thick gloves, masks, and goggles or face shields, according to recommendations from the World Health Organization. Luckily, protective efforts so far seem to have paid off. “There is no evidence that direct, unprotected human contact during the handling of health care waste has resulted in the transmission of the COVID-19 virus,” according to a March 19th technical brief from the WHO. As the pandemic grows, so will the waste, and keeping that garbage safe and contained will continue to be a challenge for communities until the crisis is over.",1
132,132,185,State extends pot business application deadline amid COVID-19 pandemic,"State officials have once again extended the deadline for applications for certain recreational cannabis business licenses amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed an executive order Saturday extending the deadline to submit applications for cannabis infuser, craft grower and transporter licenses from March 30 to April 30, according to a statement from the Illinois Department of Agriculture. All applications must be submitted by certified mail.

The applications were initially due March 16, but state officials earlier this month extended that deadline and ordered the agriculture department to accept all applications by mail in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.

The 40 licenses to operate small-scale grow centers will be awarded by July 1. Another 40 licenses will go to infusers which will manufacture processed pot products, like edibles. An unspecified number of transport licenses will allow companies to deliver marijuana on behalf of growers, dispensaries or community colleges with licensed pot training programs.

“While there is no limit on how many transporter licenses will be awarded, applicants must score at least 75% of the available points and meet all other requirements before being granted a transporter license,” the agriculture department wrote in the statement.

Application fees of $5,000 will be cut in half for applicants that meet social equity requirements by living in an area adversely affected by past drug policies, having a pot-related record or having a family member that meets the criteria.

The licenses carry an annual $40,000 fee for craft growers, $10,000 for transporters and $5,000 for infusers.",1

Stories When living in a crisis is a job: lockdown survival tips from seasoned pros. Part 3: Polar Explorer

As the 'coronacrisis' poses one challenge after another, people are struggling to adapt to a new reality. RTD explores how people who endured hardship in their line of work handle isolation, uncertainty, and health risks – conditions many of us are experiencing during the coronavirus pandemic. In a series of short interviews, a cosmonaut, a submariner, and a polar explorer explain how to stay focused and even benefit from the current misfortunes.

The third hero is Viktor Boyarsky, an Honoured Polar Explorer of Russia, member of the Russian Geographical Society and the National Geographic Society of the United States, Chairman of the Polar Commission. He explains how a polar expedition can bring out the worst in people, what is the best way to fight loneliness, and what happens if you run out of food in the middle of an icy waste.

Polar explorers spend a lot of time away from their families. Today, a lot of people separated from their families by the lockdown, have to go through the same ordeal. From your experience, what is the best way to cope with this?

On the move, Greenland, 1988/Viktor Boyarsky's personal archive

For a polar explorer, living away from your family for a year or more is one of the most challenging things. But then again, we know about this in advance, it doesn't take us by surprise. Do you remember the book, The Count of Monte Cristo? This man has just got married, and suddenly, he's thrown to jail for 18 years – that was so unexpected, so horrible, so hard to come to terms with. But with modern means of communication, even Antarctica has internet access, not to mention other ways to stay in touch.

How does it feel to be cut off from civilisation all the time? What is the most annoying or frustrating thing about it? How did you deal with this feeling?

Actually, everyone would like to find themselves away from the civilisation once. As the famous Russian bard Vladimir Vysotsky put it, 'North is freedom, hope, land without borders.' You get out of the tent, you look around, and you see snow, purity, ice. You can just let everything go; there's nothing around you that might upset you. I've been married for 46 years, and a total of 16 years I spent away from my family.

Polar explorers have to stay in a confined space with colleagues for months on end. Under lockdown, many people are limited to their small apartments, with their families. How did you manage that?

Chronicles of the Double Pole Expedition, Arctic Ocean, 1995/Viktor Boyarsky's personal archive

Polar explorers have nothing to worry about; they're like pilots, cosmonauts, submariners, they all put themselves in the lockdown voluntarily. With professions like these, you just take it for granted. What matters is that you have a job that needs to be done.

I went on some extreme expeditions. Usually, polar explorers live at research stations. You can get some privacy there; spend some time on your own. And when you're on an expedition, you have to stay in a tent for a long time. But even then, here's what we did: there were six of us (two men per tent), and we switched every six weeks, so it didn't get too boring.

What things could lead to conflict? How did you resolve disputes?

It all depends on a person's life experience, to what extent they are ready to cooperate with others in an extraordinary situation, to avoid any escalation. Sometimes, you have to look for common ground, agreeing to things that you would deem unthinkable in any other situation. Being able to compromise under duress is a sign of strength, not weakness. When someone insists on doing things their way, it could result in a conflict. So, you should take one step back, give way, even if it's against your principles – in this situation, it'd be justified.

Did you pick people that you knew would be able to cooperate well?

International Trans-Greenland Expedition, 1988/Viktor Boyarsky's personal archive

You don't pick your team beforehand; it happens on its own. Usually, when the station is established, people are hired according to their professional skills. And then, during the winter camp, people gradually get used to each other. Later, it becomes apparent, who will work together next time, and who will never work with each other. A stationmaster writes character references, they determine the future of these people. Who's not recommended for working at the winter camp, who's too difficult, uncooperative or unsociable. That's how people are filtered out.

What is the absolute no-go when you're in a confined space with peers/relatives? Joking, gossiping?

It's not just about staying in a confined space; it's about being able to live with a small select group of people. That's when the true character is revealed, the traits that remained hidden before. In such situations, you should try to avoid hurting other people's feelings. You should put aside your ambitions for the time being, and observe everything that is going on around you carefully.

The loneliness. What would you recommend those people who spend the lockdown on their own? How can they avoid sinking into despair?

When you get the blues, you should try to look at the situation from 'it could've been worse' perspective. You should always compare what you could've had and what you've got – it helps to see things from a universal human standpoint. Then you'll stop worrying about 'oh, someone took my bowl or my glass,' such things start to seem a mere trifle, it's sobering.

The fear. People have a lot of worries too – to get sick, to leave their dependents to their own devices, the fear of the unknown. What fears did you face in expeditions, how did you overcome them? Can your methods help our readers?

Through the ice drifts and towards the North Pole, 2003/Viktor Boyarsky's personal archive

During our major expedition, when we walked to Antarctica, the prevailing fear was to contract some serious illness. In our situation, we couldn't expect help from anywhere. We would've just remained there. Despite this, there is no flu or colds in the Arctic and Antarctica; there are no viruses. All the infection is brought from the mainland when the teams are swapped. After that, the entire station comes down with something. But generally, all the polar explorers undergo medical examination before being dispatched to an expedition. Some severe conditions might show up there. The heart might fail, for example. We had such examples.

As for resources, in an expedition, they are calculated according to how much supplies one person needs per day. Sometimes, you run out of food. But today, you can always request help from the station. They either bring you supplies or take you from there.

If someone hurts himself, the rest share his work among them. But if a person feels really sick, you can call for a rescue plane. Later, when this person gets better, they make up for lost time – do a day's worth of work in half a day, and so on.",0
838,838,1007,Oklahoma nail salon worker contracted the coronavirus shortly after the business reopened,"A nail salon in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, said an employee tested positive for COVID-19 — just days after it reopened.

""We have received a positive COVID-19 test from a staff member who was in the salon on May 5-7,"" The Nailspot said in a May 13 Facebook post. ""If you were in the salon on these days you could have been potentially exposed.""

Oklahoma allowed nail salons and other ""personal contact"" businesses to reopen on April 24.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The Nailspot opened its doors for the first time in weeks on May 5. Just over a week later, the beauty parlor in northeast Oklahoma is closing them again after an employee was infected with the coronavirus.

""We have received a positive COVID-19 test from a staff member who was in the salon on May 5-7,"" the Bartlesville shop announced in a May 13 post on Facebook. ""If you were in the salon on these days you could have been potentially exposed.""

It's not clear where the employee contracted the novel coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as COVID-19.

""Washington County Health Department recommends that any customer that was in the salon during this time self-isolate for 14 days and if symptoms arise to contact Washington County Health Dept for further information and instruction,"" the salon wrote in its Facebook post. Nailspot plans to reopen on May 26.

Oklahoma was one of the first states to begin reopening its economy during the pandemic, with Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, allowing salons, spas, and pet groomers to resume service on April 24.

Restaurants, gyms, and movie theaters followed suit on May 1.

In California, by contrast, authorities have refused to allow nail salons, in particular, to reopen.

""This whole thing started in the state of California, the first community spread, in a nail salon,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed in a May 7 address. ""I just want to remind everybody of that and that I'm very worried about that,"" he added, though — to the consternation of salon owners — he did not provide supporting evidence.

Oklahoma's guidelines on reopening call for increased handwashing at such ""personal contact"" establishments, noting that ""[r]emaining six feet apart as in other businesses is not possible.""

The guidelines do not call for either employees or customers to wear masks, suggesting only that employees consider wearing them ""if the customer requests.""

In a May 3 post announcing its plans to reopen, the salon suggested that clients bring their own masks. ""If you do not have one, we will try to provide you with one,"" it said.

At least 284 people have died from COVID-19 in Oklahoma, according to the state government. Six new deaths were announced May 14, down from nine fatalities announced May 5, when The Nailspot reopened — the same number of deaths announced April 24, when salons were legally permitted to resume business.",1
1075,1075,1280,Sweden won’t dodge economic hit despite COVID-19 light touch,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1
388,388,484,Baseball Hall of Fame cancels July inductions because of coronavirus,"Ken “Hawk” Harrelson, Derek Jeter, Larry Walker and the rest of this year’s Baseball Hall of Fame class will have to wait another year for their big moment at Cooperstown.

The Hall of Fame announced Wednesday that it has canceled the July 26 induction ceremony because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Instead, the class will be included at next year’s induction festivities on July 25, 2021.

Former White Sox play-by-play man Harrelson was set to be inducted as the Ford C. Frick Award winner for excellence in broadcasting as part of a class that also included former players Jeter, Walker and Ted Simmons and longtime union chief Marvin Miller.

A record crowd had been expected this summer at the small town in upstate New York to honor Jeter, the former New York Yankees captain who was elected in January by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America.

This will be the first year without an induction ceremony since 1960.

‘‘I think it’s the right thing to do, I really do,’’ Harrelson said Tuesday. ‘‘They were going to have 100,000 people there, with Yankee fans coming in from all over the world with Derek Jeter. I wouldn’t want my family going up there.’’

432,432,534,The Most Important Advice for Parents to Encourage Math in Children Amid Lockdown,"Not every child is born with skills to solve math equations and divide and multiply swiftly. Most of them struggle with calculations, algebra, and graphs. And the approach most parents take in pushing them toward the ability is through destructive and degrading feedback. Yes, math is an essential part of the world, and without this basic skill, no person can succeed in life. But there are better ways of infusing this mindset in children than by force.

Administering the latest situation of complete or partial lockdown in all coronavirus infected countries, with no sign of educational institutes reopening, you as a parent may be more than ever worried about the math education of your children. Teachers and school administrations are doing their best with video lectures, but the engagement and productive factors are lessened.

In a time like this, the best thing you can do is take it upon yourself to give your child the math education they truly need. This can be done by showing them real-life examples of math problems. Most kids aren’t good at math because they don’t understand how it works and aren’t able to apply it in everyday life.

In addition to including real-life problems, you can make use of the internet by downloading highly interactive math puzzles, math educating games and apps, fun math videos, and more. Take out the board games that have been eating dust in your attic to play with your kids, as several of them are related to math problem-solving. Or make games by yourself using cutout numbers and math symbols for kids to learn and have fun.",0
949,949,1131,Starbucks is asking landlords for a break on rent,"What do millions of Americans and Starbucks have in common? Both want a break on the rent.

According to The Seattle Times, the coffee giant is pressing landlords to offer rent relief for its stores, citing the coronavirus's impact on sales. ""Effective June 1, and for at least a period of 12 consecutive months, Starbucks will require concessions to support modified operations and adjustments to lease terms and base rent structures,"" Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer wrote in a May letter to landlords.

Starbucks hasn't said where around the U.S. it is asking for rent relief. Chief Financial Officer Patrick Grismer said during the company's most recent earnings call that ""we've not yet confirmed those arrangements, and it's really premature to indicate what that relief may look like.""

Like many retailers, Starbucks's business has been deeply affected by the pandemic. It temporarily closed 2,000 restaurants across China after the outbreak erupted in Wuhan. China and the U.S. account for 61% of Starbuck's presence worldwide, with 15,257 stores in the U.S. and 4,351 in China. Starbucks plans to reopen 90% of its U.S. locations in early June.

U.S. retail sales hit record low as Trump looks ahead to reopening economy

Starbucks reported $6 billion in revenue during the second quarter, down 5% from the previous year, while store sales globally fell 10% from the previous year.

Coronavirus has caused ""a staggering economic crisis,"" and ""the psychological and economic scars will last for months, if not years,"" Brewer wrote in the letter. Brick-and-mortar retailers won't reach the same level of sales and income as before the pandemic, so landlords must be willing to ""adapt to new realities,"" she wrote, according to the Seattle Times.

""This is the worst recession since the Great Depression and far more devastating than the global financial crisis,"" Brewer wrote. ""What lays ahead is daunting but by no means insurmountable with a shared commitment and a clear path forward.""",1
1158,1158,1445,"Trump’s use of unproven drug to ward off covid-19 prompts concerns, ridicule. It’s not for the ‘morbidly obese,’ says Pelosi.","But those dire warnings appear to have done little to change the president’s opinion. On Monday, toward the end of a roundtable event with restaurant industry executives at the White House, Trump offered his strongest endorsement of the drug to date.



“I’m taking it — hydroxychloroquine,” Trump said. “Right now.”

He later told reporters: “I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this … you know, when I announced this. But, yeah, I have taken it for about a week and a half now, and I’m still here. I’m still here.”



Trump’s announcement that he has been taking the drug in combination with zinc for about 10 days as a preventive measure against the novel virus prompted numerous questions, reactions and concerns, including an unflattering suggestion from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that the president shouldn’t be using the medicine because he is “morbidly obese.”

“He’s our president, and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists,” Pelosi said on CNN in a now-viral clip, “especially in his age group, and in his, shall we say, weight group: ‘Morbidly obese,’ they say.”



“I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group, and in his, shall we say, weight group: ‘Morbidly obese,’ they say,” says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Pres. Trump’s revelation he is taking hydroxychloroquine. pic.twitter.com/0ImjpEjg9q — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) May 19, 2020

It all began Monday with a question about whistleblowers, which prompted Trump to launch into a lengthy tirade that started with Ukraine and impeachment before turning to the most recent whistleblower to draw his anger: former top vaccine official Rick Bright.



“See whether or not he was a big contributor to the Democrats. See whether or not he wanted the Democrats to win,” Trump told reporters, referring to Bright. “There’s a lot of bad things coming out about him, but you people don’t want to write the news.”

Trump appeared to be angered by Bright’s comments from a “60 Minutes” segment that aired Sunday. In the interview, Bright, who claims he was retaliated against last month for raising concerns about hydroxychloroquine, continued his criticism of the federal government’s handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, calling the response slow and chaotic.



On Monday, Trump pointed out it was Bright who had signed a request to the Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine to treat covid-19.

“Now, if he doesn’t believe in it, why would he sign it?” Trump said, before abruptly pivoting to his startling revelation.



“A lot of good things have come out about the hydroxy. A lot of good things have come out,” Trump continued. “You’d be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the front-line workers, before you catch it. The front-line workers, many, many are taking it.”

Then, the president revealed front-line workers are not the only group of people taking the drug to protect against the virus. He is, too.



Following a brief pause as reporters digested the news, multiple voices rang out all at once with the same follow-up question: “You’re taking hydroxychloroquine?”

Trump’s claim unleashed a torrent of queries from the journalists in the room — and number of the same questions were repeatedly raised throughout the night as politicians, medical professionals and the general public were left puzzled over the president’s decision.



Chief among the questions that emerged Monday was “why?” Why would the president start taking a drug that experts say has no proven ability to protect against covid-19 and also has potentially deadly side effects?

“Because I think it’s good,” Trump said.



Up against the weight of scientific opinion, he offered “a lot of good stories” that he has heard about it. “And if it’s not good, I’ll tell you. … I’m not going to get hurt by it. It’s been around for 40 years for malaria, for lupus, for other things.”

Trump again claimed front-line workers and “a lot of doctors” take hydroxychloroquine, but he provided no details. He also repeatedly cited letters and calls he said he has received from people heralding the drug’s effects, often referring to one note from an unnamed doctor near Westchester, N.Y.



“He just said, ‘Sir, I have hundreds of patients and I give them hydroxychloroquine; I give them the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin; and I give them zinc,’ ” Trump said, appearing to quote the letter from memory. “ ‘And out of the hundreds of patients — many hundreds, over 300 patients — I haven’t lost one.’ ”



The reporters, however, kept pressing.

“Did the White House doctor recommend that you take that? Is that why you’re taking it?” one asked.

“No, I asked him, ‘What do you think?’ ” Trump said, recalling the conversation with the White House physician. “He said, ‘Well, if you’d like it.’ I said, ‘Yeah, I’d like it. I’d like to take it.’ ”

Later Monday, the White House released a letter from Sean P. Conley, Trump’s in-house physician, that confirmed he had spoken with the president about the drug.



“After numerous discussions he and I had for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks,” Conley wrote.



But the letter did not specify whether Conley had written Trump a prescription for hydroxychloroquine or if the president is actually taking “a pill every day,” as he said during Monday’s event.

“I’m taking the two: the zinc and the hydroxy,” Trump said. “And all I can tell you is, so far, I seem to be okay.”

One reporter went on to inquire about another possibility for Trump’s decision to start the regimen, given recent news that at least two people in the White House, including a personal valet to the president, have tested positive for coronavirus.

“Have you been exposed?” the reporter asked.

“No, not at all,” Trump responded, later stressing he has “zero symptoms” and has consistently negative test results.





As Trump continued touting the drug, it didn’t take long for someone to ask, “What is the evidence that it has a preventive effect?”

“Here we go, you ready? Here’s my evidence,” the president said, spreading his hands wide. “I get a lot of positive calls about it.”

Trump noted that the “only negative” feedback he has heard about the drug comes from an analysis done by academic researchers that examined the medical records of 368 male patients at Veterans Affairs hospitals nationwide and found the drug was linked to higher rates of death for those hospitalized with the coronavirus. According to the April study, more than 27 percent of patients who received hydroxychloroquine died, and 22 percent of patients who were treated with a combination of the drug and the antibiotic azithromycin also died. In comparison, the death rate for those who did not receive the drugs was 11.4 percent.



“The only negative I’ve heard was the study where they gave it — was it the VA? With, you know, people that aren’t big Trump fans gave it,” Trump said, adding, “It was a very unscientific report, by the way. But I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy. And I say, ‘Hey.’ You know the expression I’ve used …? ‘What do you have to lose?’ Okay? ‘What do you have to lose?’ ”

Medical experts quickly rejected Trump’s dismissal of safety concerns.

“There is NO evidence for [hydroxychloroquine] being effective in treatment of #covid19 or prophylaxis to prevent the disease,” tweeted Leana S. Wen, former Baltimore city health commissioner and a contributing columnist to The Washington Post. “This is a medication that has serious side effects.”

There is NO evidence for hydrochloroquine being effective in treatment of #covid19 or prophylaxis to prevent the disease. This is a medication that has serious side effects. I am very concerned about @realDonaldTrump continuing to model behavior that could harm many Americans. — Leana Wen, M.D. (@DrLeanaWen) May 18, 2020

In an appearance on CNN, Sanjay Gupta, the network’s chief medical correspondent, said Trump “shouldn’t be taking” the drug.

“His own FDA has said that this is still something under investigation that should not be taken outside of a clinical trial,” Gupta said. “Only hospitalized patients should be getting it.”

While Gupta acknowledged Trump was right in saying the drug has been used to prevent malaria for decades, its use in people who already have coronavirus poses “some real concerns.”

Aside from the medical community, Trump’s comments also struck a nerve with a number of cable news personalities, most notably Fox News’s Neil Cavuto.

“If you are in a risky population here and you are taking this as a preventive treatment to ward off the virus, or in a worst-case scenario, you are dealing with the virus and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you,” Cavuto said during his Monday show. “I cannot stress enough: This will kill you.”

“Whatever benefits the president says this has, and certainly it has had for those suffering from malaria, dealing with lupus, this is a leap that should not be taken casually by those watching at home or assuming, well, the president of the United States says it’s okay,” Cavuto added. “Not to make a political point here, but a life and death point. Be very, very careful.”",1
773,773,942,Coronavirus death of 12-year-old prompts difficult questions,"Ernesto Guzman, age 12, on Thursday became the youngest Illinois resident known to have died from complications of COVID-19.

Ernesto was not a healthy boy, to be sure.

Since age 6, he had suffered the effects of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a genetic nerve condition that weakens muscles, usually of the lower extremities but sometimes respiratory muscles as well.

Opinion

Ernesto used a wheelchair or a walker and the help of his mother each morning to get out to the street in the front of their Gage Park bungalow to catch a van that until recently took him to Marquez Elementary, an ACERO charter school.

Ernesto also suffered from asthma and obstructive sleep apnea, two other underlying health problems with potentially serious consequences that have figured into many other COVID-19 deaths, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office.

But make no mistake, doctors say it was the coronavirus that caused the pneumonia that took Ernesto’s life early Thursday morning at Advocate Christ Medical Center, Oak Lawn.

Because his death occurred after midnight, it is not yet counted among the 3,928 official COVID-19 deaths in Illinois, but it was listed among the single-day record high of 126 deaths reported Thursday from Cook County by the medical examiner.

None of those individuals were younger than Ernesto. Previously, the youngest known victim was a 19-year-old man from Riverdale, who died April 10.

Early in the pandemic, state officials announced the death of a 9-month-old infant that they attributed to COVID, but that death remains under investigation by the Cook County Medical Examiner and has never been officially determined to be caused by the virus.

Will the death of a 12-year-old boy cause more people to take this disease seriously?

I doubt it.

Even now, I know someone is reading this and saying “but children die all the time,” and that is true. Children die all the time, and I realize more of them have died of something other than COVID-19 in the two months we’ve been in lockdown.

Still, what if he’s just the first child to die as the disease continues to spread, indeed if it accelerates as we accommodate the desires of those who want to visit their favorite bars and restaurants, or more to the point, the more understandable desire for the owners of those businesses to try to make money again?

There are other vulnerable children. Do we sacrifice them for the sake of the economy, knowing that the financial crisis will take its own toll?

I don’t know the answer to that. Personally, I wouldn’t want to take the risk just yet, but it’s easy for me to say, my family still secure and everyone drawing a paycheck.

Sometime in the last two months, Ernesto’s family moved from the Gage Park home to Indiana, neighbors said. A “For Rent” sign hung Thursday in the window.

In fact, the neighbors did not know Ernesto’s name, not even the children who lived across the street, because Ernesto did not come out and play with the other children, apparently because of his health.

A GoFundMe page that was opened Thursday to support his family showed Ernesto in a white suit at church. First communion maybe? Sorry, I don’t know my religious rituals. But I see a sweet boy.

Officials from Marquez Elementary issued a statement saying they were heartbroken to learn of his death.

“Ernesto was a cherished member of the Marquez community joining our family in Kindergarten through most of his sixth-grade year. Although he and his family recently relocated, he was still one of our Marshals and kept in close touch with his Marquez friends and teachers. He was a special member of our school community.”

“Ernesto loved Fortnite, art projects, science experiments, jokes and riddles, spending time with friends, and is remembered for being an incredibly sweet and loving confidant to everyone he met. We love Ernesto and will miss him with our whole heart.”

I reached a family member by phone. Through her tears, she said she did not speak English.

The man who came on the line next said politely: “We have no comment at this time.”

I’ll have to let their GoFundMe page do the talking.

Since his first surgery for Charcot-Marie-Tooth, Ernesto “has been fighting for his life with his strong spirit,” it states.

“While he may have been taken from us at such a young age, we will never forget the importance of unity and family he valued so much. He was constantly surrounded by love and happiness, and we know he’s made an impact on anyone he’s met.”

Take this seriously, folks. Take it very seriously, because the life you risk may not be your own.",1
398,398,494,How a team of NASA engineers developed a ventilator for COVID-19 patients in just a month,"Working as an engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, David Van Buren usually spends his time designing and building instruments for space telescopes or robots that will explore other worlds in our Solar System. But for the last month, Van Buren and a group of his colleagues at JPL have been working on a project that is truly unexplored terrain for them: making a ventilator to help patients sick with COVID-19.

While Van Buren had some previous experience in medical engineering, he’d never designed a ventilator before. But he and his co-workers at JPL are used to making things they don’t have any experience making. In fact, they’re used to making things that no one has experience making.

“We’re used to looking at new problems ... and figuring out how to do them.”

“When a scientist comes to us and says they want to go to a moon of Jupiter and drill into the ice and see what’s underneath, that’s something that’s never been done before,” Van Buren tells The Verge. “We’re used to looking at new problems — things people haven’t done before or at least that we haven’t done before — and figuring out how to do them.”

After a whirlwind 37 days of research, planning, and tinkering, a subset of engineers at JPL have created a prototype they’re calling the VITAL ventilator. A white digital box with a breathing tube attached, the ventilator is somewhere between the sophisticated high-end ventilators that the sickest patients need and a simple ambulatory bag that can be used as a temporary measure to quickly squeeze air into the lungs. The team didn’t want to interfere with the production of the more critical ventilators, so the VITAL ventilator is meant for the patients who still need breathing support but are not in the most dire conditions. It’s a temporary tool designed to last just three to four months in a hospital.

VITAL is tailored specifically for people with COVID-19, which helped to guide its design. “It’s pared down in all the things that it can do, to just retain those functions needed for COVID-19 patients,” says Van Buren.

Throughout January and February, Van Buren had been following the news about the spread of COVID-19 in China with growing concern. Pandemics have been on his mind ever since the outbreak of H1N1 in 2009 when his daughter had to be hospitalized because of the new flu strain.

When it became clear in early March that there was community spread of COVID-19 in Washington and California, Van Buren really started focusing on what he could do to help. Early models suggested that hospitals would not have enough capacity or equipment to handle the influx of COVID-19 patients. Van Buren figured JPL could be an asset in the fight. One day, he bumped into Rob Manning, JPL’s chief engineer, in the center’s cafeteria, and they started talking about what they could do. “We both had been thinking, given the circumstances, maybe the projects that we were spending our time on might not be the most important things we could be doing, given what we both recognized was about to happen,” Van Buren says.

“We more or less applied the pattern we apply when we build an instrument to land on Mars.”

Manning found money to form a small team, and the project kicked off on March 16th. The group contacted a pulmonologist named Michael Gurevitch who’s been working on ventilators for decades. He came in and told the team the exact requirements that were needed for ventilators, while a JPL employee took detailed notes on a giant whiteboard.

“We more or less applied the pattern we apply when we build an instrument to land on Mars and, say, drill through the surface and take measurements of what’s down below,” says Van Buren. “We engage with scientists. In this case, we engaged with the clinicians as to what exactly is needed, so that we can then engineer an instrument — or in this case, a ventilator.”

Eventually, other people at JPL joined the project, including Michelle Easter. Normally, she works on mechanisms known as actuators. These motors are used to deploy or rotate instruments like solar panels during a mission.

“Actuators are often a combination of mechanisms and electronics,” Easter tells The Verge. “And that’s exactly what the VITAL device is; it’s a mechanism that’s controlled by embedded electronics, and that type of design is something super comfortable for me.”

To make VITAL, the team tried to use as many common, off-the-shelf parts as possible, such as tubing, motors, valves, and electronics displays. That way, anyone manufacturing the device in the future wouldn’t need to special order anything needed for a more sophisticated ventilator. The team found that companies and vendors were eager to help provide supplies that could be scalable. And when they didn’t have what JPL needed, they gave them references.

“Companies were just opening up their Rolodexes and giving us the names of their competitors.”

“Companies were just opening up their Rolodexes and giving us the names of their competitors,” says Easter, “which is not what you think for a business mindset. But people threw all of the traditional competition out the window.”

Eventually, the team settled on the final VITAL design. Because the machine is tailored for COVID-19 patients, it’s focused on providing air delicately to stiff lungs — a hallmark symptom of the virus. Stiff lungs have a harder time expanding, so patients struggle to get enough air to breathe. VITAL is meant to provide enough air pressure to patients to inflate their lungs but not so much so that the lungs over-expand. The machine also works to ensure the lungs don’t completely deflate, either. COVID-19 patients have lung damage that makes the sides of their lungs inflamed and sticky. If all the air goes out of their lungs and the sides touch each other, they might stick together and make it even harder to open back up again. So VITAL tries to keep the lungs slightly inflated whenever patients exhale.

Now that the team has a working prototype, they’ve moved on to environmental testing with the device. Whenever NASA sends a spacecraft to another world, each vehicle must be subjected to extreme conditions — such as wide-ranging temperatures, intense vibrations, loud sounds, and more — to see if it can withstand the harsh environment of space. Many of those same tests are needed to qualify medical equipment, too, and JPL has the facilities to run them, including a giant vacuum chamber and setups to shake hardware rigorously.

“We build spacecraft not medical devices, but there are so many similar elements, because they both have to be extremely high reliability systems — for different reasons,” says Easter. “For spacecraft, once you put it up in space, you will never be able to go and fix it. So we have to verify that it’s absolutely perfect and works exactly as we expect in all conditions. Then, of course, for the medical devices, we’re connecting this to a human; we have to verify that we’re not going to hurt a person. They’re both very, very important.”

Since the Food and Drug Administration is encouraging organizations to create new devices quickly to combat COVID-19, many of the tests usually required to certify equipment are no longer needed. But JPL still has to do elevation testing with VITAL to see if the machine will work in places like Denver, for instance. They also need to do electromagnetic interference testing, which will determine if VITAL can operate normally if someone is, say, talking on a cellphone nearby.

“We build spacecraft not medical devices, but there are so many similar elements.”

On April 30th, JPL received word from the FDA that VITAL will receive an emergency use authorization. Now that they have approval, the team will send the design off to companies that can produce VITAL en masse and deliver the ventilators to hospitals in need. “We don’t do production,” says Van Buren. “We do make one or two of a kind, and we send them off to Mars or Saturn or somewhere. And so we have engaged a couple of companies to help us understand the mass production aspects.”

It’s unclear how the team will proceed when the VITAL ventilator is shipped out into the world. Many of the people on the team put their normal projects on pause to get this ventilator ready as soon as possible. They’ll likely go back to designing interplanetary space probes very soon, but they’ve been buoyed by their brief stint in the medical world.

“I think everybody on the team is just so grateful that we have something positive to contribute in our brainpower and our teamwork,” says Easter. “It definitely helps us to feel empowered in an otherwise powerless kind of situation.”

Update April 30th, 6:30PM ET: This article was updated to indicate that the VITAL ventilator had received emergency use authorization from the FDA.",1
1148,1148,1415,Atlantic beach towns brace for summer vacationers – but know it won't be the same,"After a stressful year, Terri Senter couldn't bemore ready for a beach vacation. But the coronavirus has thwarted her plans at every turn.

Senter and her husband, Gene, booked a trip from home in Indianapolis to Daytona Beach, Florida, for early May. When the chances of the city reopening by that pointseemed remote, she rebooked for June 15, assuming the pandemic would have played out by then. Now with that date a few weeks away, she figures there's still a heightened chance of contracting COVID-19. That's a risk she's unwilling to take as caregiver to her 90-year-old mother.

""I keep trying to tell myself so many people have it way worse off than we do,"" said Senter, who worries she may lose the $1,000 in reservations she has plunked down already. ""But that doesn't discount my feelings. I am disappointed.""

Other families are facing the same tough decisions about their vacations this year.

A visit to the Eastern shore is a rite of summer for many. From Maine to Florida, Atlantic beach towns attract visitors ready to frolic in the waves, savor fries or frozen custard on the boardwalk or simply soak up rays under a beach umbrella.

But this year, fears of the coronavirus are throwing plans by the wayside. Those who considered the annual trek to East Coast beaches as fundamental as visiting family at Thanksgiving are being forced to reconsider.

The fears go beyond simply a higher risk of catching the virus. Inconsistent policies by states and communities are making it hard to plan as local officials decide how to best try to salvage economies while emerging from strict stay-at-home orders.

Policies vary widely in some states, a hodgepodge of rules from one beach town to the next. In others, the states have rules in place that impede summer visitors.

In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Scarborough and East Matunuck beaches would be the first to welcome beachgoers. But there will be restrictions. The number of parking spaces will be significantly reduced, bathrooms and concession stands will be closed, and there will be no lifeguards.

In Middletown, Rhode Island, the town administrator said details on how to handle summer beach visitors were still being worked out. ""Each beach is different, and the town council needs to decide what's best for Middletown,"" Shawn Brown said in an email.

Tourism-related businesses have been stymied by a policy of requiring out-of-staters to self-quarantine for 14 days.

“I’m hoping it’s the first week of June that the quarantine is lifted, but by July 1 at the latest,” said Walter Andrews, general manager of the Newport Marriott, the largest hotel in Newport, Rhode Island. “It’s crucial we have a date. I can’t make a move without direction from the state.”

New York state beaches will reopen the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. In announcing the reopening, the state joins New Jersey, Delaware and Connecticut.

But expect to find new rules at any beach. Those flocking to Cocoa Beach, Florida, must not gather in groups of more than five and must stay at least 6 feet from other groups. Violators face potential $500 fines. Wrightsville Beach in North Carolina has limited groups to 10 and doesn't allow sunbathing or just sitting – only ""non-stationary exercise activities"" like walking, jogging, swimming and surfing/water sports.

As summer nears, the restrictions could ease and the crowds will follow, beach town locals predict.

""People are tired of being cooped up in the house, and once the governor gives that OK, it's going to get crowded again,"" said Devon Byrd, who lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

But if COVID-19 cases start to increase, the rules – and perhaps new ones – could be reimposed. Against that backdrop of uncertainty, families are having to lay bets about whether try to attempt their usual vacations.

Scott Kessler of Stuarts Draft, Virginia, and his family typically visit Virginia Beach several times a year. They stay at the Best Western Sandcastle on 13th Street. They always eat at Captain George’s Seafood Restaurant. They schedule their trips for August or September so they can attend an Old Dominion University football game.

This year, the plan was to go Sept. 4 to watch Old Dominion University play Wake Forest University, and then make a weekend of it by getting in some beach time. Facing COVID-19, Kessler is uncertain if that will happen.

“We're likely going to wait to see what happens to the virus before we make any concrete plans,” Kessler said.

He’s hoping conditions are better later in the summer. Even if he can go, he knows it won't be the same.

Kessler said they probably won’t eat at Captain George’s. They’ll still likely take a swim in the ocean, but do so while practicing social distancing.

Going to a crowded football game is a concern, but if the family goes, Kessler said they’ll wear face masks.

Amie Michael of Mount Sidney, Virginia, usually goes with her family to Virginia Beach shortly after school is out for the year. She’s a teacher and with one child still in high school and another in college, it’s an end-of-school-year celebration. They're waiting to see what happens.

“It has been booked for months,” she said. “We are still hoping to go but will cancel if the beach doesn't open.”

If they do go, dining and activities around towns could be challenges. Even though popular Rehoboth Beach in Delaware's boardwalk and beach have reopened, bars and restaurants are still takeout only. Short-term rentals and hotels are also not yet back.

Merchants, whose fortunes depend on strong summer business, are hoping for the best. They know this will be a summer like no other – both in terms of how many customers to expect and the precautions they will need to take to keep them safe.

""I think it could be a healthy mix of apprehension and excitement,"" said Karen Sphar, executive vice president of the Southport Oak Island Area Chamber of Commerce in North Carolina. ""If you are a business owner, you are extremely excited and ready to go. You may have been limping along a little bit, but now you are looking forward to getting business back into your establishment.""

Vacationers may want to isolate themselves in beach shacks or seaside apartments that they can treat as their own homes with less worry about the coronavirus left behind by past guests. They will be encouraged to shun crowds.

""People want to get away and have a safe vacation,"" said Isaac Baker, marketing director for Treasure Realty in Topsail Beach, North Carolina. ""There's no better place to be than in the sunshine on the beach.""

The decline was more stark than economists expected. The median estimate compiled by Bloomberg expected a 12% drop.

It marks the measure's second straight record contraction, after it fell 8.3% in March. At the time, that was the worst drop in the series, which began in 1992.

US retail spending declined by a record amount in April for the second straight month. The contraction comes as the widespread coronavirus lockdown freezes economic activity and consumer spending.

Retail sales plunged 16.4% in April, according to a Friday report from the Commerce Department. The decline was more stark than economists expected. The median estimate compiled by Bloomberg was for a 12% drop.

It marks the measure's second straight record drop after it fell 8.3% in March. At the time, that was the worst drop in the series, which began in 1992.

The April data shows a fuller extent of government shutdowns designed to contain the coronavirus, compared to the partial impact seen in March. Consumers slowed their spending even further as job losses persisted, sending the unemployment rate to highs not seen since the Great Depression.

Spending decreased in all but one major category: nonstore retailers. The group, which includes Amazon, saw an 8.4% jump for the month. On the flip side, a 78.8% drop at clothing stores led declines, following by a 60.6% decline in electronics and appliances stores.

Food and beverages stores fell 13.1% in April, following a 25.6% jump in March as consumer stocked up. Food services and drinking places also slumped 29.5% during the month.

The plunge has invigorated fears that US gross domestic product will experience a sharp drop in the second quarter. Retail sales account for more than 40% of consumer spending, which in turn is around 70% of US GDP.

""The 23% cumulative fall in retail sales over the last two months this alone is enough to knock more than 6 percentage points off the level of nominal GDP,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, in a Friday note.

1023,1023,1219,Retailers in the UK should adjust to these 3 realities before reopening their stores post lockdown,"Retailers in the UK should be looking to build customer confidence before reopening their stores while navigating through the Covid-19 pandemic, a survey has found.

More than a third of consumers have stopped visiting shops except for essential items, retail-technology startup Qudini's survey showed.

Based on consumer preferences for virtual services, the survey found that retailers in the UK should adjust to 3 new realities before they can reopen safely.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

While UK retailers anxiously await news from the government to restart business, they will have to consider 3 realities before opening doors once again, according to a survey by retail-technology startup, Qudini.

""The government is grappling with how to reopen stores in a secure way that protects the public, but if more stores reopen, this could lead to excessive queues outside of stores that could risk public safety,"" Imogen Wethered, chief executive of Qudini, told Business Insider.

""Queues were an iconic consequence of World War II rationing schemes, but with the smartphone technology now available to us three-quarters of a century later, it feels unnecessary that they should become an iconic part of the Coronavirus pandemic,"" she said.

Qudini's survey was conducted in March after the UK lockdown was enforced and took into account over 2,000 UK consumers aged between 16 and 90 to understand how retailers can navigate the Covid-19 landscape.

Here are 3 realities retailers should consider before they can be ready to safely reopen stores, as per findings from the survey:

1. Pre-booking visits and managing virtual queues

Owing to a strong demand for virtual services by consumers who are avoiding shop visits, retailers should look to build customer confidence in enabling store visits. Qudini found that about 50% of consumers would prefer 'essential' retailers (banks, pharmacies, and groceries) to provide virtual services over the phone.

60% of UK consumers reduced their visits to grocery stores. Qudini

Enhancing customer management processes would be key to establish effective social distancing inside and outside the store. This could be done through:

Allowing customers to pre-book their visits online

their visits online Managing walk-in customers through virtual queues (updates via text messages as their turn nears)

2. Launching click-and-collect services

42% of UK consumers said they would rather turn to click-and-collect services for groceries and pharmacies. Currently, there are limited services that cater to this demand, which is why consumers don't have an option but to visit stores for essentials.

Shoppers are more likely to use click-and-collect services during Covid-19. Qudini

In the near future, investing in contactless click-and-collect services would boost customer experiences and add long-term brand value by enabling safe curbside pick-ups.

3. Enabling personalized virtual relationships

Close to half of consumers surveyed signalled a strong demand for essential retailers to provide virtual services by phone as this would reduce in-store time significantly.

Brands that wish to create more personalized relationships could consider investing in one-to-one services to engage customers online. Qudini found that based on younger consumers having an interest in video services, it is increasingly likely that this trend would last well past the coronavirus outbreak and could be a catalyst for future brand interactions.",1
251,251,326,Fact-check: Testing Lightfoot’s COVID-19 claim yields mixed results,"The U.S. still lags behind a number of other countries in the share of its population that’s been tested for COVID-19. But how do individual states within the U.S. compare with one another?

That’s a subject Mayor Lori Lightfoot raised at a news conference while highlighting the need for increased testing capacity in Illinois to respond to the outbreak.

“Illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we’re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing because of the availability,” Lightfoot said on April 7. “It’s not for lack of desire, it’s for lack of the tests themselves, the reagents, some of the other materials that we need to be able to process the tests.”

Illinois, like many states, has struggled to expand testing due to the national shortage of tests and other supplies. And while the numbers are improving, Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said the state is still falling short of the goal he set for performing 10,000 tests per day. In an interview aired on April 14, the governor said the state is now conducting almost 8,000.

But Illinois is not unique in the testing challenges it is facing, so we wondered whether the state was really as far behind as Lightfoot suggested.

In response to our inquiry, a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office acknowledged testing figures have improved somewhat from several weeks ago, but provided a March 27 report from ABC 7 that found more than half of all states had done more testing than Illinois had after accounting for population size, including neighboring Wisconsin.

Those results were based on data from March 26 — almost two weeks before the mayor made her comparison. Given how rapidly testing data are fluctuating, we decided to evaluate her claim based on more recent figures.

To do that, we turned to data from the COVID Tracking Project, a source Lightfoot’s office pointed to in a later response.

The project, which is managed and updated by volunteer journalists and scientists, gathers data from state health departments around the country and provides figures on the total number of tests conducted by both public and commercial labs.

Its database shows Lightfoot was partly right and partly wrong when she said Illinois was testing at a rate that put it behind all its neighbors as well as in the “bottom tier” nationwide.

The day Lightfoot made her claim, Illinois ranked 28 out of all 50 states for testing on a per capita basis, figures from the project show. Its ranking has improved only slightly in the time since, with the state coming in 24th as of April 14. Its current tally of just over 110,600 total tests comes out to about 8,730 tests per million residents. New York, which tops the list, has run more than 25,650 tests per million.

But Lightfoot’s Illinois comparison doesn’t hold when it comes to the states it borders. On the day she made her claim, Illinois came out slightly ahead of Wisconsin, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana and Iowa. And in the days since, its lead has continued to grow.

Given how frequently testing figures change — along with differences in the ways states report their data — that lead in the Midwest may not mean much. But it’s enough to show Lightfoot is incorrect in her assertion that Illinois is trailing the region.

Our ruling

Lightfoot said, “Illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we’re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing.”

At the time Lightfoot made her statement, Illinois did lag a majority of states nationally in terms of the share of its population that had been tested for COVID-19, according to data compiled by an independent reporting project.

But the same dataset shows Illinois tested — and continues to test — more residents per capita than the states it borders.

We rate Lightfoot’s claim Half True.

HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

174,174,236,"Maryland’s Governor, a Republican, Is Willing to Spar With Trump for Supplies","
ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Larry Hogan was annoyed. On a conference call, Mr. Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, had just learned that several South Korean companies were ready to ship more coronavirus test kits to his state. But they were stymied because the Food and Drug Administration had not yet approved their use.
“I don’t care if we have F.D.A. approval or not,” Mr. Hogan said into a speakerphone in the governor’s reception room, where he was flanked by a container of Purell and a 9 a.m. Diet Coke, with aides sitting six feet apart around a large table. “We’ve got people dying,” he said, adding, “I don’t want to wait for permission.”
Frustrated by limited support and unclear guidance from the Trump administration, governors across the country, including some Republicans, have been squaring off with the White House and striking out on their own to secure supplies. Mr. Hogan, in his second term in a very blue state, has tried to stay miles ahead of the virus’s incursion here, like several other governors — notably Jay Inslee of Washington and Mike DeWine of Ohio — whose responses have been given better marks from Americans than the president’s.
Mr. Hogan put his health department on alert in early January when he saw the virus’s deadly crawl through China. On Monday, he issued a stay-at-home order for residents, a few weeks after declaring a state of emergency when the first three cases emerged in Maryland last month.
He is also the head of the National Governors Association, charged with representing governors’ needs at the White House, where officials wish he would find it in his heart to say a few flattering words about Mr. Trump now and then. Instead he has bluntly demanded more aid from Washington, including more test kits and supplies and help shoring up state budgets.
“We’re still not satisfied” with the federal response to states’ needs, Mr. Hogan said this week.
Mr. Hogan has also found himself the de facto leader of the response in the Washington, D.C., metro area, where the disease has begun its exponential march. The governor of Virginia and the mayor of Washington — a city where the death rate is well above the national average — instantly followed his order this week, grounding around 15 million residents.
As of Thursday night, there have been at least 4,697 confirmed cases and 89 deaths in the three areas combined, about triple from a week ago. The two states and Washington have an unusually intrinsic relationship; they share a metro system and are home to thousands of federal workers who are central to the region’s work force and the functioning of federal government.
Mr. Hogan’s moves have major implications for the region. He has immediately hit those defiantly socializing with some of the largest fines or criminal charges in the nation. There have already been two arrests in Maryland, including of a man who hosted a bonfire party for about 60 people after the state banned large groups.
His aggressive policing is one of several reasons Mr. Hogan has slid onto center stage among governors whose states have been hammered by the coronavirus.
This week, he collaborated with a Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, on an opinion piece pleading for federal assistance — after President Trump attacked her as “that woman.” He has been a critic of the president’s overly optimistic prognostications, saying Mr. Trump’s assurances that testing problems were a thing of the past were simply not true.
For Mr. Hogan, the need to respond quickly is also personal. He is a recent cancer survivor and over 60, which puts him in a high-risk group for the virus. His preparation for this moment, he said, was seeded in the 2015 Baltimore riots, which happened 90 days into his first term.
“I knew that taking quick decisive action was better than hesitating,” he said in a (socially distant) interview in his office on Wednesday. “I think the public was not where I was on the knowledge. There were folks saying this is no big deal, it’s not as bad as the flu, it’s going to disappear. And I was saying, ‘No, it’s worse.’”
Some Democrats in Maryland have praised him for his aggressive response.“Look, I’m a Democrat,” said Mary Pat Clarke, a city councilwoman from Baltimore. “But the governor has done an excellent job leading the state of Maryland through the Covid-19 state of our lives. He has been regular, he has been firm, he has been clear.”
With an eye on the virus’s rampage of China, Mr. Hogan convened a special session during the governors’ meeting in February. They met with top health officials, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, right before the governors ran to put on formal wear for a White House dinner.
“Very little was being talked about,” Mr. Hogan said. “It was sort of an eye-opener for a lot of the governors, but I think some of them still didn’t take it seriously.”
He, however, began to feel something akin to panic.“The next day I came back to my team and said, ‘This is what I just heard, we have to get ready,’” he said. “We knew that it wasn’t going to be long before we were going to have to deal with it.”
Mr. Hogan has also leaned on his wife, Yumi Hogan, a Korean immigrant, who was also at the governor’s convention, which included a dinner at the Korean ambassador’s home. As the first Korean first lady in American history, Ms. Hogan has become something of an icon in South Korea. “I just grabbed my wife and said, ‘Look, you speak Korean. You know the president. You know the first lady. You know the ambassador. Let’s talk to them in Korean, and tell them we need their help.’” Several companies in South Korea immediately said they would send tests.
Mr. Hogan’s super-cop moves have not endeared him to some conservatives who largely populate the more southern and rural parts of the state.
“I think the bubble the Governor is in is missing something,” Gregory Kline, a longtime conservative activist in the state, said on Twitter. “There was no acknowledgment that his directions were doing harm to people greater than this disease would do or even that suffering is occurring not because of the disease but the executive fiat fighting it.”
Mr. Hogan is one of the few elected Republicans in the country who have publicly countered Mr. Trump’s early claims about the state of the virus, and more crucially about the amount of tests and ventilators available to states.
“I don’t think I’ve ever crossed the line and been rude or tried to attack or point fingers or place blame. But I have been willing to stand up when other people haven’t,” he said. He added, “Certainly some of my Republican colleagues probably might think I go too far. Some of the Democratic colleagues might not think I go far enough. But I’m not trying to place blame.”
Some officials said that the state could be faster in giving basic directives and that, like Mr. Hogan, they wished they could get more protective gear. “There are not enough supplies for health care workers and essential employees,” said State Senator Jill Carter, a Democrat.
Maryland has received far fewer N95 masks, respirators and gloves than it has requested from the federal government, according to documents released on Thursday by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. And it has received none of the 100,000 swabs it requested for coronavirus test kits.
Mr. Hogan said his decisions were informed principally by health care professionals, many of them culled from the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, among other local health care providers.
“I’m not an expert on this, but I’m going to listen to the smartest guys in the room,” he said, adding: “These guys say if we don’t act now, we’re going to have this surge, we’re not going to have ventilators, we’re going to overload the system. We’re not going to have enough health care workers, we’re going to look like New York, and there’s going to be bodies stacked up.”
Every day, there are dozens of decisions to be made over conference calls. Pay some state workers extra who have been called upon to report to work when most other Marylanders are being asked to remain home? Yes. How about for workers who check on child abuse reports? Also yes. Palm Sunday services permitted in church parking lots? Yes, but no passing of a collection plate. This debate went on for some time. “We don’t like government telling churches what to do,” Mr. Hogan said, “but we don’t want 2 million people to die.”",1

Massachusetts, praised by public health officials for being one of the first states to set up a coronavirus contact tracing program, is running into a problem: people aren’t picking up their phones.

When investigators reached out to infected residents and those with whom they came into close contact, more than half of their calls were being ignored, health officials revealed in recent a press briefing with Gov. Charlie Baker.

“If you get a call or a text from your local board of health or the COVID Team, it’s vital you take that call,” Baker said at the May 7 news conference, though state officials said the numbers have since improved.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said her state has faced the same problem.

""I know a lot of you don't answer the phone when you see an unknown caller reaching in, but I implore you to answer the call if it comes,"" she said at an April 20 news conference.

Experts have long said that along with robust coronavirus testing, contact tracing -- the detective work of searching backward from a positive coronavirus case for everyone who might've been exposed to it -- on a massive scale is key to a safer reopening of the country.

Starting with people who test positive for COVID-19, tracers, with a series of carefully worded questions, figure out who a person was in contact with a few days before their symptoms started – skillfully reconstructing their schedules from sometimes hazy memories to map out a detailed chain of potential COVID-19 transmission.

They then follow up with that person's close contacts, alerting those who may have been exposed to COVID-19, all without ever revealing the identity of patient zero.

But across the country, the growing number of coronavirus contact tracers are struggling to reach some residents who may have been exposed and, therefore, could be spreading the disease, public health officials in several states told ABC News.

While it’s not clear how many Americans are ignoring contact tracing calls – a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson said the agency is not gathering data on the subject from the states – any spike in missed connections could delay efforts to quickly notify people and limit the spread of the virus in communities beginning to loosen restrictions, public health officials and experts told ABC News.

“When you miss anyone, and your contact tracing is incomplete, then you are at risk of ongoing transmission,” said Capt. Eric Pevzner, the chief of the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, the country’s premier public health investigation program.

In interviews with ABC News, health officials offered a variety of explanations for why people aren’t answering phone calls from contact tracers, from robocall fatigue to concerns over privacy to a general mistrust of the system.

“It’s a trend we need to watch,” said Dr. Crystal Watson, a senior associate at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in light of the “truly unprecedented” scale of contact tracing being done.

“It’s going to take a really impressive amount of cooperation and buy-in from the public to do this,” she said.

A consequence of endless robocalls

At a time when Americans are bombarded with more than 58 billion robocalls a year, and fraudsters are using the coronavirus to target potential victims in phone calls and text messages, many people are reluctant to field unexpected calls from unknown numbers.

“We’re hearing more and more from local health departments that have ramped up contact tracing, if citizens, if community members are seeing the Health Department on their phone, they’re really reluctant to provide information,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, which represents nearly 3,000 local health departments across the country.

Before the coronavirus pandemic, local health officials performing contact tracing to track down food-borne illness and sexually transmitted disease outbreaks would be responsible for placing calls.

But with many states partnering with private companies and nonprofits to expand their coronavirus contact tracing efforts, some calls are being made from numbers that trace back to local health departments -- meaning the people who may already have been reluctant to answer are more likely to assume it's a robocall, a telemarketer or some other kind of sales pitch.

“We’re in a time in the United States when there’s a ton of spam phone calls,” John Welch of Partners in Health, the nonprofit working with the state on their contact tracing program, said at the press conference with Baker last week. “If they are worried about a scam, have folks call us back.”

To address the problem, Massachusetts is working with telephone companies to make sure their contact tracers are identified as “MA COVID TEAM” on any call in hopes the more official-sounding identification will convince people the call is legitimate.

The state has also launched a public service announcement campaign to promote the effort help residents understand what to expect from a potential phone call.

State health officials told ABC News Friday the outreach, along with some new tracing communication strategies, has recently brought their ""connection rates"" to above 60%, including 67.9% for May 11. The officials said that through the middle of the week, the state's effort has reached more than 34,000 people -- 18,936 confirmed cases and 15,889 of their contacts.

Some communities wary of giving health investigators personal info

But even if the recipient recognizes a legitimate government entity, sometimes that's a problem too. In some communities, contact-tracing response rates also appear to reflect larger concerns about what health authorities could do with the information they're given.

“In general, people are wary of sharing personal information with strangers or with people from government,” said Dr. Richard Besser, the president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the CDC.

“Many of the groups that are being hardest hit -- black Americans, Latinos, Native Americans -- have had poor experiences with government officials and many have had poor experience with public health,” said Besser, who also previously served as chief health and medical editor for ABC News.

Freeman, who is in contact with hundreds of counties conducting contact tracing each day, said that communities with large immigrant populations have struggled in some cases to reach undocumented immigrants who have come in contact with people infected with COVID-19.

“Because of some of the fear created already in our country around immigration and legal status, there are some we simply will never reach because they’re fearful that the information will be used to somehow track them"" by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, she told ABC News.

In Maryland’s Anne Arundel County outside of Baltimore, public health workers have made community outreach a priority in their contact tracing by adding translators to their staff, and making sure all their informational handouts are available in Spanish.

The county has also increased outreach to African-American and Hispanic community leaders, to help encourage residents to participate, according to Jennifer Schneider, the deputy director of the health department’s bureau of disease prevention and management.

“There is some mistrust, and we battle with that in public health in general, for the communities to trust the government,” she said. “Immigration status is not a requirement for being tested. We just try to get that messaging out as much as we can and often.”

While the county, which has over 2,500 cases of COVID-19, says it has reached roughly 95% of traced contacts, Schneider said they are concerned about that figure rising as the state begins to ease out of its lock-down, and residents begin interacting with more people.

“We may have to pivot our operations to better find those individuals. That is a concern that we do have,” she said.

The emerging role of technology

In some parts of the country, local public health officials are using technology to reach residents who favor other forms of communication over phone calls.

In Chicago, the city launched Chi COVID Coach to allow the health department to communicate directly with Chicago residents via text message, and provide them with resources on testing and symptoms.

“Let’s not make the choice between tech and people, we need both,” Raed Mansour, Director of Innovation at the Chicago Department of Public Health, told ABC News. “In contact tracing, you need to meet people where they are.”

In many places, that has included text messaging for those who are less likely to answer calls.

""Texting is another way we are letting people know they are trying to reach them,"" Pevznar, the CDC official, told ABC News.""We find people tend to be more receptive to text. Text is a valuable tool.""

Perhaps most importantly, however, experts also urged for a more robust public awareness campaign to encourage people to participate.

That effort could help address problems some tracers have faced when they finally do successfully get in touch with people.

One of the newer unexpected problems some tracers are seeing is nearly an existential one: a lost sense of time.

Some people have struggled to piece together their schedules, after weeks of stay-at-home orders in certain regions, public health officials told ABC News.

Since your life has been disrupted, you don’t have those things to pin your memory to. People’s days tend to blend together,” said Pevznar.

Then, there are those who make contact tracing exponentially difficult by flouting quarantine measures. Sara Bosse, the health director in California’s rural Madera County, said that her team has checked in on asymptomatic residents infected with COVID-19 who have stopped complying with stay-at-home restrictions.

“As the weather has gotten warmer, we’ve noticed that people want to be outside and go places and do things,” she told ABC News.

Dr. Philip Huang, the director of the Health and Human Services department in Dallas County, Texas, said it's important to get people to understand why they need to isolate and self-quarantine if contacted, even if they don't have symptoms.

""People need to be responsible. It’s actually caring for the community and caring for others – it may be someone's mother or someone’s grandmother,"" he said. ""It does affect us all.""

8:57 p.m. DePaul, Loyola releases plans for fall semester

As coronavirus cases continue to increase statewide, two Chicago universities are planning to have students on campus this fall.

DePaul University and Loyola University of Chicago have consulted with public health experts and state and local officials to devise their plans for the fall semester.

DePaul expects to have limited in-person learning and reduced occupancy in the dorms this fall. Meanwhile, Loyola hopes to offer both on-campus and online classes.

Both universities said they’ll share more details about the fall semester in the coming weeks.

Loyola also announced its “Loyola Commitment,” a new financial aid program, funded by the university and its donors, which will help students who have been affected by the economic downturn amid the pandemic.

“As unemployment rises along with uncertainty about our economic outlook, we will see a sharp increase in students and families whose plans about attending Loyola might be hindered. Dreams are being crushed by diminished family finances,” Loyola provost Norberto Grzywacz wrote in an email to students. “The scale of this crisis and its financial impact on families will have a profound effect on many students from various backgrounds. In particular, it is expected to impact enrollment and our desire for a vibrant and diverse community as a place of growth, experience, and opportunity.”

8:13 p.m. Work-from-home Congress: House OKs proxy voting for first time

WASHINGTON — Neither Civil War nor Great Depression nor any other national crisis has pushed the House to allow lawmakers to vote by proxy — without being “present,” as the Constitution requires. That’s about to change during the coronavirus pandemic.

The House approved Friday a package of historic rules changes so Congress can keep functioning even while it’s partly closed. The shift will dramatically change the look, if not the operation, of the legislative branch — launching a 21st century WFH House, like others, “working from home.”

“This House must continue legislating,” Rep. Jim McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said during a lengthy session ahead of the vote. “And we have to do so in a way that is safe for all those around us.”

Debate over the changes has been fierce. As President Donald Trump encourages Americans back to work, the 435-member House has stayed away due to health risks while the smaller Senate has resumed operations.

7:34 p.m. White Sox’ Eloy Jimenez says thank you with gifts for mask-making shop in Little Village

White Sox outfielder Eloy Jiménez honored a good cause with a good deed.

In a show of gratitude to a local bridal shop, Novias Davila in Little Village, Jimenez donated official Sox uniforms and funds to the shop, which is making face masks needed for the community during the coronavirus pandemic.

Shop owner Tania Hernández received a video message from Jiménez on Friday, thanking her team for their commitment to the community. Jimenez gave each of seven workers a $500 Jewel-Osco gift card and $500 in cash to provide support during this time.

The Little Village area had the most confirmed coronavirus cases of any single ZIP code in the state as of May 6. Jiménez asked that the face masks are donated to first responders in the neighborhood.

Former Chicago Ald. Ambrosio Medrano, convicted three times in corruption scandals, left prison this week as part of an effort to release inmates who are at-risk of contracting the coronavirus.

Federal Bureau of Prisons records show Medrano has been assigned to a residential re-entry management office in the Chicago area. Gal Pissetzky, the attorney who defended Medrano when he was sentenced in federal court six years ago, said Medrano is in a halfway house.

But for the rest of Medrano’s sentence, Pissetzky said, “he’s going to be on home confinement.” Medrano’s official release date isn’t until Sept. 14, 2025, prison records show.

It’s Angela Conners Treimer’s job to take photos of the most beautiful places on Earth.

As a commercial resort photographer, she travels over 100,000 miles each year, capturing luxurious images in places like Cabo and the Maldives.

So when the coronavirus started to spread and travel bans went into effect, Treimer was furloughed — for three months at least, and maybe longer.

“For the first time in three years, I wasn’t living on an airplane, you know? Whenever we were advised by the CDC to not travel, my world kind of flipped upside down,” she said. “I just started brainstorming: What am I going to do for the next three months? This is the first time in my life that I haven’t had a 9 to 5.”

Searching for normalcy and human connection, she decided to look for beauty elsewhere.

That’s how her project, “Stories from Six Feet,” came to be.

“Stories from Six Feet” is a photo series that documents the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting Chicago through the eyes of its residents in isolation. The project lives on Instagram under the handle @StoriesFromSixFeet.

It’s unclear when Chicago’s 81 libraries will reopen, but staff are returning to their jobs Wednesday to prepare for the day when doors will be flung open and patrons will be welcomed back.

“Absolutely no date has been set to open libraries to the public, and any reopening decision would be consistent with public health guidance and dependent on where our data is at that time,” Jordan Troy, a spokesman for Mayor Lightfoot, said in an email Friday.

“As the mayor has stated since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, every decision made in city government will be guided by science and data.”

Libraries have been closed since March 21.

3:15 p.m. President Trump still confident in Abbott’s virus test despite false negatives

Trump expressed his confidence in the test from Abbott Laboratories after a preliminary study by New York University researchers reported problems with it. Trump and his deputies have have promoting the 15-minute test as a “game changer.”

The Food and Drug Administration announced late Thursday it was investigating preliminary data suggesting the Abbott test can miss COVID-19 cases, falsely clearing infected patients.

“Abbott is a great test; it’s a very quick test,” Trump said at a Rose Garden event to highlight his administration’s efforts to develop a vaccine for the virus. “And it can always be very rapidly double checked.”

The test is used daily at the White House to test Trump, key members of his staff as well as any visitor to the White House complex who comes in close proximity to the president or Vice President Mike Pence.

2:45 p.m. Coronavirus now in 100 Illinois counties as state tops 4K deaths, 90K cases

COVID-19 is now in 100 of Illinois’ 102 counties, as Friday marked the fourth day in a row that the state has seen more than 100 lives lost — and the 18th such day since the pandemic began.

With the latest 130 deaths, the state has lost 1,727 people so far in May, and 4,058 overall.

There were also 2,432 more people testing positive among the latest batch of 26,565 test results, officials said. And Edgar County became the 100th county to record positive cases in the state.

There have been 90,369 confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic began.

The state’s overall positivity rate — the number of positive cases compared to total tests received — was 9.1%. And the Northeast region, home to Chicago, Cook and the collar counties, remained under 20%, a benchmark set for further to enter the next phase of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s regional reopening plan.

2:36 p.m. Cook County surpasses Queens, NY, as county with most COVID-19 cases in U.S.

Cook County has surpassed Queens County in New York as the U.S. county with the most coronavirus cases based on Sun-Times analysis of the latest public data.

There have been 58,457 total cases of COVID-19 recorded in Cook County, which includes all of Chicago and many of its suburbs, after officials added 2,051 new cases in the last 24 hours. Queens, by comparison, added only 336 cases over the same time frame to bring its total to 58,084.

Cook County still has a lower rate of COVID-19 per capita given its population (5.1 million) is more than twice as large as Queens (2.25 million). But Queens also has a much higher population density with 20,500 people per square mile compared to 5,500 per square mile in Cook County, which can make social distancing measures more challenging to maintain.

1:55 p.m. Lightfoot hints at street closures to help restaurants

Is Mayor Lori Lightfoot planning to close streets and sidewalks so restaurants can safely reopen and give residents a place to run, walk and play? Sure sounds like it.

“People are itching to get outside. Businesses are looking at creative ways to serve customers. The key is how we do it,” the mayor tweeted Friday.

“Stay tuned for some changes to our streets and sidewalks. Transportation is more than just cars. We’ll show how Chicago can be safer and easier to get around.”

Last week, Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia urged Gov. J.B. Pritzker to relax his five-step plan to reopen Illinois by allowing restaurants to open at 25% of capacity beginning June 1 with strict safeguards for restaurant employees, including face masks and daily temperature checks.

At the time, Toia teased the street closing idea.

1:27 p.m. Lightfoot warns religious leaders she is prepared to enforce stay-at-home order

Mayor Lori Lightfoot has appealed to religious leaders to not defy Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order — and warned she is prepared to “enforce the rules” if they don’t.

In a “Dear Members of the Chicago Faith Community” letter sent Thursday, Lightfoot urged religious leaders to continue holding virtual services rather than in-person services, where it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain social distance.

“I am urging you to stay the course. If there is a problem, I would rather be in conversation than in conflict. But to be clear, I am resolute that I must enforce the rules of the governor’s stay-at-home order. To be fair to all, I simply cannot look away from non-compliance, no matter the source or the intention,” she wrote.

On Monday, Lightfoot responded to Sunday service defiance by saying she hoped to educate religious leaders into compliance, avoiding mass arrests.

“We’re not gonna send in the police to arrest parishioners. People are exercising their faith, and I understand that,” she said then.

But the next day, the mayor made it clear she was serious about enforcing the governor’s order and she would do what she must.

12:59 p.m. Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts not sure baseball will be played this season: report

Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts told season-ticket holders he is not sure baseball will be played this year.

According to a story published by The Athletic, Ricketts said the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, conflicts over the best time to reopen businesses, and continuing negotiations between the owners and players could combine to prevent the start of the season.

“I don’t think anyone can answer that question just yet,” Ricketts said during a virtual forum with season-ticket holders Thursday. “The current thinking and the current discussions (among owners) have been all around trying to get back into our home ballparks for this season. Obviously, without fans. Now that creates three specific problems that we have to address.”

The team has been consulting with health professionals on the best way to make Wrigley Field safe, according to a recording of Cubs president Crane Kenney obtained by The Athletic.

12:26 p.m. The high cost of quarantine

In a letter to the Sun-Times editors, Tom Gregg of Niles writes:

Before the quarantine, I was visiting my 99-year-old mother twice a day in our retirement home, and she was holding her own in terms of her health. She is vision-impaired, hearing-impaired, arthritic and suffering from mild dementia, certainly, but for 13 years in two homes she had largely been able to avoid hospital stays for life-threatening problems. Plus, her interaction with me seemed to greatly help in minimizing her spells of confusion.

But now, during our relatively brief period of enforced separation — I live on a lower floor while she lives up on an assisted living floor — she has contracted pneumonia, for which she has been in and out of hospital, and her spells of confusion seem to be worsening. Symptomatic, doubtless, of the unprecedented disorientation.

My mother remains among the living today, but for how long if she remains so isolated? Now multiply this single case by all the other seniors around the country who have seen their precious interactive routines disappear. It is a situation that many of them, given their cognitive limitations, have difficulty grasping.

This potentially lethal hardship is worth noting when we are formulating pandemic recovery plans. The cure of the quarantine shouldn’t cost more than the contagion itself, should it?

11:44 a.m. What’s the first meal you’ll want at a restaurant post-pandemic? We asked, Chicagoans answered.

With eat-in dining at restaurants on hold because of the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order, the next time you’ll be waited on at a restaurant probably won’t be for a while.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s five-phase plan for reopening Illinois businesses puts restaurant reopenings in Phase 4. We’re now in Phase 2.

So with Chicagoans craving a meal out, we asked: Once restaurants reopen for dining in, what’s the first meal you’ll want to eat out, and from where? Some of these answers have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

10:08 a.m. How we should honor our youngest COVID-19 victim

Ernesto Guzman, age 12, suffered from asthma and obstructive sleep apnea, two other underlying health problems with potentially serious consequences that have figured into many other COVID-19 deaths, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office.

But make no mistake, doctors say it was the coronavirus that caused the pneumonia that took Ernesto’s life early Thursday morning at Advocate Christ Medical Center, Oak Lawn.

Because his death occurred after midnight, it is not yet counted among the 3,928 official COVID-19 deaths in Illinois, but it was listed among the single-day record high of 126 deaths reported Thursday from Cook County by the medical examiner.

Will the death of a 12-year-old boy cause more people to take this disease seriously? Mark Brown says he doubts it. But he hopes that will change.

“Take this seriously, folks,” he wrote. “Take it very seriously, because the life you risk may not be your own.”

8:49 a.m. Abbott rapid COVID-19 test may yield false negatives, FDA warns

The federal Food and Drug Administration issued a warning Thursday night that early data suggests Abbott Laboratories’ rapid coronavirus test, touted by the Trump administration as a game changer, may return inaccurate and false negative results — findings the Chicago-area firm vehemently denied.

The Abbott ID NOW test — which can provide results in minutes — is used by the White House to quickly test anyone who comes into proximity of President Donald Trump. Trump has lavished attention on the Abbott ID NOW test and featured it at a White House event three days after the FDA fast-tracked its approval by granting an emergency use authorization on March 27.

In just a few weeks time, Abbott has shipped 1.8 million of the ID NOW tests, which is used at several Chicago-area testing sites.

The FDA warning came a day after a New York University preliminary study raised questions about its accuracy. The study was not subject to peer review, a process that checks on the procedures used for a study as well as its findings.

7:03 a.m. ‘Grandstanding’ by Grand Old Party? Or is Pritzker masking his decisions?

SPRINGFIELD — After weeks of nudges from Republican legislators, the General Assembly is planning to return to Springfield to get back to work.

And as they prepare for the Legislature’s long-sought session next week, Republicans said Thursday they are willing to comply with safety guidelines issued by the Democrats – but they want an examination of their own.

GOP lawmakers said they will wear face coverings, submit to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks and follow other safety measures when they return to Springfield, but they balked at signing a pledge to follow those recommendations as requested by House Speaker Mike Madigan.

And Republicans want to put Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s “Restore Illinois” plan under the microscope with a public hearing.

GOP lawmakers have criticized Pritzker’s “Restore Illinois” plan as “arbitrary,” saying the dates in which parts of the states can begin to reopen don’t make sense, and its metrics ignore geographical differences in COVID-19’s impact.

6:45 a.m. With the focus on the coronavirus, Lightfoot opts for bare-bones capital plan

Singularly focused on the war against the coronavirus, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has opted for a $100 million, bare bones capital plan — bankrolled by an existing line of credit — to pay for new vehicles, sidewalks and the treasured aldermanic menu program.

Normally, the city issues general obligation bonds backed by property taxes to cover a more sweeping capital program. But these are not normal times.

The Lightfoot administration is preoccupied with the city’s response to the coronavirus and the budget crisis triggered by the stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy.

So the decision was made to proceed only with those capital projects and purchases that absolutely needed to get done and to finance it with a line of credit that remained, even after Lightfoot saved $22 million by eliminating a $1.4 billion line of credit negotiated by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

7:47 p.m. Everything must be on the table as city, state fight back from financial devastation

Washington to cities and states: You’re on your own.

For months, the Trump administration has failed to take the lead in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, punting responsibility to the states. Now the president and his Republican Party are looking to do the same when it comes to helping states and cities survive the pandemic’s financial devastation.

A $3 trillion stimulus package expected to be approved by the Democratic-controlled House looks dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, and President Donald Trump is making clear he would never sign such a bill.

Why? Because the package to rescue drowning cities, suburbs, states, small businesses and unemployed Americans would be fiscally imprudent, they claim.

We couldn’t disagree more. And, yes, this is the same Senate and president who rewrote the federal tax code in 2017 to give billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest one percent of Americans, ballooning the federal deficit.

So what does all this mean for Illinois and Chicago, as well as for towns and counties statewide?

6:35 p.m. Gov. Pritzker fumbles rollout of ‘Restore Illinois’

For many weeks after the beginning of this COVID-19 crisis, Gov. J.B. Pritzker proved adept at telegraphing his every move.

Pritzker waited until people practically begged him to shut down the schools on March 15. He talked about issuing a stay-at-home order for days, and then acted on March 21 only after California jumped first.

It was clear for days that he would extend his stay-at-home order another month starting April 1. He talked for well over a week about a mask-wearing requirement, always noting that he was being lobbied by Republican state Rep. Mark Batinick before finally announcing the order on April 23.

People did not always agreed with him, but they always had a sense of where he was going. Pritzker did get out over his skis when his Illinois Workers’ Compensation Commission dramatically altered the burden of proof on COVID-19 illnesses in favor of employees without so much as a heads-up to business groups. But most regular folks never noticed that and a court intervened and stopped the order anyway.

Otherwise, the governor did a remarkably good job of making sure the public was always aware in advance of his leadership direction.

And then on May 5 he announced his “Restore Illinois” roadmap to gradually reopen the state.

6:53 a.m. Chicago’s flag, civic pride and the fight against COVID-19

If Chicago were to add a fifth star to the city’s flag, an awful lot of hipsters would have to get their tattoos reworked.

Maybe it’s best we just leave the flag as it is, even if the city manages to prevail against COVID-19.

Last Friday and again on Wednesday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot floated the idea of adding a fifth red star to Chicago’s flag to mark the city’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. She was trying to rally the city. If Chicago’s effort to beat the virus is terrifically successful, she said Friday, it will “truly warrant a fifth star on our flag.”

But let’s be blunt. Chicago’s not about to be terrifically successful anytime soon. Nobody is. This is a global public health war that’s sure to be fought for years, and a lot of people are setting us up to lose.

6:10 a.m. Navy Pier is an arm of government, no matter what it claims — so let’s see every contract

Now that the nonprofit that runs Navy Pier is getting a federal stimulus loan of nearly $2.5 million, it’s really way past time that it opened its books to the public completely.

Navy Pier Inc., which leases the 104-year-old pier from the public, is a government body that masquerades as a nonprofit organization. As such, it has been allowed to hide its workings from public scrutiny while benefiting from public support.

Navy Pier Inc. pays just $1 a year to the state and city to lease the pier.

And just this week, Sun-Times reporters Tim Novak and Robert Herguth revealed that the organization, whose president is paid more than $540,000 a year, has received a nearly $2.5 million coronavirus stimulus loan from the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program.

Like all nonprofits, Navy Pier Inc. must disclose much of its finances by filing 990 forms, but it does not have to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests or disclose the terms of contracts.

“There will literally blue everywhere,” said L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti in a briefing on Thursday night, who urged people to applaud those workers, many of whom are coming back or going to long shifts. “One voice, united as a city and community, we say thank you. You are the ones who are saving our lives.”

The effort came out of the UK, the #LightItBlue volunteer effort has been organized in the U.S. by a collective of leaders from the events and entertainment industry. It was a way visualize their appreciation for what is now millions of Americans on the frontline of the crisis.

“We’ve been so inspired over the past few weeks by the cheers of our neighbors around the world – and we wanted to bring this collective gratitude to an even bigger stage here in the U.S.,” said lead organizer of the movement, Joe Zenas, CEO at Thinkwell Group, a design and production agency.

“This is a heartfelt ‘thank you’ from those of us at home to those of us who are going to work each day to keep our country going,” Zenas said.

All activations were executed using existing resources in accordance with local stay-at-home mandates. After this Thursday’s kickoff, the #LightItBlue effort will continue weekly on Thursday nights across the U.S.

486,486,597,NYC will use powerful ultraviolet lamps to kill the coronavirus on subways and buses,"New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is dealing with record-low ridership on subways and buses, is trying to shed some light on its coronavirus problem.

According to the New York Daily News, the agency will begin using powerful ultraviolet light as part of its beefed-up sanitization program on subways and buses. The effort is part of a partnership with Columbia University, which theorizes that UV light can be used to kill diseases on the transit system.

Starting May 11th, UV lamps will be placed inside subway cars and buses at two rail yards and bus depots. The lamps emit rays called “UVC,” a relatively obscure part of the spectrum that consists of a shorter, more energetic wavelength of light that can be harmful to humans if exposed directly.

The lamps emit rays called “UVC,” a relatively obscure part of the spectrum

UVC is particularly good at killing organic material — whether in humans or viral particles — but the jury is still out on whether it can be effective in destroying the novel coronavirus. UVC lamps and robots are commonly used to sanitize water, objects such as laboratory equipment, and spaces such as buses and airplanes. If the MTA results are good, transit officials said they will expand it to include more trains and buses.

“At this critical and unprecedented time, the MTA is exploring every solution scientists and the market have to offer in our effort to ensure the transportation system is safe for our customers and employees,” said Mark Dowd, MTA chief innovation officer, in a statement. “The pilot project involving this proven UV technology is another example of that as we look for alternative ways to effectively reduce risk on train cars and buses. We thank Columbia University for its partnership and are hopeful this new technology in transit provides a more effective and efficient option than our current disinfecting efforts.”

President Donald Trump infamously touted ultraviolet light and disinfectant as potential treatments for people who are sick with COVID-19, despite both being very harmful to humans. The president later claimed that he was being sarcastic.

Last week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the extraordinary step of shutting down subway service from 1AM to 5AM every evening starting on May 6th for extensive disinfecting.

The MTA has reported a 90 percent drop in ridership since the start of the pandemic, with the agency curtailing some train and bus service to address the drop in demand. Many essential workers still count on transit to get to and from work every day. So far, over 80 MTA employees have died from the virus.

""Rapid response Northwest 6. Rapid response Northwest 6. Blue zone.""

Dr. Michelle Ng Gong oversees a rapid response team of critical care doctors responding to a crashing COVID-19 patient. Gilad Thaler

Dr. Michelle Ng Gong strapped on a face shield as the sound of the Montefiore Medical Center PA system broadcasted an all-too-familiar announcement: a COVID-19 patient was in critical condition. Gong rushed out of the command center, weaved through the hallways, and dodged stretchers as she made her way toward the patient's room.

Before entering the room, Gong called for gowns, grabbed several herself and handed them out to other nurses who had just arrived. Gong was about to enter the ""red zone,"" an area where personal protective gear, or PPE, would be the only barrier between her and the virus.

The patient was on a ventilator, but his oxygen levels had fallen. Gong didn't believe he was moving his chest wall well. She wanted to attempt taking the ventilator out of the equation and manually deliver oxygen. She reached for the patient's foot.

""He's got good blood pressure, he's got a good pulse."" Gong leaped onto the patient's chest — her feet dangled in the air, her face mere inches from the patient's, as she exerted her own body weight. Gong wanted to see if the patient could stand being placed in a ""prone position"" — a process that requires several healthcare workers to rotate the patient onto the patient's stomach to help get oxygen to the back of the lungs.

Gong determined that the patient would benefit from this process, but he would first need to be transmitted to the Surgical ICU.

In normal times, gowns are discarded each time a nurse or doctor interacts with a patient to minimize contamination in ""green zones"" of the hospital. But this patient needed to get to the surgical ICU immediately.

""Please clear all corridors,"" a voice said over the PA system.

Because he had just been removed from a ventilator, there was a greater chance he would spread COVID-19 into the air. A doctor placed a translucent sheet of plastic over the patient's face, a technique used to minimize spreading the virus, and a team of four remained clad in full PPE while they wheeled the patient across multiple hallways and down an elevator bank.

While hospitalizations have gone down across New York, the patients who have been admitted are getting sicker.

Said Gong: ""These are still not normal times, and these are still very sick patients."" Despite her best efforts, this patient died later that night.

Nurse Jasmine Christakos says she will always remember the first COVID-19 death in the Surgical ICU. Christakos had just gotten married in late February and returned to work as the virus was beginning to spread rapidly.

Christakos recalled a family grieving over the fact that they could not visit, and that the patient would die alone. Christakos remembers that night, when the entire unit sat in front of the patient's room and waited for the ventilator to be pulled. ""We said a prayer, we said goodbye, and we told the family, no, they didn't die alone. They died with us.""

Many of the patients admitted to the Surgical ICU make it out. When a patient is well enough to breathe on their own, they are ""extubated,"" or removed from a ventilator, offering cause for celebration from doctors and nurses.

""Since COVID, it's been a little difficult to find the light in the darkness. But you celebrate the little victories,"" Christakos told CBS News.

While witnessing the extubation of one patient, Doctor Jen-Ting (Tina) Chen called for a nurse to ring a cowbell, signaling the good news to the rest of the floor. After an extubation a few days earlier on the same floor, a nurse wrote the time on a white-board, and drew a heart.

At the peak of the pandemic, Montefiore Hospital Center broadcasted ""Empire State of Mind"" by Alicia Keys over the PA system and Christakos has taken to dancing during the ""happy code.""

""It's an amazing experience to see someone no longer need a breathing tube. No longer need the help of a ventilator,"" Christakos said. ""I've seen patients where I was like, 'Oh my goodness are they going to make it?' And they do."" To Christakos, it is victories like these that make the work, ""so worth it, just absolutely worth it.""

Cristian Camas is one of many examples of a patient pulling through. The 22-year-old ambulance worker contracted the virus on the job. After 21 days inside Montefiore Medical Center, he was discharged. Nurses wheeled Camas through the COVID ward and out to the street. Camas squinted in the bright light of the sun as healthcare workers applauded his release.

""We're definitely winning more than we are losing. The majority of patients with COVID are still surviving. But the sheer number of patients with COVID is just unprecedented,"" said Gong. ""The emergencies continue, we continue to respond, and we take it one day at a time.""",1

5 p.m.: Texas governor sending task force to hard-hit region

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced additions to a task force being sent to Amarillo, Texas, where the governor announced 700 people have tested positive for COVID-19.

The cases appear to be tied to several meat-packing plants in the region.

Abbott announced that several plants have been shut down.

Members of the Texas Emergency Medical Task Force and Texas National Guard were sent to the area on May 5 to gather information on the booming number of cases with the results announced Saturday.

""As Texas continues ramping up its testing capabilities, there will be an increase in positive cases as the state targets the most high-risk areas: nursing homes, meat packing plants and jails,"" Abbott said in a statement. ""That is exactly why I established Surge Response Teams. By immediately deploying resources and supplies to these high risk areas, we will identify the positive cases, isolate the individuals and ensure any outbreak is quickly contained, which is the strategy being deployed in Amarillo.""

Members of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Texas Division of Emergency Management, Texas Department of State Health Services and BCFS Health and Human Services are now also responding to the area, the governor announced.

2:12 p.m.: Chartered boat services can resume in New Jersey

Fishing and watercraft rentals are set to resume in New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy announced.

The announcement comes a day after Murphy said Jersey Shore beaches would reopen.

Chartered boat services are permitted to reopen at 6 a.m. Sunday, with mandatory social distancing and sanitizing measures in place. Murphy also said that people will pay either online or over the phone to reduce in-person interactions.

Murphy said the metrics of COVID-19, including patients in hospitals, patients on ventilators and patients in the ICU, all were down in a way that showed ""we can move forward.""

The governor added that the declines were not just from peaks but ""meaningful,"" even over the past couple of weeks.

The Watkins Glen International automobile racetrack, in Schuyler County in the western part of the state, also will be allowed to reopen, Cuomo said. The governor did not provide details on what events would be held there, but like the horse racing tracks, fans will not be permitted yet.

Cuomo said he's looking to increase economic activity, including events that can operate without crowds.

Elective surgeries and ambulatory care also will be allowed to resume in Westchester County and Suffolk County. The hospitalization rate, intubations and number of new cases all continue to decline, even with 400 new hospitalizations in the state, Cuomo said.

An additional 157 people died in the last 24 hours.

11:47 a.m.: FDA authorizes 1st standalone at-home sample collection kit

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the first at-home sample collection kit for COVID-19, which can be used to send samples to specified laboratories for diagnostic testing.

The Everlywell COVID-19 Test Home Collection Kit allows a person to self-collect a nasal sample at home. It can be used by people who have been screened using on online questionnaire that is reviewed by a health care provider, the FDA said.

Additionally, the FDA authorized two COVID-19 diagnostic tests that can be used with the at-home collected samples.

Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said the development provides ""increased patient access to tests"" and ""protects others from potential exposure.""

""Today's action is also another great example of public-private partnerships in which data from a privately funded study was used by industry to support an EUA request, saving precious time as we continue our fight against this pandemic,"" Shuren said in a statement.

9:40 a.m.: CDC updates guidance for pediatricians

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its guidance on treating children during the pandemic to include information on a new illness associated with COVID-19.

The agency said it was working with domestic and international partners to better understand multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, aka MIS-C, including how common it is and its risk factors.

There are 220 possible and confirmed cases in 20 states and Washington, D.C., of the illness in children, according to an ABC News analysis. There have also been three reported deaths.

Some of the cases have tested positive for either COVID-19 or antibodies, while some others have tested negative. Many of the cases are still under investigation.

Children with MIS-C have presented to hospitals with a persistent fever and a variety of symptoms, including multi-organ (e.g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, hematologic, dermatologic, neurologic) involvement and elevated inflammatory markers, according to the CDC.

However, the CDC warned pediatricians that some children may exhibit symptoms not listed

It is possible that a child will begin exhibiting symptoms of MIS-C weeks after they were infected with COVID-19, according to the CDC. However, a child may not have displayed symptoms for COVID-19 and both the child and parents may not have even known they were infected.

The CDC said that evaluating a child for MIS-C could include a chest X-ray, echocardiography or blood testing to determine if there is inflammation.

For questions on the illness, the CDC's 24-hour Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 is open.

6:55 a.m.: Charges dropped against Tampa pastor

The charges against a Tampa pastor who was arrested after holding services despite the local stay-at-home orders have been dropped.

State officials said they dropped the charges against pastor Rodney Howard-Browne because he has complied with social distancing rules on his church campus since his arrest.

""In deciding whether to criminally prosecute violations of stay-at-home orders, compliance is our North Star,"" Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren said in a statement Friday. ""Each case is unique, and each one will be assessed based on the facts and the law. But, in general, if the person who was arrested poses no ongoing threat to public health, then our tendency will be not to prosecute the case beyond the arrest.""

Howard-Browne initially was arrested and charged with unlawful assembly and violation of a public health emergency order after holding large services at his church in defiance of the county's ""safer-at-home"" initiative.

""The State Attorney's Office has recognized that compliance and not criminal punishment is the focus of our emergency health laws,"" Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a statement Friday night. ""Law enforcement's intervention through arrest has been rare during this health crisis, and while it remains a necessary tool to protect the health and safety of our community, we agree that further criminal sanctions are not necessary in this instance.""

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Friday that Florida would move into a Phase 1 reopening on Monday, which means gyms can reopen and restaurants can now be at 50% capacity. The state's partial reopening began on May 4.

There have been more than 44,000 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and at least 1,917 deaths in Florida.

4:09 a.m.: New York tourist arrested in Hawaii for violating mandatory quarantine

A 23-year-old tourist from New York City was arrested Friday in Hawaii for violating the state's mandatory 14-day quarantine rule and for ""unsworn falsification to authority.""

Tarique Peters, according to the Hawaii Department of the Attorney General, arrived in Oahu on Monday and quickly posted numerous pictures of himself on the beach on Instagram.

He allegedly left his hotel room the day he arrived and traveled to various places using public transportation, officials said.

Citizens alerted local authorities to Peters' social media postings, which showed him on the beach with a surfboard, sunbathing and walking around Waikiki.

""We appreciate the assistance of local people who spot flagrant violations of our emergency rules on various social media sites and report them to the appropriate authorities,"" Hawaii Attorney General Clare Connors said in a statement Friday night.

Officials said the hotel told them Peters was seen leaving his room and the hotel on numerous occasions this week.

Peters, who's from the Bronx, was arrested Friday, and his bail was set at $4,000.

Hawaii has only 638 diagnosed cases of COVID-19, with at least 17 deaths.

226,226,299,‘There Will Be Losses’: How a Captain’s Plea Exposed a Rift in the Military,"
WASHINGTON — The captain had reached a breaking point.The aircraft carrier he commanded, the Theodore Roosevelt, was docked in Guam as the coronavirus raced unchecked through its narrow corridors. The warship’s doctors estimated that more than 50 crew members would die, but Capt. Brett E. Crozier’s superiors were balking at what they considered his drastic request to evacuate nearly the entire ship.
Captain Crozier was haunted by the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship of 2,600 passengers in individual cabins where the virus had killed eight people and infected more than 700. The situation on his ship had the potential to be far worse: nearly 5,000 sailors crammed in shared berths, sometimes stacked three high. Eight of his sailors with severe Covid-19 symptoms had already been evacuated to the Navy’s hospital in Guam.
On March 30, after four days of rebuffs from his superiors, Captain Crozier sat down to compose an email. “Sailors don’t need to die,” he wrote to 20 other people, all Navy personnel in the Pacific, asking for help. A Naval Academy graduate with nearly 30 years of military service, the captain knew the email would most likely end his career, his friends said in interviews. The military prizes its chain of command, and the appropriate course would have been for the captain to continue to push his superiors for action.
He hit “send” anyway.Three weeks later, the fired captain is battling the coronavirus himself, 584 other crew members have tested positive and the acting Navy secretary has resigned. The secretary, Thomas B. Modly, removed the captain because he thought that was what President Trump wanted, officials said. Mr. Modly, the officials said, was keenly aware that his predecessor in the job had been fired after tangling with Mr. Trump. But in trying to please the president, Mr. Modly miscalculated and destroyed his own career.
The story of the Theodore Roosevelt encapsulates, aboard a single aircraft carrier, Mr. Trump’s tumultuous three and a half years as commander in chief. The episode shows how the military, the most structured and hierarchical part of the government, has tried to adjust to an erratic president, and how in a hollowed-out leadership, acting secretaries have replaced those confirmed by the Senate.
Early Monday, the Navy announced that a sailor assigned to the Roosevelt had died of complications stemming from the coronavirus, marking the first death of a crew member from the ship. The sailor had been admitted into intensive care at the naval hospital in Guam on April 9 after being found unconscious in bed.
The Navy’s investigation into the entire episode is expected to be made public this week.This article is based on interviews with two dozen current and former Navy and Defense Department civilian and uniformed personnel, including Roosevelt crew members. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential meetings and discussions.
A Port Call UnravelsSailors aboard the Roosevelt most likely picked up the virus at a port call in Da Nang, Vietnam, on March 5 — just the second visit by an American aircraft carrier to that country since the end of the Vietnam War.
At the time, 16 coronavirus cases had been reported in Vietnam, all in the northern part of the country, far from Da Nang. The top Navy officer in the Pacific, Adm. Philip S. Davidson, ordered the long-scheduled visit to proceed as an important show of American military strength in a region increasingly unnerved by Beijing’s growing territorial claims in the South China Sea.
Da Nang’s piers are too small for a ship of the Roosevelt’s size to dock. So for its brief port call, it anchored offshore, relying on small boats to ferry the crew to the docks. Crew members posted pictures to social media of rooftop hotel pools and relaxation. One post said, “feelin vietnamazing.”
On the fourth and final day in Da Nang, after dozens of sailors had spent at least one night in a hotel where two British nationals tested positive for the virus, the Roosevelt ordered some crew members back to the ship for fear they might be exposed. Those who had stayed at the hotel were immediately isolated.
The Roosevelt went back out to sea, and its medical team watched closely for any sign of sickened sailors — a ticking clock during the 14-day period when symptoms would most likely appear. Over those same 14 days, aircraft flew on and off the ship, bringing in supplies from Japan and the Philippines.
Then came the announcement over the shipwide loudspeakers at dawn on March 24 as the carrier steamed through the western Pacific. “Set River City 1,” a voice ordered.
The sailors knew something had happened. River City means Reduced Communications — no internet access or phone calls for most of the crew.
Soon after, sailors posted outside the massive ship’s medical bays turned away crew members for anything that was not an emergency. Soon everyone knew: Three sailors had tested positive for the virus. The outbreak started in the reactor department, with its crew members responsible for running the very heart of the ship: the nuclear reactors.
The three were flown from the ship to a Navy hospital in Guam. Two days later, on March 26, the Roosevelt docked in Guam. Covid-19 testing began for the entire crew.
The argument between Captain Crozier and his superior aboard the ship, Rear Adm. Stuart P. Baker, began. The Navy high command, including Mr. Modly, was also on alert back in Washington.
Captain Crozier argued for evacuating nearly the entire crew. He wanted them quarantined and tested while the ship was professionally cleaned. A skeleton crew of 500 would remain aboard to operate the ship’s nuclear reactors, safeguard bombs and missiles and warplanes, and perform other essential duties.
Admiral Baker, who as commander of the carrier strike group oversees the Roosevelt and seven other ships, countered that less drastic measures would still protect the crew and leave the Roosevelt in operation. Mr. Modly and residents of Guam also expressed concerns that the island could not house all of the carrier’s crew if the order was given to evacuate, in particular if a growing number tested positive.
The Navy considered alternatives, including sending the Roosevelt to Okinawa, Japan, or to San Diego. Another option was to leave 4,000 sailors aboard the ship and 1,000 in a base gymnasium on Guam, where they would sleep on cots several feet apart. But a first attempt at housing some of the crew at the gym quickly resulted in more cases of the virus.
Back in Washington, Mr. Modly directed a top aide to contact Captain Crozier to ensure he was getting what he needed. The aide, Mr. Modly said later, reported that the captain was satisfied, “only asking that he wished the crew could be evacuated faster.”
But at this point, Captain Crozier was composing a four-page letter to be sent by unclassified email. In the recipient line, the header was bland: REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC.
The contents of the letter were not.“There are two end states T.R. could achieve,” Captain Crozier wrote. “We go to war with the force we have and fight sick.” In that situation, he wrote, “there will be losses to the virus.” Or, he wrote, the ship could try to “achieve a COVID-free T.R.,” with all the necessary evacuation.
“As war is not imminent, we recommend pursuing the peace time end state,” Captain Crozier wrote. He showed the email to a handful of the most senior officers on the ship. They told him they wanted to sign it, too. Captain Crozier, fearing for their careers, told them no.
Captain Crozier’s letter ran headlong into the administration’s narrative that it had everything under control.
A Communications BreakdownThe next day, March 31, as Mr. Modly arrived in Los Angeles to visit the Navy hospital ship Mercy, an aide had some news for him. A copy of Captain Crozier’s letter, which had not been sent to Mr. Modly, had found its way to The San Francisco Chronicle presumably leaked by one of the 20 recipients. The letter was spreading rapidly to other news outlets as well.
Mr. Modly was furious, although he restrained himself on a conference call with reporters the next day. “It’s disappointing to have him say that,” he told the reporters. “We’re doing everything we can.”
Worried that Captain Crozier’s letter would anger Mr. Trump, Mr. Modly called colleagues asking for advice, officials said. Should he fire Captain Crozier? Most of them, including Adm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told him he should order an investigation into the incident and wait and see the outcome.
But Mr. Modly, a Naval Academy graduate and former Navy helicopter pilot who was hoping to become the permanent Navy secretary, was still worried about what the president wanted, officials said. Mr. Modly’s predecessor, Richard V. Spencer, was fired for opposing the president’s intervention in support of Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL charged with war crimes who became a darling of Mr. Trump.
During a phone conversation with one adviser, Mr. Modly suddenly interrupted and said, according to a person familiar with the discussion, “Oh, breaking, the president wants him fired.” The person surmised that Mr. Modly had received a text message informing him of the president’s views.
On April 2, Mr. Modly called Admiral Baker, Captain Crozier’s immediate boss on the Roosevelt, and asked him if he knew about the letter in advance. Admiral Baker said that he did not, and that he would have told Captain Crozier not to send it. As Mr. Modly explained in an interview he later gave to the Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, he decided to fire Captain Crozier after that conversation.
Later that morning, Mr. Modly told Admiral Gilday, General Milley and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper that he had decided to fire Captain Crozier even before an investigation was conducted. The three told him they would publicly support his decision, despite the reservations of General Milley and Admiral Gilday.
Representative Adam Smith, the Washington Democrat who is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, condemned the move, as did three other Democrats on the panel. But they acknowledged that Captain Crozier might have mishandled the situation.
“Throwing the commanding officer overboard without a thorough investigation is not going to solve the growing crisis aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt,” the lawmakers said in a statement. “What’s more, we are very concerned about the chilling effect this dismissal will have on commanders throughout the Department of Defense.”
The dismissal and subsequent investigation hit the ship’s medical department hard right away. The same day Captain Crozier walked off the ship for the last time, Adm. Robert P. Burke, the Navy’s second-highest admiral, called the senior medical officer aboard the carrier as part of his investigation. Admiral Burke criticized the doctor, saying he had failed as a leader. In interviews, two crew members said Admiral Burke’s tone was hostile.
In an email, the Navy’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Charles W. Brown, said Admiral Burke “spoke with multiple individuals involved during the course of his investigation into the communication aboard U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt and with the chain of command.”
‘I Stand by Every Word’As Captain Crozier walked off his ship and down the gangway wearing a black backpack and baseball cap, hundreds of sailors and aircrew members showed up on the hangar bay to form a corridor for him. Videos of the crew cheering and shouting “Captain Crozier” immediately went viral.
And that, Navy officials said, infuriated Mr. Modly. His next actions stunned Pentagon officials and effectively turned the crew of the Roosevelt even more solidly against him.
Mr. Modly boarded a Gulfstream business jet at an airfield in suburban Washington and made the 35-hour round-trip flight to Guam, at a cost of $243,116.65, according to a Navy official, confirming a report in USA Today. When he landed, he spoke with Mr. Ignatius to defend himself. He also wrote a letter to The New York Times in which he again criticized the captain he had fired and who had, by now, tested positive for the coronavirus.
Then he went to the Roosevelt and delivered a 15-minute diatribe over the ship’s loudspeakers berating the crew for cheering for its captain. He called Captain Crozier either “too naïve” or “too stupid” to command an aircraft carrier. He told the sailors they should never trust the media. He blamed China for the virus. Less than 30 minutes later, after taking no questions from the sailors, he was gone.
Within another 30 minutes of his visit, audio of his remarks was being shared broadly across social media, complete with crew reaction. “What the…?” one sailor was heard saying when Mr. Modly called Captain Crozier “stupid.”
Navy officials, inundated with calls from incredulous reporters, called Mr. Modly — now flying back from Guam — asking him to respond. He doubled down, issuing a statement that “I stand by every word I said.”
By now, lawmakers were calling for him to be fired. So, too, were current and former military officials.
“What he said to the crew, I just completely disagree with that,” Mike Mullen, a retired admiral who was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said in an interview. “The content of it, how he said it, and actually, even that he was there on that ship to say it.”
Mr. Modly’s plane landed at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington on Monday night. In a phone call, Mr. Esper told him that he had to apologize, Defense Department officials said.
Seven hours after issuing his “I stand by every word I said” statement, Mr. Modly backpedaled. “I do not think Captain Brett Crozier is naïve nor stupid,” he said. “I think and always believed him to be the opposite.”
But the damage had been done. The next day, Mr. Modly, now in isolation himself because of potential exposure to the virus during his trip to the ship, called Mr. Esper to offer his resignation. A spokesman for Mr. Modly did not respond to a request for comment.
As for Captain Crozier, he remains alone in the “distinguished visitors quarters” on Naval Base Guam, battling a coronavirus infection. The 584 other crew members who have tested positive are also in quarantine on Guam, along with nearly 4,000 sailors who have been moved off the ship. One sailor with the virus remains in intensive care at the naval hospital on the island.
Navy officials say the Roosevelt may be fully cleaned and ready to resume its operations in the Pacific this month. More than 345,000 people have signed an online petition to reinstate Captain Crozier, a step that Admiral Gilday did not rule out last week.
Amid the fallout from Captain Crozier’s letter, senior military officials say they are concerned about other warships and other missions.
“From my perspective, I think it’s not a good idea to think that the Teddy Roosevelt is a one-of-a-kind issue,” Gen. John E. Hyten, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Thursday. “To think that it will never happen again is not a good way to plan.”
Three other carriers — the Ronald Reagan, the Carl Vinson and the Nimitz — have had sailors test positive, and the Navy is rushing to resolve their cases.",1
239,239,313,Lobbyists Descend On Washington Seeking Coronavirus Relief Money,"Lobbyists Descend On Washington Seeking Coronavirus Relief Money

Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images

Lobbyists are virtually descending on official Washington to try to gather as much as they can of the government's ongoing coronavirus relief packages.

Companies and interest groups — many of them new to the lobbying world — are competing for loans and other forms of financial help.

The Center for Responsive Politics tracks money spent in U.S. politics. Sheila Krumholz, the organization's executive director, talked with All Things Considered about the boom in lobbying for coronavirus relief. Here is some of that interview:

I'm curious what industries you've noticed are hiring lobbyists for the first time now.

About three-fourths of the new registrations sent for the last month have cited COVID and are by companies that are either new to lobbying or haven't lobbied in recent years. And about a third of those are for health care companies. ...

There are some related to education which aren't so typical, but lots of travel and tourism, gaming and entertainment, and retail and manufacturing, kind of what you would expect to see at this time.

Lobbying is traditionally face-to-face, it's this incremental process. What does that process look like now when everyone's working remotely and when the legislative process is so much more accelerated?

Like the rest of us, the lobbyists on K Street have had to pivot from in-person meetings to phone and video calls and emails. Not ideal when you're trying to sell a policy to Congress that needs quick information. But lobbyists can provide that if their calls are answered. So that's where the revolving door networks are really important. There are short time frames and the lack of in-person contact makes getting your call taken critical.

Have you spotted any examples of industries that are using this pandemic opportunistically, like to get something now that they have fought for in the past but couldn't get before?

Oh, absolutely. The bigger groups with lots of lobbying experience are adept at repackaging their existing agenda. It would be urgent and worthy of relief even when those items have been on the wish list for a long time. So hotels get a tax break they've been pushing for since 2017. Big banks have pushed for deregulation they've long wanted. Tech has pushed for delays in privacy laws and changes for gig workers. So that's being kind of mushed into the package.

423,423,520,How the coronavirus and Chicago’s gun violence are related,"Why hasn’t violence in Chicago decreased since we have all been ordered to stay at home? Why are the poorest African American neighborhoods that have been plagued by violence now the hardest hit by the coronavirus?

We think these problems have common roots and common solutions.

Gov. J. B. Pritzker issued a statewide shelter-in-place order five weeks ago in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Since that time, Chicago has had over 20,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 873 virus-related deaths. In that same time period, at least 294 people have been shot and 55 people have been killed in Chicago, placing the city on pace for roughly the same number of shootings and killings as in 2018 and 2019.

Opinion

The virus and violence have race and poverty in common. African Americans comprise roughly 30% of Chicago’s population but make up nearly half of its poor residents and 80% of its homicide victims.

Similarly, blacks represent at least 40% of Chicago’s coronavirus cases and 55% of its pandemic-related deaths. Part of this overrepresentation can be explained by black Chicagoans’ disproportionate rates of chronic health conditions, employment in “essential” economic sectors, reliance on public transportation and uninsurance, all of which increase one’s chances of infection and severe symptomatology.

But another key link between violence and the virus are large numbers of alienated young people on Chicago’s South and West Sides. Like in many other places, young people are ignoring the stay-at-home and social-distancing orders coming from elected officials, heightening the risk of viral infection and transmission. In Chicago, these young people are often the same ones involved in the city’s rampant gun violence that has persisted throughout the pandemic.

Our research with gang members in Chicago over the last 20 years indicates that today’s gang wars are vendettas driven by young people facing desolate circumstances and few, if any, meaningful prospects for a better life.

In other areas of the world, organized crime groups have stepped in to respond to the pandemic, filling voids left by the retreat of the state. In Mexico and southern Italy, drug cartels and Mafia groups are distributing packages of food to desperate residents. In the favelas of Brazil, drug gangs are imposing a curfew and South African gangs have organized peace treaties and are providing community aid.

Chicago, however, has no such organized gangs, particularly in its black neighborhoods, where the monolithic gangs of the 1980s and 1990s have shattered into small, hyperlocal, horizontally organized cliques. There has been no organized response to the pandemic from these groups, since they lack the organization and resources to form any such response. The old gang days are over, and the new cliques are hanging out as usual.

What is needed on Chicago’s South and West Sides, however, is not more organized gangs; it is a more legitimate and benevolent state. The desperate conditions in these communities that are driving both the gun violence and coronavirus crises have been caused by decades of private sector abandonment and a public sector that has largely abdicated its role in ensuring people’s welfare in favor of policing and incarcerating.

The public response should not be to lock these youth up in death traps like Cook County Jail, but to invest in the South and West Sides to give these youth essential resources, hope, and a reason to live. Mayor Lightfoot’s INVEST South/West proposal would do much to reverse decades of city abandonment in these communities, but without explicit protections for current residents, these efforts are likely to result in rent intensification and displacement for their targeted beneficiaries.

A broad-based public employment initiative is perhaps the most desperately needed intervention in communities where Depression-era levels of unemployment existed even before the pandemic — and are doubtlessly much worse now. The relative disorganization of today’s gangs and their often-marginal involvement in the illicit drug economy greatly enhances the potential success of such an initiative. Importantly, however, such a program wouldn’t be limited to these communities and would likely enjoy widespread support given the broader economic devastation wreaked by the coronavirus pandemic.

While the City of Chicago and State of Illinois should marshal whatever resources possible toward this end, they should also demand of their counterparts in Washington — both current and hopeful — that a robust federal response is needed. The recent $3 trillion stimulus proves that funding is no valid obstacle — that where there is a will, there is a way.

Let’s exert the pressure needed to create that will and tackle not only the current coronavirus pandemic, but the ongoing gun violence crisis as well.

Aspholm is an assistant professor of social work at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and the author of the recent book “Views from the Streets: The Transformation of Gangs and Violence on Chicago’s South Side.” John M. Hagedorn is a senior fellow at the Great Cities Institute and author or editor of six books, most recently including “The In$ane Chicago Way: The Daring Plan by Chicago Gangs to Create a Spanish Mafia.”

One Pandemic and Quarantine for the Elites, Another for Everyone Else

Our fight against the coronavirus is slowly and steadily improving, but . . . we’re still a long ways away from out of the woods. From the numbers on Worldometers, 1,552 Americans succumbed to the disease Tuesday and another 1,403 Americans on Wednesday. We’re trending down significantly from the roughly 2,500 per day at the beginning of the month, but . . . that’s still about a half a 9/11 per day. We’re diagnosing about 20,000 to 30,000 new cases a day; we were above 30,000 new cases per day for most of April.

The economic aftershocks have been calamitous. There’s never been a higher demand at food banks. Our kids are still out of school, and across the country, summer camps, programs, and other activities are being canceled. Schools aren’t sure if they will reopen in the fall, meaning that this just-barely-adequate-if-we’re-lucky “distance learning” may continue, in a situation that Michael Brendan Dougherty observes leaves parents with all of the costs of homeschooling but none of the benefits. Most kids haven’t seen a non-sibling peer in person in two-and-a-half months; the plan, I guess, is to continue this isolation through most of the rest of the year. In any other circumstance, we would consider that child abuse. In just about any other hardship that can befall a child, they still get to see their friends!

We’ve still got giant problems to work out. It’s one thing to reopen society in a way that accounts for a contagious virus; it’s another thing to reopen society in a way that accounts for a contagious virus and lawyers that are eager to sue people. The CDC says swimming pools should be safe as long as people take the usual social-distancing precautions outside the water, but across the country, cities are deciding to keep their public pools closed. The restaurant and bar industry, the movie-theater industry, the hotel and tourism industry, theme parks, airlines — all of them are desperately trying to figure out how to stay afloat with a small fraction of their usual customer base. Removing the government restrictions is one step, but people still need to feel safe using those businesses before they’ll come back in significant numbers.

Everybody’s enduring hardship in one form or another. Well, almost everybody.

From the beginning, we’ve seen evidence that the wealthy and well-connected could more or less buy their way out of the inconveniences and hardship of quarantines. This April story by Vicky Ward at CNN stuck with me:

Last week, a Washington, DC-based media executive who is used to attending 200 cocktail parties a year decided that he could take talking to his microwave no more. In contravention of the city’s shelter-in-place executive order, he secretly attended two different dinner parties in Georgetown, an affluent DC-neighborhood. When he first told me this, I assumed I had either misheard or misunderstood. “Virtual dinners right?” I asked. “No” was the reply. These were the old-fashioned, in-person sort. Each time, he explained, the host’s instructions were the same. For both dinners, he entered through the back gate of the property, so disapproving neighbors would not see him. He was told in advance that neither he, nor any other guests, could take any photographs or talk about the party. The first dinner was hosted by a movie producer. A group of four listened to music and sat under heated lamps six feet apart in the garden where they were served dinner. According to the executive, none had been in contact with anyone who had suffered Covid-19 — as far as they knew. All had been isolating. At that dinner party, the food was prepared by a live-in chef, who was masked and gloved, and then served by the producer’s wife. At the second party, held over the weekend at the home of a Democrat political operative, one of the guests brought the food: “lamb to belatedly celebrate Easter.” In attendance were an ambassador, a city councilman and a well-known lobbyist. The night was balmy and they all sat outside for hours. “People did not want to leave,” the media executive told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity, to avoid being Covid-shamed — a new shorthand term for people behaving with apparent indifference to the safety of others. “But everyone had been cooped up for so long, there was much to discuss.”

I’ll give you a moment to cope with the shock that a Washington-based media executive, a movie producer, a Democratic political operative, a Washington city councilman, and a well-known lobbyist and their spouses believed the rules didn’t apply to them. At least the ambassador could hide behind diplomatic immunity. (Where’s Roger Murtaugh when you need him?)

Apparently, quarantines are for the little people. If quarantines are optional for the wealthy and well-connected, we should not be surprised that they find them much more tolerable and worthy of extension than everyone else.

Last week, the New York Times reviewed data and concludes, “roughly 5 percent of residents — or about 420,000 people — left the city between March 1 and May 1. In the city’s very wealthiest blocks, in neighborhoods like the Upper East Side, the West Village, SoHo and Brooklyn Heights, residential population decreased by 40 percent or more, while the rest of the city saw comparably modest changes.” If you are wealthy enough to own a second home, you have another place to go if you deem the risk of remaining at your current residence too high.

Today in the New York Post, David Marcus unleashes a furious rant that his home city’s strict quarantine rules are choking the life out of the city:

Beloved haunts, storied rooms, perfect-slice joints are shuttered, many for good. The sweat equity of countless small-business owners is evaporating. Instead of getting people back to work providing for their families, our mayor talks about a fantasyland New Deal for the post-coronavirus era. Open the city. All of it. Right now. Broadway shows, beaches, Yankees games, the schools, the top of the freakin’ Empire State building. Everything. New Yorkers have already learned to socially distance. Businesses can adjust. The elderly and infirm can continue to be isolated.

One other indicator of the divide between those who are minimally impacted by the pandemic restrictions and the rest: Have you noticed how a portion of the news environment is moving on from the pandemic, even though our daily lives have not?

Are News Institutions Getting Tired of Covering the Coronavirus?

I go back and forth on how much the focus of the news should shift away from the pandemic, and how quickly. In normal times, the Michael Flynn unmasking revelations and arguments would be front-page news, day after day. You can tell that much of the world is eager to argue about Matt Lauer trying to return to public life, or how mean Alison Roman was to those poor celebrities like Chrissy Tiegen and Marie Condo. Jonathan Safran Foer takes to the New York Times to instruct us, “If you care about the working poor, about racial justice, and about climate change, you have to stop eating animals.”

You can see how many people are itching to return to the familiar culture-war fights — Kamala Harris introduced a resolution declaring use of the term “Wuhan virus” racist. The Atlantic unveiled a new special section on conspiracy theories, although I still haven’t found an article discussing the cover story in New York magazine asking whether Donald Trump has been an asset of Russian intelligence since 1987. The Washington Post warns that southern states are being reckless in how they’re reopening.

(Connecticut has now reopened retail stores, offices with an encouragement to continue working from home, university research programs, and outdoor zoos. I await the Washington Post feature story on how new clusters of coronavirus spread could soon flare across parts of the Nutmeg State.)

I’m not saying that non-coronavirus news doesn’t matter at all. But you’ve probably noticed that this newsletter turned into nearly all-coronavirus, all-the-time in March and hasn’t looked back. Sometimes I miss the old familiar political news and discussion, too. But the pandemic and its aftershocks are the biggest story in the world right now, one that shoves all other news — even traditionally big stories such as a presidential election or North Korea — into the background.

I wonder if coronavirus fatigue is driving increasing servings of silliness in our news diet.

For the past two months, one of the most dangerous places in the world has been a nursing home in New York state. Chris Cuomo teased his brother, New York governor Andrew Cuomo, about the size of his nose with a giant nasal-swab prop. I remind you this is CNN in prime time, and not Saturday Night Live. The brothers’ bickering was cute at the beginning of this pandemic, but we’re now approaching the end of its tenth week.

Don’t Touch That! . . . but It Probably Won’t Kill You

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adjusted its coronavirus guidelines slightly Wednesday, emphasizing that the virus spreads easily from person to person but “does not spread easily” in other ways, such as touching objects.

We would get through this ordeal easier if everyone in positions of authority could be a little more honest about what they know, what they think they know, and what they don’t know. I’ll be honest: I thought, based upon what we were seeing, that spread in places such as the New York City subways was driven in large part by people touching the same objects — poles, handrails, buttons, turnstiles, etc. Apparently, that was a smaller factor, and the primary factor was just people coming within six feet of each other.

ADDENDUM: Advice from Nicholas Kristof that many are sure to ignore: “The odd thing about reporting on the coronavirus is that the nonexperts are supremely confident in their predictions, while epidemiologists keep telling me that they don’t really know much at all. Some of that epidemiological humility should seep into public discourse.”",0

Nightlife looks completely different these days.

Bar patrons have taken things into their own hands -- shaking up cocktails at home, ordering booze from an app, turning up Bluetooth speakers to listen to a virtual DJ on Instagram live, maybe even while Zooming with friends.

But can that ever fully replace elbowing up to a crowded bar, chatting up a bartender and everything else that comes with a night out?

In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, with new social distancing requirements and ever-changing, state-by-state safety restrictions, many owners of bars and clubs are waiting with bated breath.

The coveted counter space and tables at Dante -- a famously packed, award-winning cocktail bar and restaurant in New York City -- quickly shifted to slinging specialty drinks via curbside pickup and delivery until restrictions are eased. But the staffers are taking service amid the pandemic ""one day at a time"" until they construct a plan to fully reopen.

""To be honest, none of us have any idea as to when things will really start to change,"" Linden Pride, owner of the Greenwich Village staple, told ABC News. ""This whole process has pushed us to create a full takeout and delivery menu, as well as cocktails to-go, which has taken us out of our comfort zone to create new, alternative experiences for our guests.""

Pride said he wants to continue the new experiences ""once this is all over."" He and his wife, Natalie, got the idea from a pop-up cocktail event in New Orleans, where people ""drink in a plastic cup and walk down the street."" They found thousands of stickers left over that read, ""'One for the road,' or 'a roadie' as we call it in Australia,"" Pride added.

He hailed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for quickly recognizing current liquor-licensing regulations that needed to be amended.

""As soon as the changes were brought into effect, which allowed cocktails to be purchased both for pick-up and delivery, with food, we saw this as an opportunity to try and keep the business operational, which would allow us to retain staff whilst continuing to provide a service to the community,"" Pride told ABC News.

Pride said, ""it's so hard to know"" definitively what service operations at Dante might look like in the future, but that he and his staff are keeping a close eye on operations in other states, including Georgia and Colorado.

""When we're allowed to open, we will adhere to CDC, WHO and state guidelines,"" Pride said, adding that he's already stocked up on thermometers to check people's temperatures at the door and that he's looking into creating disposable menus and setting up sanitizing stations, in addition to enforcing social distancing.

""One cool initiative"" he's seen at bars and restaurants in parts of Europe, ""is the extension of outdoor dining -- with some street closures."" Pride said he sees a ""real opportunity in New York"" for designated outdoor dining and drinking areas to enable places on low-traffic streets to set up ""socially distanced tables"" and serve people responsibly.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that the possibility of restaurants and bars opening in the city's streets is ""being very thoroughly discussed"" and ""something we might be able to reach.""

""I've been talking to restaurant owners ... they're making a great case that this could be a difference-maker,"" de Blasio said. ""You have the right social distancing and protections, the right capacity ... and the right atmosphere. We have to be smart about it."" This could only come after New York City meets the city's indicators for 10 to 14 days and meets the state's indicators, which de Blasio said could be possible in the first half of June.

Pride said that with ""any kind of reopening, it doesn't mean that customers are going to flock to [bars] and fill up those seats."" Dante will look for other inventive options to recreate what Pride calls the ""ritual and experience"" of going out, like ""creating a Friday night takeaway kit"" complete with cocktails and a playlist to give customers the full experience at home.

Pride has also been in contact with close friends in the industry, including the operator of New York's PDT, and said bars and lounges that rely solely on beverages and bottle service will face ""a huge challenge because they don't have full-service kitchens.""

A standard liquor license requires nightclubs and bars to serve food in order to run a full-service beer, wine and liquor operation, according to the New York State Liquor Authority.

Eddie Dean, owner of the Brooklyn club Schimanski, has been through many ups and downs after 30 years in the nightlife business, but he's worried now about bars and clubs.

""These businesses are built on volume. A very large percentage of small bars and restaurants pretty much go week to week hoping to make payroll,"" he told ABC News. ""I imagine a high percentage of New York City-based hospitality businesses will not reopen -- or open but not be able to sustain. It's going to be ugly.""

Schimanski ""acted fast to close down"" -- perishable items cleaned out, sound equipment covered, employees furloughed. Dean now is having ""preliminary conversations"" with the landlord to ""get through this mess as best as possible.""

""So far,"" he added, ""I have not heard anything positive for clubs. Any notion of opening at 25 or 50% capacity or even 75% isn't realistic. We will do what it takes to ensure the safety of our staff and all our guests.""

Even amid the current difficulties, Dean said there have been silver linings, like staying in touch with his team and ""thinking of new ideas and concepts."" And being able to rest a bit ""has been welcome.""

""Anyone who knows me knows I love a good challenge. This is certainly a big challenge. I can't wait to get back and do great things,"" he added.

Slate, a multi-floor lounge and nightclub with multiple bars and hundreds of hands-on games like pool and ping pong, has catered to Manhattan's lively late-night crowds for over 20 years. But it could struggle welcoming back customers at a 6-foot distance.

Owner Aristotle ""Telly"" Hatzigeorgiou told ABC News, ""We're adjusting as best we can.""

The owner's plan for a return to operations will eventually include ""strict sanitation guidelines that will be followed between each use, and we'll make sure all tables, chairs and games are spread apart enough that people can safely socially distance themselves.""

He added: ""Temperatures will be taken at the door. Hand sanitation stations will be placed all over the venue, and markers will be placed both inside and on the sidewalk outside for any line that may form to ensure guests stay 6 feet apart while we check IDs, take temperatures and check coats.""

Hatzigeorgiou plans to take full advantage of the sprawling 17,000-square foot, two-floor space. ""Once restaurants are given the OK to open in NYC,"" he said, ""we can start to open some parts of Slate.""

For bars with live music, like Howl at the Moon in San Antonio, COVID-19 could silence the big, bustling crowds that scribble down song requests and pass the papers up through the bar to the stage.

Denise Ramirez, a musician who plays piano at the hopping venue on the San Antonio Riverwalk, told ABC News that after three years there she has a different perspective for what a new normal could mean.

""Howl is typically a packed house, especially on weekends when we get a lot of bachelorette parties and birthday parties booking up tables,"" she said.

The music-centric bar has 14 different locations in the U.S. and has to keep track of ""all the different regulations being put in place by different state and local governments,"" Ramirez explained. ""I can only assume that's only made it more difficult for them as a company to figure out what they're going to do.""

""Their plan is to wait until bars can open at a full capacity or near-full capacity, because in their words, 'Howl has to be Howl,' which makes sense to me,"" the pianist said. ""I've been part of a now-closed Howl establishment in New York City and have seen what happens if it tries to remain open for only five people on a Tuesday. And I think it's the right move.""

Ramirez and the other entertainers, bartenders, servers and door attendants were furloughed, and she thinks they will ""wait quite a bit before reopening,"" even with the state of Texas currently reopening restaurants at 25% capacity. ""The return to nightlife is going to be a mixed bag. I would expect lots of excitement from everyone having cabin fever, but I'd also expect quite a few rules in place.""

""I don't think anyone wants to be singing on stage with masks on,"" Ramirez said about a discussion with her fellow musician friends. ""We turn to nightlife to escape from our problems, so having a reminder of the pandemic onstage in front of us would kind of defeat that purpose.""

956,956,1149,Italy announces plans to lift travel restrictions as infection rate falls,"After several months in lockdown, Italy has announced plans to lift its coronavirus travel ban. The country, an epicenter of the pandemic, plans to be mostly reopened within the next few weeks, with strict health guidelines.

The Italian government plans to allow travel to and from the country beginning June 3, according to a new decree signed Saturday by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Citizens will also be able to travel freely within the country starting that same day.

Certain travel may still be limited based on disease risks, which will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. People who have tested positive for COVID-19 will still remain under strict quarantine orders.

The travel ban lifts the day after Italy's Republic Day, likely preventing mass travel over a long holiday weekend.

Italy's infection rate has fallen sharply in recent days. Despite calls for a quicker reopening, Conte said a gradual return to normalcy can help prevent a second wave of infections, Reuters reports.

Some shops in Italy start to reopen amid pandemic

According to the decree, all sectors of the economy still shuttered can reopen in June, as long as proper safety guidelines, social distancing and hygiene rules are adhered to. Health officials plan to closely monitor reopening in order to limit further infections.

The country maintained strict lockdown guidelines until May 4, when it allowed factories and parks to reopen. Shops plan to open May 18, and that same day, people will be able to move freely within their region.

Before coronavirus truly took hold in the United States, Italy had the highest number of COVID-19 infections in the world. It was the first European country to impose nationwide lockdown restrictions and has struggled for months to limit the virus' spread.

Italy currently has the fifth-highest number of confirmed infections globally with over 233,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. It has the third-highest death toll, behind the U.S. and the U.K., with over 31,000 confirmed deaths.",1
555,555,677,3 charts show the alarming ways school closures have left America's most vulnerable children behind,"The novel coronavirus has forced many schools to close, meaning students have needed to adapt quickly to remote learning.

However, this has caused challenges for students who don't have a computer or WiFi at home to keep up with schoolwork.

A recent survey from Pew Research Center found the percentage of children who likely cannot complete their schoolwork during coronavirus school closures varies by their parents' income.

More than a third of lower-income parents believe it is somewhat or very likely their children will not be able to finish their schoolwork because they don't have a computer at home.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The novel coronavirus outbreak has required children to quickly adjust to remote courses as schools closed to help mitigate the spread of the virus. However, remote learning has caused challenges for students who don't have internet access or a computer at home.

Per figures from the Department of Commerce, 14%, or 7 million, children between 6-17 years old lived in households without internet access in 2017.

That digital divide varies by region. Many cities in Alabama, Texas, and New Mexico have large shares of households without an internet subscription or a computer, based on US Census data.

The ""homework gap"" between students who lack the proper resources to complete their work and those who have these resources has been exacerbated during the coronavirus, based on new survey results from Pew Research Center.

The new Pew poll surveyed 4,917 US adults from April 7-12 about their children's ability to complete schoolwork from home.

According to the results, 22% of parents reported it is somewhat or very likely their children will have to use public WiFi during remote learning because they don't have reliable internet in their households. 21% also reported it is somewhat or very likely their children will not be able to complete their schoolwork at all because they do not have a computer.

Illustrating the ""digital divide"" between higher- and lower-income families, the results vary when separated by the respondent's income level. Lower-income parents reported higher shares of their children likely having to complete their schoolwork on a cellphone, through public WiFi, or not being able to complete their work at all compared to middle- and upper-income families.

Schools, internet providers, and states have all tried to help students get the proper resources to move to remote learning, but it has not been easy. In California, Google recently set up 100,000 broadband access points and plan to give thousands of students Chromebooks to help those in need. Even though Spectrum internet is giving 60 days of free internet access to families, people who have unpaid bills or already have an account cannot redeem this deal.

Some schools have reportedly tried other methods to ensure students can still complete schoolwork, such as people delivering schoolwork on paper to homes or using buses with WiFi signals.

Pew's survey results also indicate that 37% of Americans believe schools should be giving out computers to students during the outbreak. However, this opinion is divided along political lines. 45% of Democrats believe computers should be given to all students from the school, 17 percentage points higher than Republicans.

The partisan divide is smaller when focusing on students most in need. The difference between political parties is minimal for those who believe only students who cannot afford a computer should be given one during coronavirus, with 44% of Democrats and 42% of Republicans supporting this option.

The following three charts highlight the difficulty of completing schoolwork for children amid the coronavirus based on Pew survey respondents' income. The income levels used by Pew Research Center are based on 2018 earning figures where ""middle income is defined here as two-thirds to double the median annual income for all [Pew] panelists. Lower income falls below that range; upper income falls above it.""",1
1136,1136,1378,Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine shows encouraging early results,"The company’s stock, along with the Dow Jones industrial average, soared on the report that eight participants who received low and medium doses of Moderna’s vaccine had blood levels of virus-fighting antibodies that were similar or greater than those in recovered covid-19 patients. That suggests, but doesn’t prove, that it triggers some level of immunity.





Moderna’s announcement comes days after one of its directors, Moncef Slaoui, stepped down from the board to become chief scientist for Operation Warp Speed, a White House initiative to speed up vaccine development. Watchdogs called out Slaoui’s apparent conflict of interest. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Slaoui’s stock options in Moderna are worth more than $10 million with the company’s share price at $66.69. In regular trading Monday, Moderna’s stock soared almost 20 percent to $80.

Moderna also received $483 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a federal agency. Moderna has also partnered with a contract development and manufacturing firm, Lonza, and Slaoui stepped down from that company’s board on Monday.

Slaoui will divest his Moderna stock holdings, effective Tuesday morning, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said Monday afternoon. He will donate the value the Moderna stock gained since Thursday, before the announcement of his position leading Operation Warp Speed, to cancer research.





Companies and countries are racing to create a coronavirus vaccine and taking on financial risk to manufacture doses in large quantities before they even know if the products are safe and effective. The U.S. is aiming to have hundreds of millions of doses of a vaccine broadly available by the end of the year.

An effort led by the University of Oxford, in partnership with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, plans to have millions of doses of vaccine available by fall. Last week, those researchers disclosed that more than 1,000 patients had already enrolled in the initial trial of its vaccine, which began in late April.

A Chinese company, Sinovac Biotech, recently published a study in the journal Science showing that its vaccine protected rhesus monkeys against infection and is currently being tested in 144 people. Two other safety trials are ongoing in the U.S., led by Pfizer and Inovio Pharmaceuticals.





Vaccine experts have said that these accelerated development timelines are theoretically possible, but extremely optimistic — and depend on everything going right. They stress that it will be crucial to gather convincing data the vaccines are safe and effective before using them broadly — and the new data are promising but preliminary, from the earliest phase one trials that test safety in healthy people.

“I would certainly take this as good news, and it’s certainly worth moving forward” into later stage trials, said Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “There’s just historically, if you look at vaccine development, lots of vaccines that look good out of phase one that don’t turn out to be good products.”

The data released Monday by Moderna is encouraging, but represents only a first step in a long process to bring a vaccine to market. It comes from an interim report on dozens of patients followed over weeks, whereas vaccine approval requires broad testing in thousands of patients followed over many months or years.





Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the data looked promising and it made sense to proceed to a large trial this summer.

“The fact that the vaccine elicited neutralizing antibody amounts comparable or higher to those found in convalescent sera [plasma] is very encouraging,” said Arturo Casadevall, chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who is spearheading the initiative to test plasma as a treatment.

Peter Jay Hotez, who is working on developing a coronavirus vaccine at the Baylor College of Medicine, said it would be important to understand the level of antibodies detected in the patients beyond the information provided in a company news release. He pointed to emerging evidence that many recovered patients do not muster high levels after they recover — and that high levels of antibodies may be needed to neutralize the virus.





The vaccine showed few safety signals, aside from redness at the injection site for one patient and some transient “systemic” symptoms in three patients given the highest dose — which the company will not be using in future trials.

The interim data comes from a clinical trial aimed at showing the safety of its experimental vaccine and helping the company select the correct dose. The company has not yet picked the final dose, or announced the size or length of the large trial that it will start in July, which will be the key one that regulators consider to decide whether the vaccine is safe and effective.

This month, the company received permission from the Food and Drug Administration to begin a 600-person, phase two trial to begin to test the effectiveness of the vaccine.



“We are very, very happy because first the vaccine was generally safe,” Stephane Bancel, chief executive of Moderna said in an interview. “The piece that was really exciting and was the big question, of course, was can you find antibodies in people in enough quantities” to prevent disease.



Moderna also reported that the vaccine protected mice who were vaccinated and then exposed to the virus, preventing it from multiplying in their lungs.

Moderna’s vaccine uses a genetic material called messenger RNA that codes for the distinctive spike protein that studs the outside of the novel coronavirus. The vaccine delivers the messenger RNA to cells, which then follows the genetic instructions to create the virus protein — allowing the body to learn to recognize and neutralize the pathogen.",1
282,282,362,Illinois voter turnout not among the casualties of COVID-19,"SPRINGFIELD — Despite calls to postpone the election and concerns that cramped polling places and long lines could keep people away, Illinois voters still cast ballots in last month’s primary at a level that did not set any low-turnout records.

Illinois election officials are crediting mail-in balloting and early voting with keeping the numbers up.

In Illinois, 28.36% of registered voters cast ballots in the March 17 primary, which is the third-lowest turnout for a presidential primary over the past 40 years, according to the official canvas released Friday.

But while the voter turnout was relatively low, it was comparable to recent presidential primaries.

Four of the previous six presidential primaries saw turnouts of less than 30 percent. And this year’s turnout topped the 2012 presidential primary, which had a 23.2% turnout and 2000’s nominating contest, which had 25.91%.

This year, 2,279,439 of the state’s 8,036,534 registered voters cast ballots in the March primary.

What saved voter turnout from bottoming out during the coronavirus pandemic for this year’s primary were options that allowed voters to avoid the precincts on Election Day, said Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections.

“It looks like we did have some offset from people who voted early and voted by mail,” Dietrich said.

Early numbers show vote-by-mail ballots increased from the previous primary election — 10% of total ballots cast this year, compared to 3% in the 2016 primary, according to the board’s unofficial numbers.

Early voting was also up, Dietrich said, with about 636,000 people opting to vote early, compared to 520,000 in 2016, according to unofficial numbers.

The statewide turnout was also boosted by Chicago, where election officials have already released figures showing a city turnout of 37.78% — also crediting early and mail-in voting with boosting the final numbers.

The statewide canvas released Friday included the final results for contests up and down the ballot.

Among the Democratic presidential contenders, former Vice President Joe Biden ran away with the primary, winning 58.94% of the vote, compared to the nearest contender, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who nabbed 36.18%.

In the contentious 3rd Congressional District Democratic primary, challenger Marie Newman won 47.26% of the vote, beating incumbent eight-term Rep. Dan Lipinski, who won 44.72%.",1
822,822,991,A 12-year-old girl survived a heart attack after contracting the coronavirus and a rare inflammatory syndrome linked to the virus,"A 12-year-old girl has become the first child to talk to the press about having a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome that has been seen in over 100 children worldwide in recent months.

Juliet Daly, from Louisiana, went into cardiac arrest and required CPR.

One of her doctors said she ""was about as close to death as you can get.""

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

A 12-year-old from Louisiana has survived a cardiac arrest linked to the coronavirus and a rare inflammatory disorder that has been seen in clusters of children around the world since the pandemic began.

Juliet Daly has made a full recovery after doctors performed two minutes of CPR to revive her.

The medical team later told her father, Sean Daly, that Juliet was suffering from the same multisystem inflammatory syndrome that over 100 children have recently been diagnosed with, including dozens across 15 states in the US.

Dr. Jake Kleinmahon, a pediatric cardiologist at Ochsner Hospital for Children in New Orleans, where Juliet was treated, told CNN that her case of the syndrome was a result of her immune system overreacting to the coronavirus, and causing inflammation throughout the body.

She ""was about as close to death as you can get,"" Kleinmahon said.

Juliet was on a ventilator for four days, and left the hospital on May 15, according to TIME.

Juliet's did not initially have the breathing problems most adults have with COVID-19. Instead she had stomach pain and vomiting, and her lips turned blue.

""I really didn't understand how serious it was but I was scared,"" Juliet, the first child to talk to the press about the experience of the new multisystem inflammatory syndrome, told CNN.

There are plenty of unknowns about the new syndrome, which bears similarities to Kawasaki disease, a little-understood inflammatory disease that predominantely strikes children, and seems to be triggered by a virus or bacterial infection.

The new syndrome has similar symptoms to Kawasaki, like fever and rash. Doctors have also recorded swelling of hands and feet, swollen lymph glands in the neck, and irritation and inflammation of the mouth, lips, and throat.

Some doctors are theorizing that having coronavirus can trigger the immune system's overreaction, and one recent study done by doctors in Bergamo, Italy, found a ""strong association"" between the two conditions.

The disease can be treated with high doses of aspirin or an IV drip of gamma globulin. Without treatment, 15 to 25% of people with disease will develop thinning or bulging of the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, which can be fatal, according to the US National Library of Medicine.

At least three children in New York have died from the syndrome, and states like Kentucky and Michigan are also reporting cases. The CDC has published a health advisory warning doctors to look out for the symptoms.",1
1285,1287,1699,"Italian leader calls Bill Gates a “vaccine criminal,” demands his arrest for crimes against humanity","(Natural News) Just a few days after it was revealed through an intercepted human intelligence report that Bill Gates is attempting to bribe Nigerian politicians into passing a mandatory vaccination bill for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), an Italian politician has come forward to demand that the billionaire software tycoon be immediately handed over to international courts to be tried for committing crimes against humanity.

Sara Cunial, who previously sounded the alarm about how Gates has been pushing his vaccine agenda in Africa and India for years, says that this “vaccine criminal” needs to be taken off the streets and dealt with for the protection of humanity. In essence, she declared that he is a threat to human civilization and the safety of children.

Leave it to Italy to be the nation that calls a spade a spade when it comes to the nefarious activities of Bill Gates, who our own media and politicians routinely praise for his alleged “contributions” to “humanitarian” efforts. Not only is Gates a fraud, but he is a proven genocidal maniac who is actively trying to “thin the herd” through mass vaccination.

Gates hates freedom, and even more than that he hates innocent humanity, and particularly precious children whom he sees as nothing more than human guinea pigs to be exploited for financial and political gain. Gates is a dangerous criminal, in other words, and Cunial is right: He needs to go.

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, discusses how mandatory vaccination is a form of medical rape, and those who engage in forcing vaccines on people are guilty of committing felony assault:

Just say NO to Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines

Keep in mind that as far back as 2015, Italian leaders were actively warning the world that communist China was conducing biological experiments with coronaviruses. A November 2015 broadcast, in fact, showed Chinese scientists meddling with SARS (severe acute respiratory system), a cousin of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

It was asked at that time whether such experiments were even necessary, let alone safe. If there was even a small possibility that such viruses might escape into the general public, then such experiments needed to end, was the message being loudly sent.

As for this latest experiment gone wrong, or so it would seem, Cunial gave a resounding seven-minute speech recently claiming that Italy was subjected to a “holy inquisition of false science.” She added that Italy’s lockdowns were completely unnecessary and were only implemented to advance the globalist agenda, which as we know is being largely spearheaded by Gates and his vaccine agenda.

Cunial continues to urge her fellow political leaders to wake up to what is going on and reject it. She warns that any attempt at compulsory vaccination with a future Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is a deep state plot to consolidate power and control the masses.

“It is our children who will lose more, who are ‘raped souls,’ with the help of the so-called ‘guarantor of their rights’ and of CISMAI (Italian Coordination of Services against Child Abuse),” Cunial stated as part of her speech, warning about the devastating impacts of all of this on Italy’s, and really the world’s, precious children.

“In this way, the right to school will be granted only with a bracelet to get them used to probation, to get them used to slavery â involuntary treatment and to virtual lager. All this in exchange for a push-scooter and a tablet. All to satisfy the appetites of a financial capitalism whose driving force is the conflict of interest, conflict well represented by the WHO, whose main financier is the well-known ‘philanthropist and savior of the world’ Bill Gates.”

Cunial’s entire speech is available at this link.

968,968,1161,The Trump Campaign Brings Its Angry Tone to the Coronavirus Era,"Donald Trump, Jr., the President’s eldest son, thinks that his father is getting a raw deal. In a recent appearance on “Team Trump Online”—a nightly video series that serves as a substitute for campaign rallies and often attracts more than a million viewers—he complained that his father is having to wage war against “the deep-state guys” and unchecked attacks from “influencers on the other side.” He said that each reporter at the White House briefings “has an agenda, and that is to destroy Donald Trump.” Joe Biden “can’t remember where he is fifty per cent of the time,” Trump, Jr., said, but he can count on the “media lackeys” who are the “marketing wing of the Democrat Party.” The Democrats, he added, are “becoming the party of socialism and communism.” That includes Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib—“you know, the Hamas caucus in Congress.” As for the COVID-19 outbreak, which has caused more than eighty thousand deaths in the U.S. to date, he said, “China basically screwed the whole world.”

Venom and victimization largely define the President’s public persona, and the same holds true for the online campaign. Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee in early March, and the COVID-19 pandemic put a halt to barnstorming a few weeks later, but the rhetoric of Trump’s campaign has barely budged. On March 12th, as the coronavirus crisis was taking hold in the United States, it e-mailed its supporters a photograph of Trump, ruddy face fully made up, a flag pin in his lapel, sitting behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, looking steely. The e-mail said that there is “no room for partisanship, and the President is calling on both parties in Congress to unite.” The very next day, when Trump declared a national emergency, the campaign reverted to form, blasting “Sleepy Joe” and “Crazy Bernie.” Last weekend, after the Justice Department dropped its charges against Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national-security adviser, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., the campaign crowed, in a fund-raising text, “Justice for Gen Flynn! A WITCH HUNT from day 1! ALL GIFTS TRIPLED TO DRAIN THE SWAMP.”

Anyone who has attended Trump’s rallies, where thousands of fans in MAGA hats whoop and cheer at his insults and diatribes, can attest that the President, ever a showman, knows how to play to his target audiences. And, yet, as Biden edges into the lead in key states, such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Florida, pollsters and political strategists are questioning whether Trump’s perennial pitch can carry him to victory on November 3rd. His political base is loyal but narrow. When Democrats scored heavily in the suburbs in the 2018 midterms, and captured a majority in the House of Representatives, it was women voters who made the difference. A recent Quinnipiac poll in Florida showed Trump lagging behind Biden among women, and also among two groups that delivered crucial support in 2016: voters over the age of sixty-five and voters who dislike both candidates. When I asked Douglas Schwartz, the director of the Quinnipiac poll, about the survey, he said that Biden does better among both groups on honesty, leadership, and empathy. “These numbers are a warning sign for his campaign,” Schwartz said of the President.

The Trump campaign brags about an army of field organizers, the cell-phone numbers of tens of millions of supporters, and a new app that connects voters to news, virtual events, and volunteer opportunities, from fund-raising to voter registration. Each is a significant upgrade from Trump’s 2016 effort, which relied on his outsized personality, his televised rallies, and the power of social media. The current operation, led by Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s successful Facebook marketing campaign in 2016, has raised more than seven hundred and thirty million dollars. In cash-on-hand, Biden lags tens of millions of dollars behind. “It’s not like a campaign of grievance and anger and fear hasn’t been a pillar of American politics since there was an American politics,” Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster who worked on Barack Obama’s Presidential campaigns, said. “That’s exactly how Trump won.” Republicans are right to be worried, Belcher added, but even as Trump struggles to expand his base COVID-19 and the plunging economy are making predictions difficult. “Given that environment, where people are afraid and anxious—and understandably so—can you count out a candidate peddling grievance and fear?”

In hundreds of different versions of its standard pitch, Trump’s campaign complains, boasts, and beseeches. The President, his surrogates, and the campaign staff spray a familiar buckshot of belittling nicknames and insults at a cast that includes “Sleepy Joe,” “Crazy Bernie,” and “Crooked Hillary,” who were recently joined by “Cheatin’ Obama.” An e-mail on Monday, targeting Biden, asked supporters to “show the Left that you REJECT their corrupt candidate,” while one on Friday called Biden “a certified CROOK.” During a recent “Team Trump Online” broadcast, Parscale bragged about “a roll of Hillary Clinton toilet paper that I use every time I’m in a bad mood. I have boxes of it, and I take it into the bathroom, and it’s just enjoyable.”

Another regular target is the “Lamestream” media, the “enemy of the people,” ever in cahoots with “the Radical Left-wing MOB.” Together, Trump warned in an e-mail earlier this year, these elements are pushing a “non-stop propaganda campaign of LIES to try and destroy me.” With nary a mention of his own wealthy backers, Trump slams “the establishment,” along with the “Hollywood elite” and “foreign enemies,” declaring, in one solicitation, “They all HATE you, and that’s why they want to steal your vote. It’s US against THEM.” The April 27th “Team Trump Online” session was led by Katrina Pierson, a former Tea Party activist, whose guests included Representative Dan Crenshaw, a military veteran from Texas. She described Barack Obama as a “faint-hearted” Commander-in-Chief, while Crenshaw told viewers that Democrats “will lie through their teeth. They’re doing it all the time.”

In its texts and e-mails, the campaign seeks donations and valuable voter contact information by offering a steady supply of Trump-branded merchandise, from football jerseys, Christmas ornaments, and doormats to plastic straws, a swipe at liberal locales that have been banning them to help the environment. The offers have continued unabated during the COVID-19 crisis. Last Saturday, the campaign wrote supporters to say Trump knows that recent weeks have been “extremely difficult for Americans from all across the Nation.” The e-mail said that the President is grateful for “your unwavering support” and wants to do “something special for you to show how much your loyalty means to him.” The message continued, “He’s asked us to give you EXCLUSIVE ACCESS to get our Official Trump-Pence Pint Glasses.” The cost for a set: thirty-one dollars. “But, we have an extremely limited supply, so we can only hold them until 11:59 PM TONIGHT.”

I asked David Sable, the former head of the marketing agency Y. & R., to assess the Trump campaign as a marketing effort. “His base loves it,” said Sable, who explained that Trump has “brand power” derived from what he called the “brand experience,” which is part show, part substance. “The key is to get those people to recruit other people. If you can do that, you’re way ahead of the game. That’s basically the way the guy operates,” Sable said. According to Sable, Trump’s team, to its credit, “understands simplicity.” The “Make America Great Again” message, in 2016, was straightforward, and so is the “Keep America Great” message in 2020, according to Sable: “At the end of the day, I’ve done a great job, I will continue to do a great job, and I will fix this to get back to the great job I was doing.”",1
877,877,1049,"Coronavirus now in 100 Illinois counties as state tops 4K deaths, 90K cases","COVID-19 is now in 100 of Illinois’ 102 counties, as Friday marked the fourth day in a row the state has seen more than 100 lives lost — and the 18th such day since the pandemic began.

With the latest 130 deaths, the state’s toll so far in May alone is 1,727 people, and 4,058 overall.

There were also 2,432 more people who tested positive among the latest batch of 26,565 test results, officials said. And Edgar County became the 100th county to record positive cases in the state.

There have been 90,369 confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic began.

The state’s overall positivity rate — the number of positive cases compared to total tests received within the last 24 hours — was 9.1%. And the Northeast region, home to Chicago, Cook and the collar counties, remained under 20%, a required benchmark to enter the next phase of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s regional reopening plan.

But the positivity rate is a seven-day rolling average and the data lags, Pritzker’s office has said. Each of the state’s four regions must be under that rate for 14 days to advance to the third reopening phase, which allows some “non-essential” businesses to resume limited operations.

The current seven day average of the positivity rate is 12%, Pritzker said, down from an April peak of 23.6%. But the governor warned that part of the reason the positivity rate is lower is because of increased testing.

“Remember, we surpassed 10,000 tests per day for the first time on April 24, and we’ve stayed above 11,000 every day since then. Over the last seven days, we’ve nearly doubled that, with an average of 20,000 tests per day,” Pritzker said. “The good news is that our current statewide positivity rate is under 14% on average for the last 14 days. And that’s likely becoming a better indicator of the true infection rate among the general public than it was when testing was far more limited.”

Pritzker also announced six new testing sites in Chicago, in Little Village, Pullman, Hanson Park, Englewood, Gage Park and Bridgeport.

The state is also launching four new drive-thru sites. Starting Saturday, a drive-thru site in Chatham will begin testing, as well as sites in Champaign, Peoria and Rolling Meadows.

All testing is free, and the sites will be open seven days a week.

Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the head of the Illinois Dept. of Public Health, said as of Thursday night, there were 4,367 people in the state’s hospitals with COVID-19. Of those, about a quarter of them — 1,129 — were in intensive care units, and 675 were on ventilators.

Hospital metrics are also key to Pritzker’s reopening plan. To get to Phase 3, regions must show no overall increase in hospital admissions for COVID-19 symptoms for 28 days, and have at least 14% of ICU beds, medical and surgery beds and ventilators available.

Ezike also issued recommendations for expectant mothers, warning they must be tested for the coronavirus before they’re admitted for delivery.

“First of all, many of the symptoms associated with labor can mimic or cover up symptoms of COVID-19, so we could easily escape detection with just symptom screening,” Ezike said. “But we also know that many people with COVID-19 are completely asymptomatic.

Ezike said early data from hospitals show a positivity rate of between 3% and 12% fo expectant mothers admitted for labor. She said women may be at further risk of additional complications if they have COVID-19.",1

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

1154,1154,1440,Las Vegas' Venetian Resort is taking reservations for a post-coronavirus reopening on June 1,"LAS VEGAS ­– The Venetian Resort is taking reservations for stays starting June 1.

That's the day Las Vegas Sands Corp. expects to open its luxury resort for the first time since COVID-19 shut down the Strip.

The company plans to open its two properties in phases: First the Venetian tower – and then the Palazzo tower at a later date.

“Upon opening, our guests can expect the amenities of a luxury Las Vegas resort including: a full service casino, more than a dozen restaurants, our fully renovated Venetian pool deck and multiple retail outlets,” Venetian Vice President of Public Relations Alyssa Anderson said in a statement.

Las Vegas Sands has required COVID-19 testing for all employees, Anderson said.

While the company anticipates opening on June 1, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak has not ruled out reinstating stricter virus-prevention measures if there’s a spike in new COVID-19 cases or hospitalizations.

Nevada has started the first phase of its COVID-19 recovery plan, softening a mid-March shutdown on certain nonessential businesses. Sisolak has yet to offer a firm timeline for moving on to the second phase of the reopening blueprint.

As hotels plan reopening dates, COVID-19 cases continue to rise in Nevada.

The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state crested 7,000 on Tuesday, increasing to 7,046.

That’s a jump of 140 cases over what was reported Monday, according to new numbers posted to the Nevada Health Alliance dashboard.

The number of deaths in the state remains at 365.",1
271,271,349,Let’s come out of pandemic stronger and more secure,"The COVID-19 crisis is forcing us to confront some harsh realities in America today and should prompt a much broader effort to come out of this troubling chapter in our history stronger, better and more secure. Because, while we are all desperate to get back to normal, normal is not good enough.

Normal is more than two million people behind bars and not nearly enough support for the formerly incarcerated trying to reenter society. Normal is a health care system that leaves millions of Americans uninsured and the rest of us paying more than any other country in the world. Normal is rising sea levels and a retreat from addressing climate change. Normal is a defense budget larger than the combined defense budgets of the next seven countries.

Opinion

Normal is millions of low-income students leaving school without the skills to get a job and millions of college graduates drowning in debt. Normal is a digital divide that denies millions of students and families the same access to technology most of us take for granted. Normal is 100,000 Americans injured or killed with guns each year and school children doing live shooter drills.

Normal is most working people living paycheck to paycheck and unable to cope with a $400 emergency. Normal is limited family leave and no support for child or elder care. Normal is rising substance abuse and declining life expectancy in communities from urban to rural.

Normal is 38 million American households paying too much for a roof overhead and half a million people sleeping on the streets every night. Normal is the top one percent of America having more wealth than the bottom 90 percent and CEO’s earning nearly 300 times more than their employees. Normal is billionaires paying a lower percentage of their income in taxes than their secretaries.

Lawmakers in Washington just passed a $2.2 trillion stimulus that bails out existing companies and small businesses, helps the newly unemployed, and provides some support to state and local governments. There’s also money for the health care industry, checks for working families and the poor, and some relief from student loans.

While these needs are all real in this crisis, that $2.2 trillion of our money will do nothing to change the structural inequities in our society. As an African-American emergency room doctor in Chicago wrote, “To really address the issue of African American health risks in the age of corona virus, we need to acknowledge the root causes.”

Those root causes include racism and discrimination. They include disinvestment in inner-city communities. They include our broken politics that have paralyzed governments and our misguided tax and labor policies that have consolidated wealth and hollowed out the middle class.

As Congress considers additional measures needed to recover from the COVID crisis, let’s think a little harder about the world we want and need rather than the world we have. Let’s imagine a world where incarceration is a last resort rather than the default solution to crime. Let’s imagine a world where guns are kept from people who shouldn’t have them.

Let’s imagine a world where health care and housing are affordable and available to everyone, along with paid family leave, child care and elder care. Let’s imagine a world where on-line learning is accessible to every student who needs it.

Let’s imagine a world where science rather than politics drives our response to climate change. Let’s imagine a world where elected officials are held accountable for misleading us and where they are unable to rig elections with gerrymandering and voter suppression.

Finally, let’s imagine a world where there’s plenty of incentive to work hard and even get rich but there are some common-sense measures in place to ensure that a tiny few can’t capture an obscene amount of the nation’s wealth while the majority of Americans struggle.

In the world we can imagine, shared prosperity is possible by recommitting to the basic middle-class promise: a good job that can support a family, affordable housing, health care and education, and a dignified and secure retirement.

The COVID crisis will be with us for several more months, but the economic fallout will be with us for years, and the underlying inequities will be with us forever if we don’t do something about them. It’s time to seize the moment and create a new normal.

841,841,1010,Trump downplays the need for coronavirus vaccine: 'It'll go away at some point',"President Donald Trump said the U.S. will overcome the coronavirus crisis with or without an effective vaccine, saying that the disease will ""go away at some point"" either way. ""We think we're going to have a vaccine in the pretty near future, and if we do we're going to really be a big step ahead,"" Trump told a reporter Friday at a White House event detailing U.S. efforts to develop a vaccine. ""And if we don't, we're going to be like so many other cases where you had a problem come in, it'll go away at some point, it'll go away,"" Trump said. ""It may flare up and it may not flare up, we'll have to see what happens, but if it does flare up we're going to put out the fire and we'll put it out quickly and efficiently. We've learned a lot."" The president had been asked about his comments earlier in the event, when he said, ""Vaccine or no vaccine, we're back. And we're starting the process. In many cases, they don't have vaccines and a virus or a flu comes and you fight through it."" Trump's remarks downplaying the need for a vaccine came during a Rose Garden announcement unveiling his administration's beefed-up efforts to fast-track the development and distribution of a vaccine for Covid-19. The new project, dubbed ""Operation Warp Speed,"" aims to have hundreds of millions of doses of an effective vaccine available by the end of the year.

Trump formally announced that former pharmaceutical executive Moncef Slaoui and four-star Army Gen. Gustave Perna will help lead the Warp Speed project. Slaoui and Perna both said at the event that they are ""confident"" the operation will be able to achieve its ambitious goals. But Perna acknowledged that it will be a ""Herculean task"" to develop and distribute a vaccine in such a short time frame. It's unclear whether the virus will disappear on its own. Global and U.S. health officials have suggested the virus may be seasonal and relent in the summer before emerging again in the colder seasons. SARS, which emerged in China in 2002 and killed nearly 800 people worldwide, was able to be contained without a vaccine. Health experts, including Trump administration officials, have warned that the virus would likely persist through the fall and could become even more difficult to combat in the winter when flu season picks up. Experts and political leaders alike say that the U.S. won't be able to recover from the pandemic until a vaccine is widely available. Some doubt a vaccine will be ready even within 18 months. Rick Bright, a federal vaccine expert who blew the whistle on the Trump administration after he was removed last month as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, said everything would have to go ""perfectly"" to achieve results in that time. ""We've never seen everything go perfectly,"" Bright said Thursday in testimony before members of a House health subcommittee. ""I still think 12 to 18 months is an aggressive schedule, and I think it's going to take longer than that to do so.""",1

It's powwow season — the time of year when across the country, Native American tribes should be getting together to celebrate their culture with food, dancing, singing and drumming. Kay Oxendine is a member of the Haliwa Saponi Tribe in North Carolina.

""Every year we know it's coming; like, the birds sing differently,"" she told NPR. ""It's almost like spring arrives when the powwow does.""

Oxendine is an author and educator and the mistress of ceremonies for a number of powwows in the eastern U.S. It's a job she loves: telling stories to the crowd and introducing the dancers, singers and drummers. She was set to be the first woman to emcee her tribe's powwow, scheduled for Friday, April 17, to Sunday April 19, at the Tribal Ceremonial Grounds in Hollister, N.C.

About 5,000 people would've been there, but she knew it would be canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. What she says she didn't expect was that her mind and body were still expecting the celebration.

""So I wake up on Friday morning and it's like I wake up and I open my eyes and I'm looking, oh, my God, it's here! Literally was like a kid. And I jumped out of bed, and I'm like YAY, and I said to my son, it's powwow time. And he was like, 'Mom.' ""

She felt physically ill.

""I actually threw up. I actually I got physically ill. It felt like I was pregnant but couldn't give birth.""

Then, she says she noticed on Facebook that a member of the Haliwa Saponi Tribal Council had scheduled a virtual Haliwa powwow. ""And I'm like, man, you know, stop, what are you doing?"" It seemed like such a strange idea.

But she says it was wonderful ""because what she did, she encouraged people to still dress in their regalia. And so one of our previous tribal administrators, Archie Lynch, who is also my cousin, he lit a fire and he was out there and he had sage. He was blessing the grounds. It was in his backyard. But, you know, it just meant the world to me.""

Following the powwow, there's normally an after party with a deejay. This year, one of the tribal members held a virtual after party.

""We were brought up on Otis Redding and soul music around here — music that just makes you want to get up and dance,"" she says.

So Oxendine got up and danced.

""I'm sitting in my room, the music is blasting. I'm sitting in front of my computer, I'm dancing in my living room. My son thinks I've lost my mind. ""

It was just what her spirit needed.

""It was it was just the most beautiful thing I think I've ever encountered. It helped me. It really helped me heal a lot.""",1
749,749,918,FedEx is so slammed with online orders that it's reportedly capping shipments from major retailers like Nordstrom and Hobby Lobby,"FedEx is fielding an unusually high number of online orders.

The parcel giant is limiting how much retailers like Kohl's and Nordstrom can ship, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.

It shows how much store closures from the coronavirus are shifting Americans to online orders, even of nonessential items, and how it's overwhelming delivery giants.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

If your order from Nordstrom, Kohl's, Bed Bath & Beyond, DSW, or Hobby Lobby is moving at an unexpectedly sluggish pace, FedEx may be the reason.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that FedEx is so overwhelmed with online orders that it's capping shipments from some two dozen retailers until at least May 19. The companies whose orders FedEx has capped include Belk, Abercrombie & Fitch, Kohl's, Bed Bath & Beyond, Eddie Bauer, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Hobby Lobby, and DSW.

""These customers have seen significant volume growth since the spread of Covid-19,"" FedEx told Ground workers in a memo leaked to the Journal. ""In a time of already high volume growth, capping the number of packages to be picked up at these locations will limit any negative impacts to the FedEx Ground network.""

A FedEx spokesperson told Business Insider these limits are similar to what the company mandates around Christmas time, ensuring reliable service. The company is working directly with large retailers with unusually-high volume to ensure goods are getting out on time.

Some customers are directly passing their goods to a their closest-by FedEx Ground facility to bypass hub sortation, the spokesperson added. The parcel giant has also increased Sunday delivery, and, in certain locations, hiring.

Americans are now buying (nonessential) stuff online

Earlier this year, Americans shifted to buying household goods, groceries, and essential supplies online. Online sales of hand sanitizer jumped by 228% in the US during the four weeks ending on March 7, compared to the same period last year, according to retail sales tracker Nielsen.

Adobe Analytics said a 100% increase in online grocery orders in mid March drove a 25% uptick in overall online orders, compared to a period earlier in the month.

But as the government-mandated shutdowns from the coronavirus have endured, people are starting to buy more and more of those less essential goods that retailers like Nordstrom or DSW might hawk.

""It went from people trying to stock up and maybe buying a little bit more than they needed to understanding that things are OK, I can move beyond the basics of food and shelter,"" Jaimee Minney, senior vice president of marketing and public relations at market-research firm Rakuten Intelligence, told CNBC.

Rakuten Intelligence found for the first half of April, compared to the first half of March, Americans bought nearly nine times as many books, nearly three times as many toys and games, and more than twice as many sports and outdoors items. Purchases of beauty products upticked by 38%.

Meanwhile, those who are seeing their states reopen may start to consider the ensembles they may need for garden parties or weddings, suggested a recent white paper from Pinterest.

The shift to online is whelming UPS, FedEx, and Amazon

Americans have shifted to ordering more online for years, but the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating that. Sales online popped by 49% in April, according to Adobe Analytics.

And while an unexpected deluge of packages may buoy delivery companies, the FedEx shipping cap shows it's also disruptive to normal business activities. UPS and Amazon have seen disruptions, too.

UPS said it delivered 19% more packages to homebound Americans in the first three months of 2020 compared to last year. But the increase in residential over commercial deliveries ended up eroding UPS' margins.

Meanwhile, Amazon was forced to halt all third-party package shipments last month, and had to ban warehouse deliveries of nonessential goods in March.

Many experts believe that increase will stick. As a result, parcel giants must now piece together how to deliver more boxes on doorsteps than ever before.

""The No. 1 thing that we have seen is an explosion in e-commerce due to the physical store closures,"" Brie Carere, FedEx chief marketing and communications officer, told eMarketer. ""If we thought e-commerce was growing faster before, we're going to see even greater acceleration.""",1
759,759,928,A metrics-obsessed White House struggles to define success on coronavirus,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1

A federal judge has denied a request from Martin Shkreli — the former pharmaceutical executive widely disdained as ""pharma bro"" — to be released from prison so he can work on a coronavirus treatment.

In her ruling Saturday, U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto sided with probation officials who described Shkreli's stated aim of developing a coronavirus cure as the type of ""delusional self-aggrandizing behavior"" that got him his sentence in the first place.

""The court does not find that releasing Mr. Shkreli will protect the public, even though Mr. Shkreli seeks to leverage his experience with pharmaceuticals to help develop a cure for COVID-19 that he would purportedly provide at no cost,"" Matsumoto wrote in the nine-page ruling.

The judge also ruled that Shkreli had failed to demonstrate adequate grounds for release based on compassionate reasons.

""Defendant is a healthy, 37 year old man with no recent history of preexisting medical conditions that place him at higher risk for COVID-19 and its potentially life-threatening adverse effects, and he is confined in a facility where there are currently no cases of COVID-19,"" Matsumoto concluded.

Shkreli entered the public eye in 2015 when, as the then-head of Turing Pharmaceuticals, he purchased the lifesaving HIV drug Daraprim and raised the price from $13.50 a pill to $750 — an increase of more than 5000%. The price-hike quickly cast Shkreli as a combination villain and punchline, the widely-recognized and disliked ""pharma bro.""

Two years later, Shkreli was found guilty of securities fraud stemming from his management of two hedge funds and a separate drug company.

In her ruling, Matsumoto cited the fraud conviction — and Shkreli's public behavior regarding the case — as one of several factors guiding her determination.

""With regard to the nature and circumstances of his offenses, defendant intentionally deceived and manipulated individual and public investors, and before sentencing, made disparaging remarks about the government and the sentencing process that showed little regard for the rule of law,"" the judge said.

Shkreli is currently serving a seven-year sentence.",1
381,381,473,"Post-pandemic recovery depends on ‘a whole new class of jobs’ to help people feel safe in public again, Lightfoot says","Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Tuesday she expects a “whole new class of jobs that didn’t exist before” to be created by the need to reassure people it’s safe to begin congregating in public again.

From mandatory temperature checks to contact tracing, Lightfoot said Chicagoans who have lost jobs during the coronavirus pandemic could find new ones when the twice-extended stay-at-home order is finally lifted.

“There are going to be a whole new class of jobs that didn’t exist before that are gonna be coming out of our thoughts about what recovery and opening up the city looks like,” the mayor said.

“There’s gonna be a whole category of new people that are gonna be working for businesses and buildings. Their job ... is gonna be making sure that people that enter those premises are well. … We’re gonna be able to ultimately employ more people because it’s going to be necessary for us to feel secure coming into congregate settings again.”

Will the new normal require everyone entering City Hall and other government buildings to have their temperature checked?

“We’re looking at a range of options — not just at City Hall, but in businesses across the city … to give people a confidence that they can return to congregate settings and make sure that we’ve got the resources — physically on site — to address any issues,” she said.

“Temperature checks ... [are] certainly one of the things we’re looking at. But we haven’t quite landed yet on what the bundle of options are that we’re gonna adopt at city buildings, including City Hall, and what we’re going to insist [on] as a bare minimum for businesses across the city.”

The mayor vowed to established those “minimum thresholds” in time for what she called a “slow, gradual re-opening, step-by-step” of a Chicago economy that has ground to a virtual halt and will remain so through May.

Earlier this week, City Hall unveiled a new web-based app Chicagoans can use to pre-register for a coronavirus vaccine, get text messages tailored to their symptoms and receive guidance about seeking medical care.

Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady acknowledged the app could ultimately be used as a technology springboard to do contact tracing and said asking registrants how many people live in their households was a “first step.”

On Tuesday, Lightfoot talked again about the conversation she had this week with the mayor of Hamburg, Germany.

The German government is working on a mobile phone app that will “collect information about who you’ve been in contact with, then automatically send out an alert” whenever that person tests positive for the coronavirus, the mayor said.

“That kind of technology would be total game-changer here,” Lightfoot said.

“But in the interim between where we are now and where we get to more technology,” contact tracing will likely require an army of people making calls and banging on doors.

Arwady said contact tracing is already part of the “case investigation” that occurs whenever someone in a long-term care facility or a homeless shelter tests positive for the coronavirus.

But the broader version of contract tracing likely required to re-open the Chicago economy could involve a “community health worker model,” she said.

Health Department epidemiologists could be paired with “folks from communities” that have borne the brunt of the coronavirus in “parts of the city where more people have the kinds of jobs that might take longer to come back,” the commissioner said.

“That’s all dependent on really seeing how some of those resources come down, particularly from the federal level,” Arwady said.

Also during Tuesday’s conference call with City Hall reporters, Lightfoot said she’s “hard at work” on plans for Chicago Park District camps and other summer youth programs and hopes to have guidance for anxious parents shortly.

But, under repeated questioning, she refused to pinpoint the size of the city’s budget shortfall caused by the pandemic.

“We’re not ready because we don’t know the full magnitude of the impact. We never want to put any numbers out and then have to dramatically change them because the world changes,” she said",1
307,307,390,First at-home COVID-19 testing kit authorized by the FDA,"The US Food and Drug Administration has issued the first authorization for an at-home COVID-19 test kit. LabCorp, the diagnostics company producing the tests, says it will give first access to health care workers and first responders.

With this test, people who are eligible can swab their nose to collect a fluid sample, but they will still need to send it to a lab for testing. Self-sampling sidesteps the need for a clinician to perform the test, reducing their exposure to symptomatic patients. It also frees up more personal protective equipment, which is in short supply. The test costs $119.

People taking this test would swirl a cotton swab just inside their nostril. When clinicians take samples for a COVID-19 test, they stick a swab very deep into a patient’s nose, to where the back of their nose meets the top of their throat. Self-administered nose swabs are just as accurate as those more invasive swabbing methods, according to an analysis done by UnitedHealth Group and the Gates Foundation. The FDA started allowing those types of swabs at the end of March, although the agency said they still had to be done under the supervision of a clinician.

A number of biotech startups have created and tried to market at-home tests over the past month, claiming that they’re able to produce them under rules that allow certified labs to design and distribute their own tests. The FDA, though, had said that any test kit that allows people to collect their own samples at home needed additional authorization. The LabCorp test, produced by its consumer-focused testing brand, Pixel, is the first to secure that authorization. The laboratory portion of its test had already been approved for use, but it still relied on samples collected by health care workers. Like all other COVID-19 tests on the market, the FDA authorized this test under its emergency use rules; it hasn’t gone through the normal approval process.

Around 147,000 COVID-19 tests are reported in the United States each day, which experts say is still far lower than the number of tests needed to bring the outbreak under control.",1

A South Korean contract construction worker working at the U.S. military garrison Camp Walker in Daegu — the South Korean city hardest hit by the the coronavirus outbreak — on Monday became the eighth person linked to the U.S. military in that nation to be diagnosed with Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.

""The problem that we found with case number 8 is that he's been sick since last Monday, March 2, and he's been coming through our gates answering our questions falsely,"" said garrison commander Col. Edward Ballanco in a Facebook Live video of the construction worker, who was found to have tested positive last week for Covid-19. ""It's reprehensible, and he will never be coming on post again.""

A U.S. soldier and his wife stationed in South Korea have also tested positive for coronavirus.

All of the approximately 18,000 U.S. Army personnel, both uniformed and civilian, and their families stationed on bases in South Korea received orders Sunday to ""stop movement."" All travel to or from South Korea for those affected is being halted by the order at least until May 6.

The U.S. forces in South Korea have been on high alert for the coronavirus since Feb. 24. There have been more than 7,700 confirmed cases in South Korea.

In Italy, where more than 10,000 cases of the virus have been confirmed — the highest number of cases outside China — a similar ""stop movement"" order was imposed on the more than 4,000 U.S. Army troops and civilians stationed there at three U.S. bases.

Last week a sailor stationed in Naples became the first — and to date, only — member of the U.S. military to test positive for the coronavirus in Italy.

Nearly a quarter-million uniformed and civilian Americans are stationed with the U.S. military in 176 nations, according to the latest Pentagon report, and another 2.7 million work at military installations across the United States.

Many work at or nearby the Pentagon, located in Washington, D.C.

""We're fully confident that we can continue to perform the functions that the Pentagon needs to perform if we have some type of outbreak in the building,"" Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon last Thursday. ""We don't have that yet — knock wood — but we want to be prepared for everything and we're taking a variety of measures.""",1

1050,1050,1246,Coronavirus could push Social Security to insolvency before 2030,"The conservative Heritage Foundation last year panned the bill for “broadening Social Security’s size and scope, raising taxes on all workers, and leaving them with less money to meet their daily needs.”

“This is a very politically problematic situation and Congress, by its very nature, doesn't like dealing with politically problematic situations,” Womack said. “You’re going to have to take a vote to do something to save these programs and it’s going to be very unpopular with a lot of people. It’s probably going to be career-ending for some people.“

But with tens of millions of people out of work, Larson and others think the outbreak could spark a newfound appreciation for Social Security, both as a reliable monthly payment and an economic stabilizer.

“I think it will come out of this pandemic looking really good and that people will value it a lot,” said Alicia Munnell, the director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.

The pressure to find a long-term funding fix will be compounded by the fact that the program serves the population most vulnerable to the virus — older adults, particularly minorities and low-income individuals, Larson noted.

If Democrats win the White House and control a majority of Congress, there could be momentum around proposals to increase benefits, impose the payroll tax on higher-income taxpayers and institute a wealth tax in order to generate more revenue, Auerbach said.

Trump has vowed not to cut Social Security, but Republicans have sought in the past to curb federal spending on the program.

The president is now pushing a payroll tax cut in the next round of pandemic relief, which both Republicans and Democrats worry would harm the social safety net and do little for the tens of millions of people who aren’t collecting a paycheck.

The Trump administration has also considered — and rejected — a plan penned by two conservative scholars that would allow Americans to receive checks of up to $5,000 in exchange for a delay of their Social Security benefits, The Washington Post reported.

White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley said in a statement that “the mere thought of this so-called ‘plan‘ is ludicrous on its face — as President Trump has been clear that while he is in office, the American people can feel secure without a shadow of a doubt that he will completely protect Social Security and Medicare — end of story, full stop.“

Social Security is financed by a 12.4 percent tax on earnings of up to $137,700, with the tax split evenly by employees and their employers. About 40 years ago, Congress set the taxable earnings cap to cover about 90 percent of all wages, with increases annually to reflect average wage growth. But in 2017, the cap only covered 83 percent of earnings, thanks to rising wage inequality and growing health care costs.

Former Vice President Joe Biden has said he would levy the 12.4 percent tax on wages above $400,000 in order to push the program toward solvency.

Even with swift action once the pandemic ends, reforms could take years to implement, Auerbach noted. The federal government’s general fund might have to prop up Social Security’s trust funds at some point, he said.

“Congress won’t be able to come up with any politically palatable changes that produce enough revenue or enough reductions in benefits soon enough to make the system viable over the long-term,” Auerbach said. “So they may need extra money.""

908,908,1082,"Democrats just passed new coronavirus bailout that includes $500 billion to prevent teacher and firefighter layoffs, $1,200 checks for Americans, and a $25,000 pay boost for essential workers","House Democrats passed the HEROES Act Friday, but it's not expected to be taken up in the GOP-controlled Senate.

Without more funding for states, police officers, teachers, and firefighters will face layoffs, Democrats have warned.

The CARES Act contains another round of $1,200 stimulus checks and would give essential workers a $25,000 pay boost.

Senate Republicans say it's too soon to think about the next relief bill but want to pass liability protections for employers.

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

House Democrats on Friday night passed a sweeping, $3 trillion coronavirus rescue package.

The bill, the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or the HEROES Act, spans 1,815 pages and won't become law. Instead, its passage was meant for Democrats to demonstrate their priorities and signal what they will fight for in a later bipartisan bill that could pass in June.

Senate Republicans told Business Insider they think more time should pass before they take up another relief bill so they can analyze the holes in funding from the other four relief packages they've already passed. President Donald Trump signed a $484 billion coronavirus aid bill in late April. The $2 trillion relief bill, known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, became law in late March.

The HEROES Act won't be taken up for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate and Trump has called it ""dead on arrival."" Speaking Thursday night on ""Special Report"" with Fox News' Bret Baier, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the House legislation a ""liberal wish list"" that ""strikes me as hardly salvageable.""

Instead of a funding package, McConnell is preparing a bill to shield employers from federal lawsuits if their customers or workers become sick from the coronavirus. While Democrats have said they are concerned about such changes, they might be willing to negotiate a deal to get some of their provisions from the HEROES Act to Trump's desk.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office published a 71-page summary of the bill, which you can read here. Her office didn't work with the White House to craft the bill and instead encouraged members to ""think big"" for the legislation.

""Families know that hunger doesn't take a pause, not having a job doesn't take a pause, not being able to pay the rent doesn't take a pause,"" Pelosi said during her weekly press conference Thursday about the need to pass another relief bill soon. ""The hardship of it all, losing a loved one or having someone in your family sick, it just doesn't take a pause.""

Below are some of the provisions that were included in the bill:

Nearly $1 trillion for states and local governments

The HEROES Act would set aside $500 billion for states, which are losing out on revenue during the coronavirus lockdowns and also expending more money to fight the virus.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer previously acknowledged the sum was ""an awful lot of money"" but said it was ""essential"" to halt layoffs of police, firefighters, nurses, and teachers. The bill would set aside another $375 billion for cities and other local governments and $20 billion to help territories.

Washington, DC, would receive $755 million. When $150 billion in funds were sent to states under the CARES Act, the capital was treated as a US territory, rather than a state. As a result, it received about $700,000. In contrast, states on average received about $1.2 billion each, Hoyer said.

$25 billion to aid the Postal Service

Democrats want to rescue the US Postal Service with $25 billion in funding. Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, who chairs the committee that oversees the Postal Service, said that without the funding, the agency wouldn't be able to survive beyond a few months.

The HEROES Act would provide an extra $15 million for the Office of the Postal Service Inspector General for oversight of the funding.

$175 billion for healthcare providers

Healthcare providers have already received $175 billion through other relief bills but have said the money won't be enough. The HEROES Act would add another $100 billion for hospitals and medical practices. The sum would go toward both recouping money they spent to fight the coronavirus and making up for the dollars they lost from putting off other medical procedures.

The bill would allow $75 billion to go toward testing and tracing people who may have been infected with the virus, adding to the $25 billion already allocated under previous legislation. The Trump administration would need to come up with a national testing plan and put out an awareness campaign on testing.

More money for people, housing, and food stamps

Under the bill, people would get another $1,200 in relief checks for single filers and $2,400 for joint filers, similar to what they got under the CARES Act.

In addition, people who are laid off would get $600 extra in unemployment benefits a week through January 31. The benefits are set to expire on July 31.

Democrats would increase funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps low-income people buy food, by $10 billion.

The bill would also put aside $100 billion to provide emergency assistance to help low-income renters at risk of homelessness avoid eviction because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

Increasing health-insurance coverage

The HEROES Act would set up a special enrollment period for people who don't have health insurance to sign up for private coverage via Healthcare.gov, where millions of people will get government help paying their premiums. People who lost their jobs in recent months are already eligible to sign up for the coverage, but the change from Democrats would allow others who were already uninsured to enroll.

The bill would open a second opportunity for people to get health-insurance coverage by having the government for nine months subsidize the health insurance people used to get through work. Typically, laid-off workers have to pay the full cost for these plans — under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act — on their own, but the HEROES Act would have the government pick up the full cost of premiums.

Letting more people vote by mail

The HEROES Act would provide $3.6 billion for grants to states for contingency planning, preparation, and resilience of elections, according to a document prepared by Democratic staff on the House Appropriations Committee.

The legislation would also have states set up voting by mail in the November elections so that states could either move to only mail voting or make it easier for people to vote through absentee ballots. Democrats have said this setup would help keep people safe if the US is still in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic at that time.

The CARES Act included $400 million for states to shore up their elections, a sum Democrats say is inadequate.

Giving a raise to 'essential workers'

Democrats want to boost pay for people who are unable to do their jobs from home during the pandemic, including healthcare workers, grocery-store workers, and federal employees.

The bill allocates $200 billion for hazard pay and cites the legislation Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer put forward in April. It would allow frontline workers to get as much as a $25,000 raise through the end of 2020. The amount is equivalent to giving the workers an additional $13 an hour for continuing to work during the pandemic.

$90 billion to help schools and colleges

The bill would set up $90 billion in grants that states can use to help schools with costs, including the cost of mental-health services, cleaning, buying additional technology, and emergency planning. States could also help colleges recoup money they've lost or help professors learn the new technology they need to use to teach remotely.",1
242,242,317,Human Life Is Literally Quieter Due To Coronavirus Lockdown,"Human Life Is Literally Quieter Due To Coronavirus Lockdown

Humans around the world are stuck inside due to the coronavirus. How is the natural world reacting in the absence of all the noise we usually make?

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Life on lockdown inside our homes might be noisy. Outside, the streets and skies are noticeably quieter, and because there's less human sound out there, many people are hearing more wildlife. As Invisibilia's Abby Wendle reports, the relationship between human noise and the rest of nature is often discordant. So is our quiet in this moment having any impact?

ABBY WENDLE, BYLINE: The Internet is humming with rumors of animals reclaiming cities and towns. Dolphins are allegedly swimming in Venetian canals, black bears are supposedly raiding trash cans in LA, and mountain goats have been seen descending the Welsh hills to stroll through town. Some of these quarantine silver lining stories have been debunked, though for now, at least, the goats seem legit. But other anecdotes about nature being more present in the absence of humans come from reliable sources. NPR's own Eleanor Beardsley observed, for the first time in years, birds singing throughout Paris.

ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: But what really blew my mind is I'm sitting by the Seine River right now on a sunny evening, and I just heard a river bird - like, egrets on poles and stuff.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CALLING)

BEARDSLEY: Is that not wild? I have never heard that before.

BERNIE KRAUSE: Yeah. We can hear subtlety of life around us that we haven't heard in a long, long time.

WENDLE: This is Bernie Krause, one of the founders of a field called soundscape ecology that studies how all the sounds in an ecosystem interact with each other and with us. Krause has been recording the natural world for more than 50 years, and in that time he's observed lots of ways our noise is disruptive to wildlife.

KRAUSE: Let's see if I have the frogs and jet flyover.

WENDLE: He tells this one story of how, back in the 1990s, he was recording thousands of frogs that gather in the spring at Mono Lake in California and croak in unison.

(SOUNDBITE OF FROGS CROAKING)

KRAUSE: Notice how they sound really big.

WENDLE: Almost like all the little frogs have joined together to become one giant frog. It's actually a defense mechanism - helps keep predators from locating and attacking individual frogs. But Krause says the military started doing test flights over Mono Basin, and the roar of the jets would cause the frogs to fall out of sync.

(SOUNDBITE OF FROGS CROAKING)

KRAUSE: They would take, like, 45 minutes before they could get in sync again. And during that period of time, we watched as a couple of great horned owls and a coyote came in and picked off a couple of frogs.

WENDLE: Eventually, this led to significant population decline all because of a jet. But Krause says it's not just jets. It's helicopters and chainsaws and tractors and traffic.

KRAUSE: I mean, just endless amounts of noise.

WENDLE: Until now. With billions of people stuck inside, our noise print is dramatically quieter. In Paris, for instance, a group that monitors noise pollution saw as much as a 90% drop in human sounds since the city went on lockdown. So how is this relative quiet impacting wildlife?

MEGAN GALL: There was a question trending on Google. Are birds singing louder?

WENDLE: This is Megan Gall, a sensory ecologist and professor at Vassar College.

GALL: If anything, I would actually guess that the birds are not singing as loud.

WENDLE: That's because, Gall says, they aren't having to compete against human sound, which could be a good thing for the birds.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CALLING)

WENDLE: For one thing, Gall explains, noise has been shown to increase stress hormone responses in birds, which affects immune function. So less noise right now might equal less illness. Plus, birds living in bustling cities or even busy suburban neighborhoods have to expend a lot of energy singing louder. So now that things are quieter, she says the birds might have extra energy to use on different things.

GALL: Like spending time foraging, saving energy to feed your kids, et cetera. So possibly, we'll see animals that have larger broods or healthier offspring. You might also get changes in how females are selecting mates. Now, a lot of that's speculation, of course, but I think there's a lot of really interesting things that could be happening.

WENDLE: While how this all plays out for wildlife is, for the time being, left to informed speculation, one impact of our stillness is ringing clear as a bell.

So the Earth is, like, literally humming underneath of our feet.

ANDY FRASSETTO: That's right. Yep.

WENDLE: Andy Frassetto a seismologist who recently observed, along with colleagues in Brussels and California, a huge drop in human-caused vibrations on the Earth's crust.

FRASSETTO: It was impressive. It was just a reminder that we as a civilization have a noticeable imprint on the world in ways that, sometimes, we don't appreciate.

WENDLE: I, for one, did not appreciate that humans rattle the earth like a tiny earthquake, but we do, mostly from transportation. Automobiles, planes, trains, even our walking registers on seismographs as a kind of constant static. And now that static is way less noisy, giving seismologists a unique opportunity to perhaps detect more subtle vibrations that usually get drowned out, like the ones coming from inside volcanoes close to cities.

FRASSETTO: I think it's an open question how strong this change is, but it's something that I know people in the seismology community are really interested in exploring.

WENDLE: And some scientists are attempting to measure this strange and profound sonic experiment above ground. The Silent Cities project is a call for scientists, journalists, artists, really anyone with good enough audio equipment to record what they're hearing while stuck at home.

AMANDINE GASC: To me, it's very peaceful to walk and, like, able to, like, hear the teeny tiny sounds.

WENDLE: Amandine Gasc is a soundscape ecologist in southern France who helped create the project.

GASC: Like insects moving in leaves, for example, buzzing in the flowers - also, it's spring right now, so it increase also the noise, the wildlife sounds you can hear.

WENDLE: So far, participants are recording at 161 locations all over the world, and the data - an expected 35,000 hours or more of audio - will be available for any researcher who wants to analyze it in the future. Listening to our new sound environment is not just for researchers, though. Ecologist Megan Gall says it can be for everyone.

GALL: One of the potentially positive things that could come out of this is that people are having a chance to interact with the world around them in a way that they maybe haven't interacted with it before.

WENDLE: And those interactions could lead people like Eleanor Beardsley to not only consider the wildlife around them now - the birds singing on the Seine - but help them keep it in mind as things get back to being noisier.

BEARDSLEY: It makes me feel like they're here, and we don't pay attention to them. And we need to because they deserve to have the city as well. It's their land, too.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CALLING)

BEARDSLEY: There he goes. Isn't he cute?

WENDLE: Yes, he is. In this incredibly scary and overwhelming time, he's a refuge.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CALLING)

SHAPIRO: That's Abby Wendle. The new season of NPR's Invisibilia is out now. You can hear it wherever you listen to podcasts.

[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: This report incorrectly refers to Great Basin spadefoot toads at Mono Lake as frogs.]

1024,1024,1220,"Coronavirus deaths in Italy and US could be up to double the official counts, new research shows","The coronavirus pandemic has exposed severe limitations in collecting data during a crisis.

In many countries, limited testing capacity and the difficulty of finding and identifying asymptomatic cases has likely caused many patients to go undiagnosed. COVID-19 tests can also produce false negatives if they aren't administered properly or if a patient isn't shedding enough virus to be detected in a sample.

Some public-health experts have suggested that the actual case totals in Italy and the US could be at least 10 times higher than the current figures. Death counts are likely to be inaccurately low as well.

""There are a lot of deaths that we probably will never know if they were coronavirus deaths or not,"" Elizabeth Halloran, a biostatistician at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, told Business Insider. ""There could be a lot more people infected than we thought.""

Data from the Italian research group Istituto Cattaneo now suggests that the number of coronavirus deaths in Italy was almost double the total reported by the Italian Department of Civil Protection as of April 1.

Data from the US is less complete, but many states have reported spikes in excess deaths that have yet to be attributed to the virus, suggesting that the actual number of coronavirus deaths could be around 30% higher. In some states, total fatalities could be twice the current count.

Italian provinces substantially underreported their outbreaks

To quantify the true number of fatalities in Italy, the Istituto Cattaneo compared the number of reported deaths from February 21 to March 21 to the average number of deaths during that same time period from 2015 to 2019.

According to data from the Italian Department of Civil Protection, Italy saw around 4,800 coronavirus deaths across more than 1,000 municipalities from February to March. But in total, these municipalities recorded 8,700 deaths outside the normal average — meaning thousands of excess deaths have yet to be explained.

In Lombardy, the northern region where Italy's first case was reported, the number of recorded deaths was more than double the average from the past five years. A case study from the Institute of Public Health Berlin and the Italian healthcare network Centro Medico Santagostino corroborates that finding. The research found that only half the deaths reported in Nembro — a municipality in Lombardy — from February 21 to April 11 were categorized as COVID-19 deaths. Yet in March, the municipality saw more deaths than in any single year since 2012; the death count that month was 15 times higher than the monthly average between January 2012 and February 2020.

""Reporting of confirmed COVID-19 specific deaths represents, at least for some Italian regions, a substantial underestimation of the actual number of deaths from the disease,"" the researchers wrote.

Other northern regions, like Emilia-Romagna, Trentino-Alto Adige, and Piedmont, saw their death counts rise by more than 50%, the Istituto Cattaneo found.

Even southern regions outside the epicenter of Italy's crisis saw higher-than-average death counts from February to March. The researchers said one explanation for this could be that many coronavirus deaths occurred in people's homes, and therefore weren't included in the official case counts.

""The impact of coronavirus has spread widely across the Italian population,"" they wrote. ""Substantial increases in mortality are also visible in areas other than those traditionally indicated as coronavirus hotspots.""

The study ultimately concluded that Italy's true coronavirus death toll is nearly double the reported one. Officially, more than 31,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Italy.

US states reported an excess of unexplained deaths this spring

Though it's possible for some flu deaths to be mistakenly identified as the coronavirus, researchers at Harvard and Emory Universities found that the coronavirus has been far deadlier than the flu in terms of reported cases so far. In a new study, they compared the weekly death count for the coronavirus to weekly death counts for seasonal influenza in the US.

""Although officials may say that SARS-CoV-2 is 'just another flu,' this is not true,"" the researchers wrote. ""The demand on hospital resources during the COVID-19 crisis has not occurred before in the US, even during the worst of influenza seasons.""

During the week ending April 21, the study found, the number of reported coronavirus deaths was 20 times higher than influenza deaths reported during the deadliest week of flu season (over a seven-year average). Based on this analysis, the researchers concluded that the current number of COVID-19 deaths might ""substantially understate"" the actual number of fatalities.

""As the CDC continues to revise its COVID-19 counts to account for delays in reporting, the ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths is likely to increase,"" they wrote.

Across many states, the number of reported coronavirus deaths from mid-March through mid-April exceeded the number of typically recorded deaths from all causes during that time frame, a New York Times analysis recently found. Data from 25 states suggests only 40,000 of 55,000 excess deaths have been attributed to the coronavirus so far.

In New Jersey, only half of the excess deaths have been attributed to the coronavirus, suggesting that actual COVID-19 fatalities could be twice as high. The same goes for Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia.

Halloran said some of those unexplained deaths may never factor into the official count.",1
603,603,737,"On Mother’s Day, leaders search for optimism amid pandemic","HOUSTON — As families marked Mother’s Day in a time of social distancing and isolation due to the coronavirus pandemic, leaders balanced optimism they could loosen lockdowns that have left millions unemployed against the threat of a second wave of infections.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin predicted the American economy would rebound in the second half of this year from unemployment rates that rival the Great Depression. Another 3.2 million U.S. workers applied for jobless benefits last week, bringing the total over the last seven weeks to 33.5 million.

“I think you’re going to see a bounce-back from a low standpoint,” said Mnuchin, speaking on “Fox News Sunday.”

But the director of the University of Washington institute that created a White House-endorsed coronavirus model said the moves by states to re-open businesses “will translate into more cases and deaths in 10 days from now.” Dr. Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation said states where cases and deaths are going up more than expected include Illinois, Arizona, Florida and California.

Many families faced their first Mother’s Day without loved ones lost in the pandemic. Others sent good wishes from a safe distance or through phone and video calls.

The virus has caused particular suffering for the elderly, with more than 26,000 deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, according to an Associated Press tally.

At a senior center in Smyrna, Georgia, 73-year-old Mary Washington spoke to her daughter Courtney Crosby and grandchild Sydney Crosby through a window.

In Grafton, West Virginia, where the tradition of Mother’s Day began 112 years ago, the brick building now known as the International Mother’s Day Shrine held its first online-only audience. Anna Jarvis first held a memorial service for her mother and all mothers on the second Sunday of May in 1908.

“Sheltered safely at home with the family together would be viewed by Anna Jarvis as exactly the way she wanted Mother’s Day to be observed,” said Marvin Gelhausen, chairman of the shrine’s board of trustees, in an address on YouTube.

Matilda Cuomo, the mother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, called into her son’s daily briefing so he and his three daughters could wish her a happy Mother’s Day.

“I am so blessed as many mothers today are,” she said.

Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the deadliest hot spot for the virus in the U.S., said he looked forward to getting back to normal. “We’re going to have fun, and then you can spend more time with me. I know I am your favorite,” he said in a playful dig at his siblings.

He also announced two policy reversals a day after an Associated Press report in which residents’ relatives, watchdog groups and politicians from both parties alleged he was not doing enough to counter the surge of deaths in nursing homes, where about 5,300 residents have died. Nursing home staff in New York will now have to undergo COVID-19 tests twice a week and facilities will no longer be required to take in hospital patients who were infected.

The U.S. has seen 1.3 million infections and nearly 80,000 deaths, the most in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, 4 million people have been reported infected and more than 280,000 have died, over half of them in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins.

In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a modest easing of the country’s coronavirus lockdown but urged citizens not to surrender the progress already made. The country has recorded the most virus deaths in Europe at over 31,900.

Those in the construction or manufacturing industries or other jobs that can’t be done at home “should be actively encouraged to go to work” this week, he said. Johnson, who has taken a tougher line after falling ill himself with what he called “this devilish illness,” set a goal of June 1 to begin re-opening schools and shops if the U.K. can control new infections and the transmission rate of each infected person.

“We will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity,” he said. “We’re going to be driven by the science, the data, and public health.”

Germany, which managed to push new infections below 1,000 daily before deciding to loosen restrictions, has seen regional spikes in cases linked to slaughterhouses and nursing homes. Health officials say the number of people each confirmed virus patient infects rose above 1 again, reflecting a renewed increase in cases. The number must be below 1 for outbreaks to decline.

France is letting some younger students go back to school Monday after almost two months out. Attendance won’t be compulsory right away. Residents of some Spanish regions will be able to enjoy limited seating at bars, restaurants and other public places Monday, but Madrid and Barcelona, the country’s largest cities, will remain shut down.

China, where the virus was first detected, reported 14 new cases Sunday, its first double-digit rise in 10 days. Eleven of 12 domestic infections were in the northeastern province of Jilin, prompting authorities to raise the threat level in one of its counties, Shulan, to high risk, just days after downgrading all regions to low risk.

Authorities said the Shulan outbreak originated with a 45-year-old woman who had no recent travel or exposure history but spread it to her husband, three sisters and other relatives. Train services in the county were suspended.

“Epidemic control and prevention is a serious and complicated matter, and local authorities should never be overly optimistic, war-weary or off-guard,” said Jilin Communist Party secretary Bayin Chaolu.

South Korea reported 34 more cases as new infections linked to nightclubs threaten its hard-won gains against the virus. It was the first time that South Korea’s daily infections were above 30 in about a month.

1238,1239,1608,Has the coronavirus crisis depleted your cash savings? Here's what you should do before tapping your 401(k),"Robert Powell

Special to USA TODAY

The coronavirus pandemic has upended the personal finances of millions of workers and their loved ones. And one recent trend is of particular concern.

Many workers who have been furloughed or laid off are now strapped for cash. And they're considering borrowing money from their 401(k) instead of using other sources of funds.

Advisers recommend tapping all other sources of money before borrowing from your 401(k).

“Please stay away from retirement accounts,” says Chris Chen, a certified financial planner with Insight Financial Strategists. “The long-term damage is absolutely horrible.”

The economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which is closing businesses and forcing millions out of work, makes it even less appealing.

“We like to use 401(k) loans as a last resort, especially in a challenging financial environment,” says Dan Galli, a certified financial planner with Daniel J. Galli & Associates.

No match:My company just stopped their 401(k) match. What should I do?

Wall St. vs. Main St.:Here's why the market is better than the economy right now

Reason to avoid 401(k) loans

Galli also advises against 401(k) loans for this reason:

Plan sponsors, according to the IRS, may require an employee to repay the full outstanding balance of a loan if he or she terminates employment or if the plan is terminated. And that could put even more financial stress on your finances if you’re already desperate for living expenses.

Even worse: If you, the employee, are unable to repay the loan, then your employer will treat it as a distribution and report it to the IRS.

“The country is littered with stories about folks that took 401(k) withdrawals with every attempt to pay the money back, but never got around to it,” says Charles Sachs, a certified financial planner with Kaufman Rossin Wealth. “Imagine the lost growth over a 20-, 30- or 40-year period. If people think they have it tough now, they should imagine when they are in their 80s without the benefit of a nice sized 401(k).”

One bit of good news: You, the employee, can avoid the immediate income tax consequences by rolling over all or part of the loan’s outstanding balance to an IRA or eligible retirement plan by the due date for filing the Federal income tax return for the year in which the loan is treated as a distribution.

What to tap instead

So, where might you find money for living expenses? Well, for starters consider that each option has its pros and cons.

But in the main, borrowing from family, a home equity line of credit and credit cards should be used before borrowing from a 401(k), says Galli.

Thomas Scanlon, a certified financial planner with Raymond James, also recommends tapping your Roth IRA. “Your contributions to the Roth IRA can be withdrawn any time, income tax and penalty free,” he says. “This is because the contributions go in after tax.”

If you’re owed a refund, file your 2019 tax return right away. That’s another source of cash, says Rita Cheng, a certified financial planner Blue Ocean Global Wealth. Likewise, follow up on your stimulus check if you haven’t received that yet.

And, for some, accessing the cash value in your life insurance is another source of funds, says Cheng.

You might be able to take a hardship distribution from your 401(k) plan. Typically, it’s allowed for an immediate and heavy financial need, and limited to the amount necessary to satisfy that financial need. But experts generally advise against this tactic. That's because because you will have to pay taxes on the distribution, and you can’t pay the distribution back into your 401(k).

Bottom line: List all your available options and create a plan that will best position you to weather a difficult storm, says David Mullins, a certified financial planner with David Mullins Wealth Management Group.

When a 401(k) loan is the best option

To be fair, a 401(k) loan may be the best option, depending on the expected need and the length of time, and what other options are available. But remember “you are pulling from funds in a down market and missing out on a potential recovery,"" says David Shotwell, a certified financial planner Shotwell Rutter Baer. ""It may be less interest cost, but the long-term cost can be much greater.”

The right way and the wrong way: If you borrow money from your 401(k) plan, there are best practices to follow. When you take a loan, you are selling securities, says Leon LaBrecque, a certified financial planner with Sequoia Financial Advisors. And given that, Robert Braglia, a certified financial planner with American Financial & Tax Strategies, advises against taking the money on a pro-rata basis across all investment options but rather specify which ones, probably cash or bonds, will be sold.

The Cares Act: According to Ed Slott, a CPA with Ed Slott and Company, the CARES Act increases the maximum loan amount for qualified individuals to the lesser of $100,000 (reduced by other outstanding loans) or 100% of the account balance, and, two, allows qualified individuals to take up to $100,000 of penalty-free coronavirus-related IRA and company plan distributions during 2020. If you’re a qualified individual, either the loan or distribution could be a source of funds for living expenses.

1355,1359,1860,China reports zero new Covid-19 cases for FIRST TIME as pandemic finds new ‘epicenter’ in South America,"Beijing has reported no new Covid-19 infections for the first time since the pandemic erupted last year, but as the virus dies out in its original epicenter, South America has quickly emerged as a major hotspot.

China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed zero new cases of the virus on Saturday – a first since the country began tallying infections in January – and reported only two suspected cases, one of them imported from abroad.

Good News! Chinese mainland reports ZERO daily new #COVID19 case! 2 suspected cases reported – 1 imported case in Shanghai and 1 domestic in NE#China's Jilin. pic.twitter.com/6SElh7UxUX — Global Times (@globaltimesnews) May 23, 2020

The lethal illness first emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan, spreading across the country to infect some 84,000 people, killing in excess of 4,600. But with aggressive containment measures that put tens of millions of citizens under strict lockdown, Beijing appears to have largely brought the contagion under control, reporting a only slow trickle of new cases as the virus took hold elsewhere in the world.

While the United States remains the top epicenter with more than 1.6 million infections, South America has quickly overtaken other regions for the number-two spot, with the World Health Organization (WHO) warning of a dramatic spike in cases there.

“In a sense, South America has become a new epicenter for the disease,” Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO's top emergencies expert, told a press conference on Friday, noting that Brazil is “clearly the most affected.”

Also on rt.com ‘Still long way to go’: WHO records BIGGEST single-day increase in new Covid-19 cases

Over the last week in Brazil, health officials have reported tens of thousands of new infections each day, bringing its current disease toll to more than 330,000, rapidly eclipsing Russia as the second-worst-affected nation. Brazil has also counted more than 21,000 fatal cases, nearly seven times more than Peru, the region’s next hardest-hit country.

Though no vaccine, or even a reliable treatment, currently exists for the coronavirus, Brazilian authorities have approved widespread use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a therapy, after receiving shipments of raw materials for the chemical from India last month. The drug has shown early promise as a treatment, but its effectiveness has yet to be proven in a clinical setting. A new study in the Lancet journal, meanwhile, suggests the medicine could cause heart complications and even death, showing little or no benefit to Covid-19 patients.

Since the pandemic broke out last December, more than 5.2 million people have been sickened and some 338,000 killed worldwide, making it one of the deadliest viral outbreaks since the 1918 Spanish Flu.

305,305,388,NIH Panel Recommends Against Drug Combination Promoted By Trump For COVID-19,"NIH Panel Recommends Against Drug Combination Promoted By Trump For COVID-19

Enlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images

A panel of experts convened by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recommends against doctors using a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 patients because of potential toxicities.

""The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was associated with QTc prolongation in patients with COVID-19,"" the panel said.

QTc prolongation increases the risk of sudden cardiac death.

The recommendation against their combined use would seem to fly in the face of comments made by President Trump suggesting the combination might be helpful. On March 21, for example, the president described them in a tweet as having a ""real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.""

He has repeatedly touted the use of the drugs during televised coronavirus task force briefings.

""I think it's not a bad idea to do it, but that's up to the doctors,"" Trump said March 31 before adding the caveat, ""It's going to have to be proven. It's very early.""

On April 5, though, without any more evidence of efficacy, he went further:

""What do you have to lose? And a lot of people are saying that when — and are taking it — if you're a doctor, a nurse, a first responder, a medical person going into hospitals, they say taking it before the fact is good. But what do you have to lose? They say, 'Take it.' I'm not looking at it one way or the other, but we want to get out of this. If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn't do it early. But we have some very good signs. So that's hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.""

As for using the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine alone, the panel said there was ""insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against."" It reached the same conclusion about the drug remdesivir.

The expert panel, convened by the NIH Institute that Dr. Anthony Fauci directs, produced a set of guidelines for doctors to use in treating COVID-19 patients. The panelists come from a variety of health care disciplines. For the most part, the guidelines are agnostic about the use of experimental medications, pointing out that strong scientific evidence is lacking to make a firm conclusion one way or the other.

But occasionally, there are recommendations explicitly against certain therapies. For example, the panel recommended against using Lopinavir/ritonavir or other HIV protease inhibitors because of negative clinical trial data. It also recommended against using interferon because it seemed to make patients with SARS and MERS worse. Those diseases are caused by a coronavirus related to the one causing COVID-19.

""It's all based on the data,"" said panel member Dr. Susan Swindells, a professor in the department of internal medicine at the University of Nebraska College of Medine. ""We just plowed through everything that was, and apart from supportive care, there wasn't anything that was working terribly well.""

The panel also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend any kind of treatment either to prevent infection with the coronavirus or to prevent the progression of symptoms in those who are already infectious. That recommendation could change based on clinical trials presently underway.

Both hydroxychloroquine and convalescent serum are being studied for the possible use for prophylaxis, but the results from those trials are not available. Many of the recommendations aren't terribly surprising. Persons who test positive for the coronavirus but don't have symptoms should self-isolate for seven days after their first positive test.

Patients with mild symptoms should be monitored closely, because more serious symptoms can come on rapidly. Patients with moderate symptoms will likely need hospitalization and supportive therapy. People with severe disease may need oxygen through a cannula, or tube; patients in critical condition may need to be place on a respirator.

The plan is to update the guidelines frequently as new results become available. Swindells said there could be an update about the recommendations regarding remdesivir in the coming week or so.",1
1140,1140,1402,"Enough with the QAnon and 'Liberate' tweets, Mr. Trump. Coronavirus is lethal enough.","Jason Sattler

Opinion columnist

I have no hope that Donald Trump will ever behave like a president of all 50 United States. But I ask one simple thing from him and his son: Please stop trying to get my fellow Americans killed.

It’s impossible to keep track of all the norms Trump is petulantly stomping on as he runs for reelection amid the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression.

As the American death toll from COVID-19 has moved closer to 100,000, he has fired inspector general after inspector general, the only independent watchdogs inside the executive branch. His lawyers have argued before the Supreme Court that this president should essentially be immune from all prosecution and oversight, denying taxpayers the right to know whether he’s even a taxpayer. And @realdonaldtrump has gone into overdrive with his wild tweets and rhetoric, which he has to know could make his more unhinged supporters think he’s hoping they’ll get violent.

And some seem to be getting the message!

Trump's troubling QAnon retweets

Detroit real estate agent Robert Sinclair Tesh has been arraigned on a terrorism charge after he made what authorities determined were credible death threats against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel. We can’t say for sure whether the man behind the alleged threats was a Trump fan. But he does appear to be a fan of the conspiracy theory known as QAnon, having used hashtags associated with the movement.

This arrest ties together two of the most dangerous threads of what rhetoric professor Jennifer Mercieca describes as Trump’s “argument ad baculum” in her forthcoming book, ""Demagogue for President: The Rhetorical Genius of Donald Trump."" These “appeals to the stick,” or implicit threats of force or intimidation, are “used by a demagogue to attack and overwhelm opponents,” Mercieca writes.

Trump has literally incited Michiganders to rise up against their governor with a “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” tweet that former Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord called illegal. And he has cheered on the so-called protesters who’ve garnered national attention by flooding into Michigan’s Capitol brandishing firearms, something you’d never be allowed to do at an NRA convention when Vice President Mike Pence is speaking.

But it’s the connection to the QAnon movement that’s most troubling about this arrest.

While there are always oaky traces of a death cult inside the Republican Party — “pro-lifers” fulminating for unnecessary wars and executions — the calls to sacrifice American (especially older Americans) to “the economy” have become audible as the death toll from COVID-19 has risen.

But QAnon is a literal death cult. It imagines crimes, often cannibalism and pedophilia, that would justify the arrest and even execution of the president's opponents and enemies. And it’s also a domestic terror threat, according to liberal fake news sources such as the FBI.

What Republicans don't get: Donald Trump is our biggest obstacle to coronavirus recovery

Either violent people are attracted to this fantasy — which originally touted Trump as an all-powerful crusader bound to take down international child sex rings and now seems more interested in spreading COVID-19 misinformation to justify Trump’s panoply of failures — or individuals who are into Q just happen to enjoy making criminal threats or killing a family member with a sword.

Of course, the big joke of all this is that Trump is the guy who started a teen beauty pageant, and several former contestants said Trump walked in on them while they were in various states of undress. And the one big name child sex offender this administration has arrested — former Trump playmate Jeffrey Epstein — died mysteriously in the custody of Trump’s Department of Justice, an unresolved crime that stinks of a real conspiracy.

Still, the deluded QAnon cult chugs on as an implicit threat on Trump’s behalf. And the president has rewarded its fealty with at least 131 retweets.

Tickling death cult bone of dad's fans

Anyone paying any attention knows that when Donald Trump Jr. makes a joke about former Vice President Joe Biden being a pedophile, he’s trying to tickle the death cult bone of his dad's fan base. And when Don Jr. pretends to back off by then reiterating the charge, he’s showing that he has learned his daddy’s “I’m not saying; I'm just saying” rhetorical trick of paralipsis.

Mercieca says that's what demagogues use ""to circulate rumors and accusations, to ironically say two things at once, and to build a relationship with supporters.”

I get the desperation.

The Trumps' best attempt at digging up foreign dirt on Biden resulted in impeachment and the revelation that Biden was actually leading the international community’s efforts to fight corruption in Ukraine.

They haven’t found any attack on Biden yet that tanks him the way they smeared a woman for using personal email. And older voters are telling pollsters that they may be abandoning Trump. (Maybe because they’ve heard that some Republicans think they should stop complaining about COVID-19 and start dying.)

Trump impeachment intimidation: Weaponized Twitter feed, die-hard fans who get the 'code'

This is all bound to get more intense as Trump feels the risk of losing the one job in the United States that prevents him from being indicted. The question is how many people the Trumps are willing to take down with them.

The president’s steaming rhetoric may have influenced his superfan Cesar Sayoc, who was convicted of mailing bombs to 13 Trump opponents — including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The only thing that saved us from this Trump fan carrying out one of the worst terror attacks in American history was his incompetence.

But as Trump’s election proved, competence isn’t necessary for success.

So please, Mr. President, stop trying to get us killed. COVID-19 is bad enough on its own.

250,250,325,Blackhawks cancel 2020 fan convention because of coronavirus,"The coronavirus pandemic has nixed the Blackhawks Convention more than three months before the scheduled event.

The Hawks canceled the 13th edition of the event — slated for July 24-26 — on Wednesday, citing the uncertain status of the rest of the 2019-20 NHL season and the advice of public-health officials. Full refunds for previously purchased convention passes and hotel rooms will be issued.

The 2019 convention drew thousands of fans to downtown Chicago for autograph sessions, meet-and-greets, new-player introductions, alumni and front-office panels and numerous other types of programming. It spanned from Friday night through Sunday afternoon, just as this edition was supposed to do.

Illinois’ ban on large gatherings — although it doesn’t extend anywhere near late July yet — theoretically would make the convention impossible. And even if the ban were to be lifted by then, many fans might be reluctant to attend, given the close proximity they would have with thousands of others, leading to attendance concerns.

There’s also a chance the NHL season will resume around that point of the summer, although a plethora of obstacles would lie in the way of that.

If the season does resume, the most likely way would seem to be in a single, neutral-site city, ideally one with relatively few coronavirus cases but with infrastructure sufficient enough to house thousands of players, coaches, league officials, TV crews and more. Even still, the games almost certainly would be held in empty arenas.

So far, cities reportedly under consideration are Grand Forks, North Dakota; Manchester, New Hampshire; and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Grand Forks is home to the University of North Dakota’s hockey facilities. Manchester’s SNHU Arena is the former home of a Kings minor-league affiliate. Saskatoon’s spacious SaskTel Centre typically hosts the Blades of the Western Hockey League.

But the NHL is far away from making any serious commitments to such sites, and little is known about what the format the end of the season would look like. Unless the regular season was resumed or the playoff field was expanded, the Hawks wouldn’t take part.",1
220,220,293,"Remote learning has pitfalls, but we can still help students be successful in this challenging time","Next week, more than 355,000 Chicago Public Schools students will begin remote learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced teachers, students and families to make quick adjustments into new daily roles and routines.

Some families may be undergoing such profound stress that students cannot do any schoolwork at all. For other students, schoolwork may provide some stability and a sense of purpose for their future.

The good news is that even when faced with major disruptions in learning, children are resilient and tend to catch up in skill development to where they would have been, as long as they enter a supportive environment after the disruption. Students who have a smaller gain in learning in one year tend to have a larger gain in the following year.

Opinion

As the district, teachers, and families figure out the strategies that work best for them, there are lessons from research conducted under normal conditions that may be helpful in this unique situation.

Countering the limitations of online Instruction

Research indicates that most students learn better when instruction is in person, rather than online, and students with the lowest achievement seem to benefit least from online classes. Even if online instruction isn’t as effective as face-to-face instruction, it is still effective for most students, and better than no instruction.

One reason students sometimes struggle with online learning is because of a lack of flexibility in what is taught. While online classes are usually self-paced, course content can feel rigid. In a study comparing online to face-to-face algebra credit recovery classes, researchers found that face-to-face teachers adjusted the content of their instruction considerably more than online teachers, even though the online teachers had the technology to be able to offer mini-tutorials and respond directly to students’ questions.

It was easier for the in-person teachers to recognize when students needed help and adapt their instruction accordingly. In fact, when students taking the algebra course online had access to a supportive math teacher in their computer lab, they ended up with similar pass rates as students enrolled in face-to-face versions of the same class.

All of this suggests that online learning places more demands on teachers around intentional communication with students and their caregivers.

Communication among teachers, students, and families is even more critical now

Another downside of online instruction is that it makes two-way communication more cumbersome. Teachers can’t anticipate how all their individual students will respond to instructional tasks, and the feedback they ordinarily get in the classroom as they watch and listen to students engage with the material is vital information for doing their jobs well.

Students feel supported when they believe their teacher knows how they are doing in the class and gives them the support they need to succeed. Without having students in front of them, teachers may not know when they are assigning work that is taking longer than it should to complete and when students feel stuck or overwhelmed. They also will have difficulty recognizing when students are under-challenged or disinterested.

It can be easier for people at home to see whether students need more support, whether work is taking too long, or if students feel under-challenged. To support learning at home, teachers and families need to be in regular communication, whether they have the technology for face-to-face online chats, or are reaching out by phone, group chats, texting, etc.

Even when assignments are not being used for grades, teachers can monitor assignment completion as a signal for who might need help, modifications, resources, or a more personal connection.

Learning is more than test scores — it’s also social and emotional

Brain science has shown that learning has both social and emotional components—people are not computers who can input information and retain it without making an emotional connection and seeing how it fits with their other experiences.

Teachers and caregivers who are supporting learning at home need to talk to students about how they are experiencing the work. Do students believe they can succeed at the task? Do they feel the work is relevant? Do they feel they will learn and grow from the experience?

Students’ confidence that they can succeed at their school assignments, and that the work has value, provides a sense of security and motivation.

What happens in the long-term will matter most

There is no clear roadmap for teachers, parents, and guardians right now. Nobody is going to be perfect in how they are able to support students, even as they all work very hard to do so. The crisis is causing acute immediate stress — from sharing confined space and home technology, to worry about severe financial and health effects on ourselves and others.

There will also be long-term stress from the financial fallout of the crisis and the loss of loved ones. Families will not have all the financial and emotional supports that they did previously, and inequities in education will become more extreme.

Supporting all students ultimately means making preparation so that students have a safe, stable school environment that is responsive to the social-emotional needs of every child when they go back to the classroom.

1036,1036,1232,"6,000 people on what they’re comfortable doing in our new world: A Slate survey.","As the national conversation turns, perhaps prematurely, from flattening the curve to reopening businesses and restarting life, we’re all trying to figure out which parts of normal we’re comfortable resuming. Is it OK to bubble with another family this summer? Is it fine to go to the beach? Is it time to return to the office? When can we have child care again? As we enter this next phase of the coronavirus response, what’s reasonable and what’s not seem more and more determined not by government decree but by who you are, what your circumstances require, and sometimes just by how you feel.

Late last month, we asked readers what they think they’ll be comfortable doing when their city or state lifts stay-at-home orders. In other words: When you’re allowed to do these things, will you? More than 6,100 people responded to the survey, which included questions about getting back to office work and routine errands, child care, dining and entertainment, travel, and interpersonal habits we can’t believe we had to ask about, like hugging.

This survey was designed to identify how Slate readers feel and should not be taken as representative of the U.S. population. But the results did show noteworthy patterns among respondents. A hesitation to resume activities runs deep, though people who identified as Republicans were more willing to get back to normal than those who identified as Democrats, often by margins of 20 to 30 percentage points. Democrats were twice as likely as Republicans to answer a question with “I don’t know.”

Some activities, such as going to movie theaters, shaking hands, or hosting parties, remain a relic of the Before Times. Others, such as going to national parks and visiting the doctor for routine checkups, seem doable to many. Men were more likely than women to pick “yes”—as in, “yes, I will do this thing”—in almost every category. Young people age 18 to 24 were more likely to say yes to getting back to the things they used to do, sometimes by large margins, particularly activities that involve socializing.

Many respondents also wrote in to explain their answers to our questions and elaborate on their feelings. Quite a few parents, such as Dina in California, wrote about their need to get their kids back to day care or school: “It’s just not healthy for any of us. … She gets way too much screen time, and we get no work done. It’s miserable and unsustainable.” Others wrote about the need to visit the doctor, get a haircut, or go back to work—with proper precautions. Will in Alabama notes that some activities might not be a choice: “My ‘Yeses’ are actually ‘Maybe, if I fucking gotta.’ ” Others, such as Gretchen from Arizona, grappled with the uncertainty and anxiety of the future: “All of my ‘I don’t knows’ are the ones that are the most emotional to me. They all seem like they are a bad idea based on the current situation, but I really don’t think I can go an entire year without hugging someone. … My parents are in their 80s, and are out of state, and I don’t want the last time I saw them to be the last time ever!” Below are the results.

Work and Routine Activities

Routine activities and errands—such as returning to the office, shopping at nonessential businesses, and getting a haircut—produced some of the most evenly divided yes and no responses, when compared with questions about kids, travel, and entertainment.

Returning to the office tied with sending kids back to school for the largest amount of uncertainty in the survey, with 20 percent of respondents checking “I don’t know.” Many people wrote that they hoped to keep working from home, some permanently, but others had bosses who’d made it clear that they were eager for employees to get back, or simply had to return for much-needed paychecks.

“I will go back to my job so I can pay rent. Period. I don’t have the option of working from home, so when my store reopens, I’ll be going back.”

—Jessica, California

“The boss of my company has informed us that we will be back in the office in two weeks, as long as the governor doesn’t extend the stay at home order, and it looks like he probably won’t. I’m concerned about it. I share an office with someone, and I’m getting some messaging from my boss about ‘clean desk initiatives’ and sanitation practices, but … if someone is an asymptomatic carrier, we are all sealed in a building getting prolonged exposure to that person, and maybe not knowing about it for weeks. I don’t understand why it’s a rush to get back in the office. We’ve been handling everything working from home.”

—Barbara, Louisiana

“I’m a psychotherapist, so to go back to the office would require me to sit in close proximity to about 20 different people a week for an hour at a time each. … As long as insurance continues to cover telehealth sessions, I will keep doing that for the foreseeable future, even though I absolutely despise doing Zoom therapy—it’s better than the alternative.”

—Marissa, Illinois

“I’m 78, have immunity issues, and have mild COPD. Getting the bug would almost certainly kill me. On the other hand, I need the money I get from working at the local supermarket. It’s going to be a tough call.”

—Norman, New York

“I’m already shopping in person at liquor stores—if I can do the mental gymnastics required to call that essential, I expect I’ll be able to go to a nonessential business like my local bookstore once it opens.”

—Margaret, Massachusetts

“I’m extremely conflicted. Personally, I want to avoid crowds and avoid being in a store where I may try on clothes someone carrying the virus just tried on. However, I’m also a fashion designer. My company, and my job stability, is partially dependent on people returning to stores. How can I want people to shop from the selfish perspective of hopefully keeping my job, while also not wanting to do that myself?”

—Jessica, New York

“It feels stupid dangerous to go to a hair salon, but I really need it for my mental health. I live alone and am getting increasingly depressed. My only coping mechanism is to put the pandemic out of my mind, but I’m reminded every time I look in the mirror or hop on a conference call. I can’t do blond at home, so I’m hoping that if my hairdresser and I both wear masks and are the only ones there, it will be OK.”

—Cece, Tennessee

“It’s insane thinking you can get personal services done like a haircut or mani/pedi while socially distancing! I’m not dying over beauty. I’ll be DIY’ing it until the virus is well under control. And the beauty police can take a hike for judging otherwise.”

—Robyn, Virginia

Our question about resuming routine doctor’s appointments got one of the highest tallies of yeses. It also offered some of the smallest margins among different demographics. Men and women said yes to going to the doctor in nearly equal numbers. It was also the smallest margin between Democrats and Republicans, with 60 percent of Democrats and 74 percent of Republicans saying they would schedule health care appointments. That still leaves plenty who remain apprehensive.

“I’m turning 40 this summer, with a family history of breast cancer, and will need to start getting mammograms. And my son needs to go to the dentist. But what is ‘necessary’ and what is ‘elective’ now?”

—Sarah, Texas

“I have chronic health issues, that while not acutely life-threatening, do significantly impact my quality of life. I was undergoing testing in order to pursue new treatment approaches when my state’s stay-at-home order was issued. It is hard to put those doctor’s appointments on hold when I know I might find a way to feel much better.”

—Breein, Idaho

Many respondents hoped for expanded absentee voting or voting by mail for the remaining primaries and the November general election. But barring that, many swore to vote by any means necessary: “swim through COVID,” “draped in plastic wrap,” and “crawl through clouds of Ebola” were just a few choice phrases respondents used to describe what they would do to vote. One notable finding: While respondents age 18 to 24 were often more likely than their elders to say they’d be comfortable resuming an activity, voting was one place where they backed off. Compared with respondents ages 25 to 65, fewer young people expressed a willingness to vote in person on Election Day. People over 65 were also less willing to venture to the polls.

“I will vote by mail but if not available because Republicans are trying to suppress voting, I will not be disenfranchised. I would rather be dead.”

—Chris, California

“I would want to show ID when I vote in person on Election Day.”

—Charlie, New York

“I would not ‘feel comfortable’ going out to vote in person. I, however, live in Mississippi and have no reason to believe that the officials of this state will make any allowances for voting other than in person. And I will vote.”

—AZ, Mississippi

Child Care

Questions about child care saw some of the thinnest gender gaps, with moms and dads in largely equal numbers wanting to send kids back to day care, school, or camp—or keep them home. Sending kids back to K–12 produced a high level of uncertainty: 20 percent of respondents said they didn’t know whether they’d send their kids if their districts reopened, the same percentage who were unsure about returning to the office. And the two are correlated for many respondents.

“I need some time away from my kids! Either a nanny/babysitter or back in school. I don’t care. I need a break!!!!!”

—Sasha, Maryland

“I wouldn’t send my kids back to day care because … my kid and his day care is bar none the reason I get sick above all others.”

—Graham, California

“I would hire a nanny or babysitter as soon as possible. … I have a newborn and a 6-year-old, and if I don’t get help soon, I see myself spiraling into [postpartum depression]. I would hire someone I trusted who is also following proper social distancing as much as possible.”

—Austin, Missouri

“Once we [send the kids to day care], we may as well do everything else. I am so tempted, because I am struggling so much with my kids, but they are so touchy-feely and unhygienic—if we send them to camp/afterschool we may as well just have a houseparty and bob for apples.”

—Brenan, Illinois

“If my office ‘allows’ us to return to work, I assume that means work from home is no longer allowed. Therefore, I would need some sort of child care, whether I felt it was safe or not. Likewise with school. I don’t have the luxury to choose not to send my children to school if schools reopen.”

—Laura, Illinois

“My high school kid is really struggling to focus in online school, and I’m at work and not able to monitor him. It feels like the same result as if he had dropped out, and I’m worried about his ability to keep up.”

—Meg, Idaho

“The kids need school and activities. My kids are 9 and 5. They have become anxious, lonely, and bored, all of which contribute to more emotional acting out and some noticeable depression (especially in the older child). It is worth the relatively small risk to send them out so that they can be more socially stable.”

—Monica, California

“My daughter has asthma and is high risk. I dread having to send her back to school before a vaccine. I may not, even if schools open. For us, this doesn’t feel theoretical—it’s life or death.”

—Monica, Washington

We also heard from a few teachers who aren’t certain about the prospect of going back.

“When we reopen, I’ll be headed to the school building, even if it’s unsafe. I’m dedicated to the kids and in a low-risk category, so if I get sick it’s likely not the end of the world. I’ll be fighting tooth and nail for safe policies, the right to wear masks (usually we’re not allowed to cover our face or heads at school except for religious reasons), and even if other teachers are relaxing the rules, I’ll be very strict with my students. They deserve to have an education without getting sick and killing their grandparents.”

—Catherine, Washington

“If schools go back in the fall, I have no choice but to be around 1,200 kids and 300 adults a day. I’m terrified, as my partner is autoimmune compromised.”

—Robin, Georgia

Few respondents will be thrilled to send their kids to day camp if allowed, and even fewer were eager to send kids to sleepaway camp. But as with sending kids back to school, many parents are relying on camps to provide summer child care.

“I said yes to a lot of kid-based [survey questions] because working full time and having a 6-year-old has been impossible. I don’t necessarily think these are the safest out of all the things listed, but I need some other form of child care, so I’m willing to take the associated risks. My daughter’s summer camp has confirmed it will run with lots of precautions in place, and I’m planning on sending her.”

—Celia, Colorado

“I don’t know if I would send my child to day camp because I worry about that being a place the virus can spread. They are outside, and that seems safer, but I don’t know that it is a place that is clean—not washing hands enough, touching shared objects. It’s hard to keep kids 6 feet apart. But if I have to go back to work full time, the only other option is sending her away to my sister, who is a teacher and would be off. And I hate the idea of not seeing my child all summer so I can work.”

—Erica, Connecticut

Dining, Entertainment, and Socializing

People age 18 to 24 were more likely than any other age group to say they are comfortable going to a restaurant, to a movie, or on a date. Entertainment-related questions also represented one of the largest gulfs between Democrats and Republicans, with Republicans expressing far more eagerness to resume these activities.

Pretty much everyone prefers outdoor to indoor dining, but there is a real partisan divide when you dig into the numbers. About 71 percent of Republicans are OK with eating outdoors at a restaurant, versus only 34 percent of Democrats; 50 percent of Republicans say “yes” to eating indoors with social distancing measures, while only 13 percent of Democrats say the same.

“I have been craving a meal at a certain Mexican restaurant that has free queso with your chips, a ‘salsa bar,’ margaritas you need two hands to hold, and the best carne asada tacos ever. It seems a small thing, but it makes me salivate to think about after over a month of cooking at home. Also, the restaurant is locally owned and operated, so my money will stay local for sure.”

—Lori, Oklahoma

“As much as I have missed eating out and want to support our local restaurants, I don’t see how they can provide the distancing and cleanliness required. We are a tourist destination with most coming from Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. I am concerned that Georgia and Florida leadership has not taken the situation seriously and thus many tourists from those states could travel here carrying the virus into our restaurants.”

—Geneva, North Carolina

About even numbers would attend a dinner or host a dinner, but no one’s in the mood for a party, with 89 percent of respondents saying no.

“Truthfully, I don’t think I could stand the change in behavior that would be necessary for an in-home dinner party. Every interaction would be so strange—do we just freely pass dishes and wine bottles? Should we not all squeeze onto the couch for a movie night? How do board games work now? My friendships are strong enough to survive the awkwardness and boundaries, but it would be heartbreaking to pull ourselves back from connection again and again.”

—Jess, Colorado

Almost no one wants to go to a movie theater: 91 percent of respondents—the highest tally of the survey—rejected the idea of going to a theater without social distancing policies. And 71 percent of respondents are hesitant to go to the theater even with distancing measures.

“I absolutely live for movies. I’m 74. I have doubts that I will ever attend a movie again, I cannot imagine feeling safe.”

—Penny, Colorado

“I would potentially go to an outdoor concert if it was guaranteed that we would all be really spread out and there were spread-out areas for going to the bathroom so not everyone was clustered around the port-a-potties, or ideally if it was short enough that I wouldn’t need to use the restroom while I was there. And no food or beverage service because people would congregate in line. It would have to be a large venue with capacity capped at a much lower number than usual, or a small neighborhood concert in the park.”

—Kelly, Oregon

“Why not just drink a nice hot cup of Plague Espresso?”

—John, Oregon

Dating showed one of the largest gaps between men and women, with 38 percent of men and 24 percent of women willing to get back to it.

“I’m extremely single, and this experience has made me aware of how much I want a romantic relationship. Realistically, that’s going to require some physical contact at some point.”

—Yana, Pennsylvania

“I think for dates, it is just an acceptable risk for me. I cannot stay inside for forever, and I will let my date decide the level of contact they are comfortable with, but a walk outdoors seems pretty safe to me.”

—Brian, North Carolina

“I feel like dating is so awkward normally. A date right now is just going to be even more awkward. People get so weird in general when you tell them deal breakers early on. I imagine trying to have a convo about social distancing/when you can get close would just bring out everyone’s inner weirdo. I’m busy enough dealing with my own inner weirdo.”

—Brenda, Texas

“To go on a date, I’d need to know more details about the other person’s stance on mitigation/distancing. In some ways it feels like any in-person meetup logistics conversation will sound a bit like a safer sex conversation—what are your risk factors, what are your exposure risks, what are your mitigation practices, do our practices line up?”

—Mary, D.C.

Travel

Many respondents expressed concerns about crowds and only wanted to venture to places close to home. But visiting a beach or national park was one of the more acceptable activities.

“The beach is a big part of our lives. I think we could easily maintain proper social distancing while sitting under an umbrella, tossing a football, and boogie boarding. We have always tended to go to the beach before noon or after 5 p.m. anyway, just to avoid crowds and the hottest part of the day, so we’d continue to do that. It would be a huge boost to our happiness and our ability to sustain social distancing for many more weeks/months.”

—Megan, California

“Despite consistent warnings from the governor, our open space and state park trailheads have been packed. We’ve been avoiding those and will continue to do so, but we might consider doing some backcountry camping in the coming months. Definitely no campgrounds or anywhere with shared facilities.”

—Kathleen, Colorado

“I think this may be an urban/rural divide question. We live out in the sticks right near a national park, and have been going there regularly throughout lock-in. My wife and I rarely see a soul, and when we do, it’s ‘howdy!’ and wave from a distance. If we still lived in L.A.? Definitely would not be going to Venice Beach or Griffith Park, nor to our own park now if there were a bunch of people/cars. Ultimately, it’s situational.”

—Alex, Vermont

“Renting a vacation house just seems unethical right now. We don’t want to unwittingly spread the virus to rural communities just because it would be nice to get away. And going to a beach or national park also seems unnecessary. We’ll be able to do those things again but why expose others, and ourselves, to risk for something so optional?”

—Robin, Wisconsin

“For a rental vacation house, I’m fairly confident in my cleaning skills so would come prepared to clean all surfaces and bring my own linens. I might also rent Saturday but not show up until Sunday to give anything in the air time to settle. And it would have to be in driving distance and not require a stop on the way.”

—Amy, North Carolina

“What’s the point of flying anywhere or staying in a vacation house, other than to meet new and interesting people to breathe on and get breathed on by in return? And isn’t going on vacation an insult to all the people who’ve been sent on involuntary vacation over the past two months?”

—Jess, Texas

“The only reason I say I don’t know rather than no is because I already have a vacation booked for July. They make it so hard to cancel!”

—Belinda, Missouri

“I had to cancel my honeymoon because of the pandemic, and as much as I am itching to get on a trans-Atlantic flight and take a sorely needed vacation, it’s definitely not the first thing I’m doing. I want to be clear of a second wave before I get on a flight.”

—Ben, New York

“My father has been locked down in a nursing home and can no longer work a phone. So, I have to go there and see him in person to assess how he is doing. I could be risking the lives of the entire nursing home and all the workers just because I need to see my ailing father. This is a horrible Sophie’s choice, and I really should not do it, but I know I will.”

—Mark, Texas

“I am terrified to visit my 86-year-old grandmother. We just lost my grandfather in December of 2019. Now not only can we not visit her, but she is also alone for the first time in 60 years. It breaks my heart that she is alone and sad. The idea of losing Gram is terrifying, so I am staying away.”

—Melissa, Montana

“My mother is 91 (and a half!) years old and lives in a different state. We had to cancel our trip to see her in April. The last thing I want to do is go visit her and carry the virus to her, in which case she would likely die from it. … But let’s face it, at her age every day is a gift, and I don’t want to put off visiting her for so long that she dies in the next year while I wait for a vaccine, meaning I would never see her alive again.”

—Susan, California

Physical Contact

Shaking hands elicited one of the most decisive responses. Nearly 90 percent of respondents said no to handshaking, and many called the tradition “outdated” and “gross” and hoped the pandemic would hasten its demise. Hugging was the single largest divide among age groups: 65 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds said they would hug friends, compared with 36 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds, 27 percent of 45- to 54-year-olds, and 16 percent of 65- to 74-year-olds. About one-fifth of respondents said they were unsure about hugging a friend.

“I think I will really miss shaking hands, but it’s not always necessary and just seems like both an unnecessary risk and an easy way to protect someone else.”

—Sean, Ohio

“Shaking hands, screw it, dumb tradition. Just hit ‘em with the curtsy before they can offer and see what they do. Or, if you’re truly second level, give them the extended-hand ‘psyche’ and hair brush-back. Frankly, that should be the new normal.”

—Russell, Kentucky

“I’m unsure about shaking hands, as I had a [tradesman] come over who held out his hand, and I shook it before I thought about it. Habit? I felt rude not doing it, though I would have preferred not to.”

—Annmarie, Texas

“I’m fine with never shaking hands again, but damn, I don’t think I can live without hugs.”

—Emily, Washington

“I desperately need a hug. I’m grieving the loss of my husband and dealing with my mom’s severe illness. I’m willing to risk a hug with a close friend if they are willing to risk it with me.”

—Lori, California

“I want so very much to hug and kiss my 90-year-old mom, but I would never forgive myself if she became sick.”

—Heidi, Washington

“Hug a friend—I don’t care if it’s risky. I know it is. But I love my friends, and I miss them, and want to hug them.”

—Xan, Pennsylvania

1111,1111,1345,John Oliver Warns That Resuming Sports Might Be More Complicated Than It Seems,"John Oliver turned to the world of sports on Sunday’s episode of Last Week Tonight, examining how wrestling, mixed martial arts, baseball, and others are planning to come back amid a global pandemic. “One of the things that sport does best is to bring people together in times of crisis,” he said. “Unfortunately, though, bringing people together is the exact thing we should not be doing right now.” Oliver broke down the flaws in various strategies for athletes returning to work—except for marble racing, a sport as thrilling as it is social distance–friendly.

At the mention of wrestling, Oliver was unable to resist the chance to invite Adam Driver to “chokeslam me to hell, you nasty shed.” He also took a pause to reflect on his ongoing obsession with Driver, wondering whether he’s bothered by Oliver’s continued sexualization of him through over-the-top, masochistic come-ons each week and musing that the actor might even have grounds to sue. “To which I say: Do it. Slap a restraining order on me, you forlorn block. Beg me to stop, you menacing obstacle.”",1
1164,1164,1451,Florida’s Coronavirus Dashboard Architect: I Was Fired for Not Manipulating Data,"A top Florida Department of Health data manager alleges she was forced to resign from her job maintaining the state’s COVID-19 portal because she refused to change data that would “drum up support for the plan to reopen” amid the pandemic.

Rebekah Jones, the architect behind the Sunshine State’s interactive COVID-19 dashboard once praised by the White House, told several news outlets on Tuesday she was removed from her position as Graphic Information Systems manager on May 5 due to “reasons beyond my division’s control.” On Monday, the state’s Department of Health offered her a settlement with the option to resign instead of being fired, which would go into effect on May 26, she said.

Jones, 30, told CBS12 News that her involuntary removal came one day after she refused to “manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.” The scientist, however, did not elaborate on which data in particular she refused to alter.

States Are Starting to Reopen Amid the Coronavirus Pandemic. Here Are Their Plans.

To date, nearly 2,000 Floridians have died and 46,442 have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Despite the ongoing public health issue, Gov. Ron Desantis announced last week his plan to open up Florida’s virus-stricken economy.

The news of Jones’ ouster was first revealed in a May 5 farewell email she sent to researchers and members of the public who signed up to receive updates on the data portal. In the email, Jones said her department was no longer responsible for updating information on the site “in any shape or form.”

“As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months. After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it,” Jones wrote. “They are making a lot of changes. I would advise being diligent in your respective uses of this data.”

The COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard provides daily updates on the numbers of deaths, new cases, and tests for every county in the state. Seen as one of the leading trackers in the state, the portal is heavily relied upon by officials, academics, and residents as Florida moves toward restarting the economy three months after issuing a stay-at-home order.

According to internal emails obtained by the Tampa Bay Times, reporters contacted the department on May 4 about a field of data that showed when residents first began to report their virus symptoms or testing positive. The data, according to the emails, showed that Floridians were experiencing symptoms as early as Jan. 1—three months earlier than when the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the state.

‘Hopefully, The Virus Is Dying in That Room’: A New York Nurse Bids Farewell to a Coronavirus ICU

That field of data vanished from the portal several hours later, the Times reported. Then, at around 5 p.m. on May 5, Department of Health I.T. Director Craig Curry messaged Jones asking her to “disable the ability to export data” from the interactive COVID-19 site.

“Per Dr. Blackmore, disable the ability to export the data to files from the dashboard immediately,” Curry wrote, referring to Dr. Carina Blackmore, the director of the Division of Disease Control and Health Protection in Florida. “We need to ensure that dates (date fields) in all objects match their counterpart on the PDF line list published.”

Minutes later, Jones responded saying “this is the wrong call” before complying with the request. About an hour later, at 6 p.m. on May 5, the I.T. director emailed both Jones and Blackmore asking them to “re-enable” the ability to export data “for now.”

The Florida Department of Health did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment.

“Allegations that Florida’s government may have tried to manipulate or alter data to make reopening appear safer is outrageous. These kinds of actions are dangerous and, frankly, should be criminal,” Terrie Rizzo, chair of the Florida Democratic Party, said in a Tuesday statement to The Daily Beast. “An independent investigation into these allegations is needed immediately. Meanwhile, city and state officials across Florida should closely monitor the situation to protect the public’s health.”",1
973,973,1166,The Riddle of Solitude in the Age of the Coronavirus,"For six weeks during the late winter of 1989, I had a cabin in the woods to call my own. It stood in a small clearing just off a muddy road: one room that contained almost all a writer needed then—a scratched table in front of a window, a rocking chair beside a fireplace, a bookcase, a dictionary, a thesaurus, a teakettle. I’d arrived at the MacDowell Colony, an artists’ residency in Peterborough, New Hampshire, which had been supporting writers, composers, painters, and sculptors since 1906. That winter, there were about fifteen of us in cabins scattered through the woods. We could visit each other—the kettle came with two cups—but not without an expressed invitation. Solitude had its rules. Most days, I kept to myself.

Each evening, I walked half a mile to our communal dinner, the quiet magnifying every sound: the door shutting behind me, my footfalls crunching on the frozen road. One of the things I loved was the sense of safety I felt in the darkening woods. I kept track of the moon. I scanned the sky for Venus and the first glimmerings of Orion. Often, my work still filled my head and, as I emerged from the pines into the open field and saw the bright lights of the dining room in the distance, I felt as if I had to break through a pane of glass to join in. Even so, I loved the intimacy of that meal with others. I’d quickly learned to identify one novelist’s laugh, and to expect a certain painter’s smell of woodsmoke. We gossiped and swapped stories, etching rumor into myth: the woman who had chained herself to her desk in a desperate attempt to stay, a man who fled the quiet—or maybe the trees? Looking back now, I marvel at how quickly a feeling of community took hold, abetted, I’m guessing, by our common purpose, our separateness from our usual lives, and the solitude of our days.

Residencies like MacDowell are often described as “retreats,” which implies a welcome escape from life, or a withdrawal. But those six weeks meant far more to me. I was in my early thirties, and just beginning my serious attempts at writing, working in snatched time in the hours before my day jobs in bookstores and commercial kitchens. The quiet and solitude of my time at MacDowell was an inquiry into a life I wanted to lead, and a challenge. What was I going to do with all that time and space? Since then, in many ways, I’ve sought to build my life around the possibilities I discovered in that cabin, to carve out a world for thought, spending most of each day working in a quiet I built for myself. I came to feel at home in my solitude, having made peace with the way it isn’t predictably stable—with how I’d sometimes slip into it easily, at other times pacing in it, stalked by a restlessness that took effort to shake. I could anticipate its changing textures: the welcome intensity of it after coming home from a day of obligations, its starkness after the departure of a friend.

I live in a modest-sized Maine town and, when our library closed, back in mid-March, I began to isolate myself in earnest. At first, daily life didn’t feel all that different to me. The outside world was just a little quieter, muffled as though it were a Sunday in deep winter. I settled into work as usual, and even welcomed the greater stillness, which seemed to enlarge the sense of spaciousness in my home. But as the pandemic unfolded, and the days became more and more freighted with the unknown, the solitude I’d worked so long to establish began to feel threatened by something I can’t quite name. I began to realize just how much my solitude had existed within a larger web that I could see and hear and feel. Now, as I go through the familiar motions of routine in an altered world, I find myself conscious of absences, especially of the sounds that filtered in behind me as I worked—morning traffic, neighbors walking their dogs, children chattering on their way to the school at the end of the street—which marked the patterns of other people’s days, and defined my life, too.

This new solitude feels lean and hard. As I move deeper into it, I worry that it will replace all the subtle textures of the solitude into which I’ve grown over the last thirty years. And, hard as it is, I’m not sure where its borders lie. What is prudent and what is foolish. What must be endured, what can’t be endured. When it might end. Back in late March, once the snow melted away, I put out two lawn chairs, six feet apart, thinking that I’d have a friend over now and again; they could bring their own tea in a thermos, I thought, or a beer. But after a few weeks, as the daffodils began to show a little color, that didn’t seem like such a good idea. So, I closed up the gap in the chairs, just to look out on something resembling the normal spring in my yard. Several days ago, dreaming of change, I spaced them apart again.

Before I went to MacDowell, my hopes about writing felt like a secret. I’d published a handful of poems in literary journals; if I’d stopped writing, few would have cared, and my parents would have been relieved. I was living outside of Boston with housemates, I was scrambling just to pay the rent. My dream of solitude was a simple one, naïve: I just wanted to be left alone to write. To have the time. In the quiet and space of that cabin in the woods, I got a glimpse of what a writing life would ask of me. As the days went on, I began feeling more ambitious for my work. I had time to try new ideas, to make mistakes and muddle things up. I spent untold hours nosing around, guessing, reading, trying to discern shape, making peace with waste and second thoughts. I’m not sure anymore how much I actually accomplished—it would take another four or five years for me to finish my first book—but I still remember the tenor of those hours, all my own. The spare space grew increasingly intimate and personal, even though I had brought so little with me: a bag of clothes, a box of books, a radio, my typewriter. I can still hear the tapping, and feel the pressure of my fingers on its keys. When I struggled with restlessness, I walked in the woods or turned on the radio and let unfamiliar voices in.

That world quickly came to feel like my real life, and on the last day of my residency, as I slowly packed up my things, returning the studio to its blank possibility, I was stunned by how quickly all sense of my presence dissipated. Driving home, spring advanced as I made my way south. Winter trees reddened; moss was bright on the stone walls. It was as though, in less than two hours, I had travelled through an entire season, and the world I returned to seemed cluttered with what I’d left behind. I certainly wasn’t much good in the kitchen on my first days back at work, and I knew the few hours I had to write were no longer going to be enough.",1
630,630,770,Twitter introducing new labels for tweets with misleading COVID-19 information,"Twitter is introducing new labels to mark tweets with COVID-19-related misinformation, the company announced today. The labels should make it easier tell if a tweet has a misleading or unverified claim and point you toward resources about COVID-19.

The new labels will link to a page curated by Twitter or to an “external trusted source” that can provide information about the claims made in the tweet, according to Twitter. Here’s what the new labels look like:

Twitter may also apply a warning onto a tweet if it conflicts with COVID-19 guidance from public health experts. That warning will cover the tweet with a message from Twitter, and to see the actual tweet, you’ll need to specifically click into it. Here is what that warning looks like:

The company also laid out a rubric for how it will evaluate taking action on a tweet with false or misleading content across three different categories and based on the tweet’s “propensity for harm.” Here’s that rubric:

Twitter started applying a new label to tweets “containing synthetic and manipulated media” as of February of this year. Twitter has also pledged to remove misleading COVID-19-related tweets that could incite people to engage in what it deems “harmful activity.”",1
600,600,734,Bill Gates Offers Nigerian House of Reps $10 Million Bribe for Speedy Passage of Compulsory Coronavirus Vaccine Bill – Citizens Threaten Action to Stop It,"by Samson Atekojo Usman

Daily Post

Excerpts:

The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), on Monday (May 4, 2020), alleged that it has intercepted a human intelligence report that the Nigeria House of Representatives leadership was poised to forcefully pass the compulsory vaccine bill without subjecting it to the traditions of legislative proceedings.

In a statement issued and signed by the spokesperson of the opposition political parties, Barrister Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere and sent to DAILY POST in Abuja on Monday, the body urged lawmakers in the lower chamber to rise against impunity.

The body in the statement alleged that a sum of $10 million was offered by the American Computer Czar, Bill Gates to influence the speedy passage of the bill without recourse to legislative public hearing, a development they averted as anachronistic, adding that the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila should be impeached if he forces the bill on members.

The statement read:

“Opposition Coalition (CUPP) has intercepted very credible intelligence and hereby alerts Nigerians of plans by the leadership of the House of Representatives led by Femi Gbajabiamila to forcefully and without adherence to the rules of lawmaking to pass the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill 2020 otherwise known as the Compulsory Vaccination Bill which is proposing a compulsory vaccination of all Nigerians even when the vaccines have not been discovered. “This intelligence is coupled with the information of the alleged receipt, from sources outside the country but very interested in the Bill, of the sum of $10 million by the sponsors and promoters of the Bill to distribute among lawmakers to ensure a smooth passage of the Bill. “The Nigeria opposition rejects the Bill and urges opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives to confront the Speaker of the House with these facts tomorrow at plenary and resist every plan to illegally pass the Bill. “We have been informed that the alleged deal on the passage of the Bill was struck during a trip to Austria a few months back while the financial support for the promotion of the Bill was allegedly received last week to mobilize for a push leading to the hurried attempt to pass the Bill by any means necessary. “Nigerians are reminded that at present, there is no discovered/approved vaccine anywhere in the world and one now begins to wonder why the hurry to pass a Bill for a compulsory vaccine when there is none. “What if the world eventually does not find a vaccine or cure for coronavirus just like it has not found a cure for HIV AIDS? What is the hurry in passing a Bill based on speculation or is there anything else the leadership of the House would want to tell Nigerians? Is this bill what will stop the mass deaths and infections rising in Lagos, Kano, Abuja, Gombe, Borno, Kaduna, Ogun, Bauchi and indeed all over the country? “Is this Bill going to revive and grow the economy and reduce hunger and give us more testing kits or bed spaces? Is this Bill going to stop the stealing of palliatives meant for poor and vulnerable Nigerians? Is it true that all these noises for the Bill is all for the alleged $10 million? “Why make a law for a vaccine that has not been discovered? Does it mean that Femi Gbajabiamila and the promoters have an idea of the vaccine and when it will be ready? When nations like Madagascar are making local remedies which is working, APC is making a law to compulsorily inject Nigerians with vaccines our former slave masters have not yet discovered. “The plan to push the passing of the bill is evil.” “The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC did not make any contributions to the drafting of the Bill and has even told Femi Gbajabiamila to suspend the Bill as the timing is very wrong but Mr. Gbajabiamila believes he can secure the silence and acquiescence of the NCDC with all the illegal powers been provided for the NCDC in the Bill hence he still wants to push ahead with it the passage. “We are saying loudly again and calling on House of Representatives to suspend this Control of Infectious Diseases Bill and await for proper input and scrutiny after the pandemic and charge all efforts towards giving the needed support to reduce the spread and find a homegrown solution.”

Infectious Diseases Bill: Nigerian youths blow hurt, reveal what will happen to lawmakers

By John Owen Nwachukwu

Daily Post

Excerpts:

Youth leaders across the country, under the aegis of the Coalition Against Vaccine Trial in Nigeria, CAVTIN, have issued a stern warning to the leadership of the National Assembly over the controversial ‘Control of Infectious Diseases Bill.’

The youths threatened to embark on all actions that are within legal means to ensure that the bill is not passed.

They also threatened to start a recall process of all the lawmakers involved in the attempt to pass the Bill.

The Coalition wondered why the House of Representatives, without warning and with malevolent alacrity, could engage in a plot to push through what it described as a very contentious and troubling bill.

The Bill was sponsored by the Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, and two other members: Dr. Paschal Chigozie Obi, member representing Ideato North /Ideato South Federal constituency of Imo State and Rep. Sununu Tanko Yusuf, member representing Yauri/Shanga/Ngaski Federal Constituency of Kebbi State.

In a statement signed by Alhaji Aliyu Buba Amshi, North East; Segun Onibiyo, Secretary, Vanguards Of Democracy North Central; Ibrahim Bunu, Middle Belt Patriotic Front; Nze Ugo-Akpe Onwuka (OYI), International Coordinator – Igbo Renaissance Forum (IRF) South East; Sammy Brown, President, Supreme Council Of Ibibio Youths, South South; and Eric Oluwole, Yoruba National Youth Leader; South West, the Coalition said:

“One begins to wonder why the lightning speed to get the bill passed without being dully scrutinized by honorable members of the House, who incidentally were not presented with copies of the Wonder BILL. “As if that was not enough, while the citizens were still trying to grasp the movie-like actions playing out, the same controversial bill seeking to repeal the Quarantine Act 2004 sponsored by the House of Representatives, surfaced at the Senate on Tuesday the 5th of May, 2020, under a different title which read ‘National Health Emergency Bill, 2020’,” the Coalition noted.” “We wish to state without equivocation that no matter the nomenclature of the bill, we shall resist it unless Nigerians are adequately educated and sensitized about the benefits of giving such unfettered powers to the Nigeria Centre For Disease Control (NCDC), which includes forcible administering of the COVID-19 vaccine.” “We, however, want to know if the vaccine trial has passed Phase 1- 3 before we jumped into offering our citizens as guinea pigs.” “Does Nigeria have the experience and capacity to run a candidate trial? “We are not going to sound nice nor complementary in presenting our feelings about the unfortunate games that we see being played with the lives of Nigerians at this very critical time, when COVID – 19 and hardship occasioned by the unplanned lockdown action has brought upon the citizens.” “We are by this publication putting the government on notice that Nigerians would not be led to the slaughter like sheep, and citizens cannot to be used as guinea pigs for vaccine trials.” “We shall resist any attempts by any individual, group of persons or organizations that would want to begin vaccine trials of any kind without first of all going through the right protocols and sensitizing the citizenry.”

The youth leaders declared that these uncommunicative gymnastics, change of document title and sleight of mouth to throw dust in the eyes of the citizens was dead on arrival.

Infectious Disease Bill: ‘Why the rush’ – Christian leaders blast Nigerian lawmakers

By Wale Odunsi

The Daily Post

Excerpts:

The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has kicked against the bill on Infectious Disease Control before the House of Representatives.

CAN, in a statement on Tuesday by General Secretary, Joseph Daramola, queried “the rush” to allow the bill to be passed into law with jet speed.

“The question in the hearts of many people is this: Why the rush when the vaccine is not available yet?,” they quipped.

The Christian leadership gave reasons it was against the moves by the Nigerian lawmakers.

CAN said the bill:

“was initiated to destroy the Civil and Human Rights of Nigerians; that it prevents Nigerians from having a say in their own affairs.” “Among this denial of the fundamental human rights are: right to life, personal liberty, freedom from inhuman treatment, privacy, right to acquire/own property, freedom of movement and religion.” “These rights are held sacred and invaluable except on clearly defined occasions as provided for by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”

CAN reminded the federal legislators that the courts in Nigeria, on numerous occasions, struck out Acts of Parliaments and Legislation including Executive Orders of Governments, that were against fundamental human rights.

The body told them to:

“allow the Spirit of God to prevail over the primordial intentions and ambition; not to pass this controversial, nebulous and obnoxious bill into law in the overall interest of Nigerians”.

1254,1255,1651,Wylie mayor defends belief that women shouldn’t lead public prayer,"Wylie Mayor Eric Hogue says he believes women can do “anything and everything” — so long as they don’t lead public displays of religion.

Hogue is defending his beliefs after the release of an email in which he requests that only male members of a Christian missionary group say a prayer before a City Council meeting.

The exchange between Hogue and the city’s mayor pro tem, Jeff Forrester, was posted Wednesday on a Facebook page that focuses on the city’s politics.

Forrester emailed Hogue last week about the group, Youth With a Mission, asking for the mayor’s thoughts about arranging for its members to attend the council’s next meeting.

On Sunday, Hogue replied, saying it was a good idea — as long as “those leading the public prayer be young men.”

Wylie Mayor Eric Hogue sent the email to Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Forrester on Sunday. ((custom credit))

Hogue, who also is the minister of Wylie’s Cottonwood Church of Christ, quoted two New Testament verses he said he interprets literally.

The first, 1 Corinthians 14:34-35, says: “Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.”

The mayor also quoted a passage from 1 Timothy that says, “Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.”

Hogue wrote that he has always asked for men to lead invocation, while acknowledging that “not everyone may agree with me, but I can’t go against my conscience.”

Hogue did not respond to a request for comment from The Dallas Morning News, but he spoke to local television stations about the email, telling KXAS-TV (NBC5) that his belief extends only to public acts of religion.

“What I will say is a woman can do absolutely anything and everything — but if we’re in a public setting, in a religious setting, the Bible teaches that she’s not to say a public prayer or to lead the singing or to deliver the sermon,” he said.

He reiterated that to WFAA-TV (Channel 8), saying, “I believe a lady can be president of the United States. I believe a lady can be CEO of a company, the superintendent of a school district.” But in the Church of Christ, he said, women don’t lead worship services or singing — only classes for women and children.

Hogue also pointed to his 33-year marriage as a sign of his respect for women.

“My wife would not stick around if I was anti, you know, like that,” he told WFAA. “I mean, we are equal partners in everything.”

Forrester told WFAA he doesn’t share the mayor’s beliefs and was surprised by the email, but he added, “I’ve never observed Mayor Hogue ever speak ill of women.”

Hogue, 56, has been Wylie’s mayor for 12 years and is not seeking re-election this year. In addition to leading the church, he is a professional magician and formerly performed as a clown named Clinky.

Hogue told NBC5 that he suspects the outcry over his email may be motivated by politics after this month’s election was moved to November because of the coronavirus pandemic.

“I think the main thing is the budget cycle is coming up, and they would like to have the new council in place,"" he said. “I totally get that, but we are living through a pandemic.”

Coronavirus will change the healthcare industry forever, and we must be there for nurses in the aftermath.

Nurses have banded together to develop a successful COVID-19 playbook to effectively combat it on the frontlines.

But with that will come long-term health impacts, and we should establish wellness opportunities to assist their recovery.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

There are defining moments in all of our lives — moments that have the ability to fundamentally alter a person, process, and organization. COVID-19 is one of those moments. And, if we have learned anything from this crisis, it is how truly awe-inspiring the strength of our combined team members can be when faced with the unknown.

Our nurses, and others, have endured unique war-like circumstances since the first week in March. One confirmed case turned into a thousand within mere days. Empathic and compassionate caregivers were turned into combatants who had to face ""the invisible enemy."" Our response was courageous, having to put aside our fears for ourselves and our loved ones, to answer the call to action. Ingenuity, creativity, and fortitude forced us to think differently and change care models as patient statuses rapidly deteriorated. Had our team members not been there, the numbers of casualties would have been far greater, which can't be underscored enough.

This newfound sense of camaraderie has made us stronger, with an enhanced ability to move swiftly and adapt to ever-changing situations.

COVID-19's playbook continues to be written by nursing teams throughout the continuum of care. When the patients present in the emergency department, we are now able to distinguish the early signs and differences between the coronavirus and the flu. We know how to treat less severe cases, advising them when to return to hospitals if their condition worsens. We know which respiratory treatments work, how they should be delivered, and how often. We also know that proning patients can be the difference between intubation and regular oxygen.

Unfortunately, we've been conditioned to the dramatic, intense, and long workdays. But even the hardest of situations come to an end. We've turned a corner and entered a stage where each ""code"" called overheard during the pandemic's early days has been replaced by chiming bells for a patient who was extubated, or hearing The Beatles' ""Here Comes the Sun"" when patients are discharged.

Distress has transitioned into perseverance, evidenced in the smiling eyes visible through a nurse's mask as they line our hallways to celebrate key moments in this fight. This is what resilience and hope looks like.

The stark truth is that nurses won't come out of this unscathed. We already have a greater appreciation for humanity and the fragility of life. Empathy and compassion have not changed. Neither has our mission. But what will be the pandemic's final toll on nurses?

During times of decompression and reflection, fears, anxieties, and concerns will arise. There will be physical and mental health issues, too, both of which need to be quickly identified and remedied. We need to establish tranquility and wellness opportunities for our nurses, and provide them with avenues to talk about what they are feeling and ensure them that they are not alone. We need to support these valiant team members just as they have been there for our patients and the community throughout this crisis.

I couldn't be prouder of our frontline team and how our nurses have responded. Through the chaos and uncertainty, caring and compassion never failed. We've been on both sides of recovery and unfortunate death. It's been heart-touching and heart-breaking all in the same breath.

We can only hope we don't have to do it again.

1155,1155,1442,Sales soar at Walmart and Home Depot during the pandemic,"On the other side of the spectrum: Kohl’s. The department store chain posted a 41 percent drop revenue for the quarter, offering a stark reminder of how the pandemic is boosting some retailers while hastening the demise of others.



Consumer spending has dropped precipitously in the weeks since the pandemic took hold. U.S. retail sales fell a record 8.3 percent in March, then plunged 16.4 percent in April, according to Commerce Department data, as Americans stopped spending on clothing, furniture, housewares and other nonessentials.



Retailers temporarily closed more than 260,000 stores because of the coronavirus outbreak, all but bringing business to a halt for many companies that rely on in-store shoppers to drive the bulk of their sales. Four major retailers — J. Crew, Neiman Marcus, Stage Stores and J.C. Penney — have filed for bankruptcy this month, and analysts say they expect others to follow as more companies run out of cash and the economy continues to sour.

Pier 1, which had filed for bankruptcy weeks before the shutdowns, announced Tuesday it would cease operations altogether. It had planned to closed 450 of its 936 stores and shed 40 percent of its workforce and find a buyer, but the pandemic ended those hopes.



“It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy: the bigger, stronger players are taking even more market share,” said Mickey Chadha, senior credit officer at the rating agency Moody’s. “And the companies that were weak to begin with, they are only going to become weaker.”



But spending on groceries has continued to climb. Walmart, the country’s largest grocer, said profits rose 4 percent, to $3.99 billion, during the first quarter. Demand has been so brisk that Walmart has hired more than 235,000 workers since mid-March, according to chief executive Doug McMillon. All 5,355 of the company’s U.S. stores have remained open during the pandemic.

“More than ever, the news this quarter is our amazing associates,” he said in a statement. “They are rising to the challenge to serve our customers and our communities.”



But worker advocacy groups say the company’s gains have come at the risk of employees’ health. At least 22 Walmart employees have died from covid-related complications since March, according to labor advocacy group United for Respect.

Walmart said it is providing free masks and gloves to employees and has installed sneeze guards at its checkouts. It has also announced two rounds of bonuses — $150 for part-time workers, $300 for full-timers — who work through the pandemic. It said it spent nearly $900 million on employee bonuses and other covid-related costs.



The retail giant also announced Tuesday that it is discontinuing the e-commerce site Jet.com “due to the continued strength of the Walmart brand.” Walmart paid $3.3 billion for Jet.com in 2016 and continued to invest heavily in the site in hopes that it would help win over younger, more affluent, big-city shoppers from Amazon. (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)



Home Depot, meanwhile, said sales at U.S. stores open at least one year rose nearly 8 percent. Profits fell nearly 12 percent to $2.25 billion, as the company spent more on wages and cleaning stores.

“Although the pandemic has shrouded the retail world in gloom, Home Depot’s results are something of a bright spot,” Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.



That was not the case at Kohl’s, which was one of thousands of retailers that shut its stores and furloughed the majority of its workers in March. The department store chain posted $541 million quarterly loss, compared with a $62 million profit in the same period last year.



“Kohl’s results show the extent of the damage the pandemic has caused to nonessential retailers,” Saunders said. Though he said a number of factors worked in the company’s favor, including its focus on fitness apparel and the location of its stores in strip centers instead of shopping malls, “the toll on the financial health of Kohl’s should not be underestimated.”

“If a reasonably well positioned retailer like Kohl’s is posting such bad numbers, it does not bode at all well for much weaker players in the market,” he said.",1

Enlarge this image toggle caption Greg Baker/AFP via Getty Images Greg Baker/AFP via Getty Images

Updated on Friday at 7:36 p.m. ET

Most of the nation's airlines are beginning to require passengers to wear face coverings or masks on flights to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Southwest and Alaska Airlines announced Friday they will join American, Delta, United, Frontier and JetBlue in taking the action amid growing pressure from Congress and their own employees.

Flight attendants having been calling on their airlines and the federal government to require face coverings or masks on passengers since the pandemic began, and in recent weeks, some Democratic lawmakers have been urging the same, ramping up pressure on the Trump administration and the airlines to do more to protect travelers and employees from COVID-19.

The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents employees of United, Alaska, Frontier and 17 other airlines, says at least 300 of its members have contracted COVID-19 and several flight attendants have died. The union continues to call on the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services to mandate face coverings be worn by all travelers on flights and in airports.

The FAA has said it expects airlines to follow CDC recommendations that everyone wear face coverings when in public, but the regulatory agency has stopped short of requiring them.

Some airlines already require crew members to wear masks, and in addition to now requiring passengers to do the same, some airlines are blocking out middle seats, spacing out passengers during boarding and taking other steps to ensure social distancing on flights. They've stepped up their cleaning and disinfecting of airplane cabins, as well.

JetBlue was the first U.S. airline to require passengers to wear face masks, starting next week. ""Wearing a face covering isn't about protecting yourself, it's about protecting those around you,"" said JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty. ""This is the new flying etiquette.""

United and several other airlines will provide masks to those passengers who do not have them.

Asked why his airline didn't act sooner when the flight attendants union had been calling for such step for over a month, United Airlines spokesman Josh Earnest said it was a supply chain issue.

""We did not want to be in a position in which we are diverting medical supplies that were badly needed for medical professionals,"" Earnest said. ""Now that there is more inventory, we have been able to work through our supply chain to ensure that we can provide our customers with masks on May 4,"" when the new requirement takes effect.

Earnest would not say if the airline will deny boarding to passengers who refuse to wear a mask.

""We will be providing masks to all of our customers"" to make it easy for them to comply, he said. ""We do have language in our contract of carriage that will be updated, so we're going to be real clear about what the requirements are.""

Earnest added that social norms are changing to the new coronavirus realities, ""and I think those changing norms will carry over into the social environment on board an aircraft.""

Delta will make masks mandatory on Monday, too. Frontier's requirement goes into effect May 8, and American will require passengers to wear masks as of May 11.",1
459,459,564,The Cubs have seen it all over the years — and that’s just on the second day of May,"Of all the dates in the history of the Chicago Cubs, May 2 is one of them.

I know. Try to hold on to your hats after that explosive opening sentence.

Look, the Cubs have been around since Methuselah. Any date on the calendar is rich with history about their exploits, many of them not so wonderful.

But there’s something about May 2 . . .

Where to start? On this date in 1917, Cubs lefty Hippo Vaughn threw a nine-inning no-hitter against the Reds at Weeghman Park, which eventually would become Wrigley Field. One slight problem: Reds righty Fred Toney also threw a no-hitter, and his lasted for 10 innings. Indeed, the Cubs lost, in the only double-no-no of its kind ever.

On this date in 1956, Cubs third baseman Don Hoak struck out six times against the New York Giants at Wrigley. It remains tied in the big-league record book for the most strikeouts in a single game — only Hoak made his achievement extra special by fanning against six different Giants pitchers. Sure, it took him 17 innings to make all that magic happen, but the man was determined.

But this isn’t all about bad outcomes, in case you were beginning to wonder. May 2 has seen, for one thing, a bunch of walk-off winners by the Cubs at Wrigley.

In 1958, they beat the Milwaukee Braves 8-7 on Walt Moryn’s ninth-inning homer. Official attendance that day: 5,751.

Two years later, the Cubs gave up three runs to the Phillies in the top of the ninth, falling behind 7-5. But they responded with three of their own, winning the game when Don Zimmer knocked home Ernie Banks with a single to center. Attendance: 2,807.

In 1978, the Wrigley ramps were darn near overrun by an official crowd of — wait for it — 6,990. When Manny Trillo doubled off the Dodgers’ Mike Garman to score Rudy Meoli with the game-winner in the ninth . . . bedlam, we’re sure.

Maybe, just maybe, there was even more excitement on the second of May in 1998, when 38,430 cheered as Sammy Sosa doubled to deep left off Kent Bottenfield with two outs in the ninth to score Mark Grace from first and defeat the rival Cardinals.

Could we look back on most any day from April into September and find moments like these? Perhaps. But try telling that to the great Billy Williams, who on May 2, 1961, went 4-for-4 with a grand slam against the Giants. You can bet he still remembers a day that fine, and probably many more folks than were actually in the puny crowd of 3,334 claimed to be there to witness it.

In 1976, the Cubs won each game of a doubleheader at San Francisco in extra innings — the teams played 14 and 11, respectively. And not only that, but the games ended with identical scores of 6-5. What a crazy turn of events that was.

But the man who drove home the winning run in the second game of that doubleheader — terrific Cub Randy Hundley — couldn’t recall that at-bat when reached this week at his home in Palatine. For the record, it was a pinch-hit sacrifice fly off Greg Minton that scored Dave Rosello.

“I sure don’t,” Hundley said. “But I wasn’t playing much by then anyway. My legs were giving out on me.”

It’s true. That was the very last RBI of Hundley’s career.

Hundley, now 78, sure wishes he could be watching baseball now. He rarely misses a Cubs game in person or, more often, on TV. In non-pandemic times, mind you.

“This virus is something incredible, isn’t it?” he said. “Who would’ve ever thought of such a thing?”

Who could’ve imagined it, say, one year ago today? Last May 2, the Cubs were off after winning four straight on the road against the Diamondbacks and Mariners. A day later, they’d begin a three-game sweep of the first-place Cardinals at Wrigley, by the end of which the Cubs would have a half-game lead in the division. The Cubs would remain atop for the remainder of the month.

On that pleasant note, hey, enjoy the rest of your May 2. And be ready — you never know what might happen.",1

The five lawmakers who voted against the package included one Democrat — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — and four Republicans — Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Jody Hice of Georgia, Ken Buck of Colorado and Thomas Massie of Kentucky.

""We have our differences, but we are coming together on this particular bill, and I am proud of that,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who made the case for ongoing, robust federal intervention as the only way out of the crisis. Pelosi on Thursday wore a white scarf to cover her face, but lowered it to speak on the House floor.

""I think that we have to do whatever we can to recognize that public policy has a role here, that governance carries with it responsibilities and opportunity and results and progress for the American people,"" she said. ""And that science and governance are the answers to meeting the health care needs and meeting the needs of our economy as we go forward.""

The Senate passed the measure by unanimous consent on Tuesday.

The details

The $484 billion package includes an additional $321 billion for the newly created Paycheck Protection Program, a lending program designed to help small businesses stay afloat with forgivable loans during the crisis. PPP was popular and ran out of its initial influx of $350 billion in just two weeks. It is likely the program will need additional funding. Republicans have criticized Democrats for holding up the bill — initially a stand-alone $250 billion request to fund PPP.

In the end, Democrats secured an additional $60 billion carved out for smaller banks to assist businesses, many minority-owned, that have struggled to borrow from bigger lenders. It also includes $100 billion Democrats sought for hospitals and more testing.

They were unsuccessful, however, in their efforts to include additional resources for state and local governments — a fight they vowed to carry on to the next round of funding talks.

""There will not be another bill without state and local government"" resources in it,"" Pelosi said on Friday.

Social distancing during votes

The House debate on Thursday included stark images reflective of the time: House Chaplain Patrick Conroy delivered the opening prayer wearing a yellow mask, as did most lawmakers and aides who appeared in the chamber. The visitors' galleries, normally open to the public, were closed.

It was the first roll call vote in the House since it approved a prior coronavirus relief bill on March 14. After that vote, two lawmakers fell ill and about a dozen others self-quarantined as a result. One of those quarantined members, Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., later tested positive for COVID-19. House leaders installed more aggressive social distancing guidelines for today's votes.

""We should be mindful of the people surrounding us,"" said House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who is leading an ongoing effort to find ways to allow lawmakers to vote and hold hearings remotely.

Members were directed to vote in smaller groups broken down by alphabetical order for each vote. Between floor speeches and votes, lawmakers were asked to stay in their offices. And members were asked to vote by machine and not a manual card that requires more contact. Short recesses were held between debates and votes to clean the chamber.

The pandemic also continues to affect lawmakers personally. Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., announced on the House floor that her sister is hospitalized with COVID-19. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced that her eldest brother died from the virus on Tuesday.

Next up

This is the fourth measure Congress has approved since March 1 to confront coronavirus and the economic fallout. While all four enjoyed fast, bipartisan support, there are signals that the parties are retreating to more familiar partisan lines for an anticipated fifth package.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he wants a ""pause"" before Congress considers additional legislation, and that it is unlikely additional measures will be able to pass the Senate by unanimous consent, which is generally reserved for noncontroversial bills. He has also indicated he will oppose any no-strings-attached funding for states and that he supports a new legal channel for states to declare bankruptcy to address their fiscal woes.

Among the measures Congress is expected to debate for inclusion in future legislation is funding for state and local governments to make up for budget shortfalls, additional cash payments to American workers and families, extended unemployment benefits, aid for the U.S. Postal Service and first responders, and new infrastructure spending.",1
329,329,418,Watching out for Illinois’ most vulnerable kids becomes all the harder during a pandemic,"The novel coronavirus had disproportionally impacted some of our most vulnerable communities including seniors, people with health conditions, the poor, and minorities including African-Americans.

But how is it impacting at-risk children who are in the custody of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services? How has DCFS been handing the crisis?

Opinion

First, the good news. Overall, DCFS has been doing a good job handling this unprecedented situation. These are some of the positive steps DCFS has taken:

DCFS has given guidance to its private agency partners, and has done so in a transparent manner. Every directive and protocol related to COVID-19 is collected in a prominent location on DCFS’s website.

About 85% of DCFS’s operations are being conducted remotely. This includes remote interviews of children, foster parents and other care providers. Even operators at DCFS’s child abuse hotline are handling calls remotely, from their homes.

DCFS is giving foster parents $100 supplemental payments for March and April, for a total of $200, due to the additional costs of caring for children who are at home instead of in school.

A coalition of advocates urged DCFS to provide services to assist youth and young adults who have recently “aged out” of DCFS or are about to age out. These youth, many of whom have special needs, are particularly vulnerable for loss of wages, mental health issues and homelessness. DCFS is extending services to these youth including assistance with housing, food, unemployment, mental health and medical care and casework support.

DCFS was scheduled to rollout a problematic managed care plan for all medical care for the 17,000 children in its care, many of whom have complex medical needs, on April 1. The rollout in February for 19,000 children who were formerly in DCFS care — children who have been adopted or are in subsidized guardianship — was a disaster, with some 2,500 children being dropped from their health coverage for up to a week and many other problems. DCFS agreed to delay the managed care rollout indefinitely due to COVID-19.

Although there is good news in DCFS’s handling of the pandemic, there’s a lot to be worried about:

Calls to DCFS’s child abuse hotline dropped by more than 50% since the shelter-in-place order went into effect. Yet there is every reason to believe that incidents of child abuse and domestic violence are up with families hunkered down and isolated at home under stressors that are associated with increased incidents of abuse such as worries about work, money, and health.

DCFS’s move to remote interviews of children was necessary to protect children, families, foster parents, DCFS personnel and the public. But remote interviews, especially of young children about sensitive topics such as abuse and neglect, are not as effective as live interactions. It’s just not possible to pick up on all of the child’s subtle body language and facial expressions. It’s also more difficult to monitor whether someone in the next room is coaching the child.

Most concerning, all of the systemic problems plaguing DCFS for years haven’t gone into abeyance because of the crisis. As just one example, DCFS is managing the coronavirus crisis with the sever shortage of placements for children that existed before. As a result, children continue to languish needlessly in out-of-state placements, in what are supposed to be emergency short-term shelters, and in locked psychiatric hospitals long after they are ready to be discharged, just like before the crisis. Only now it is far more difficult to monitor these children.

Regarding children who are in out-of-state placements, even before sheltering-in-place measures and remote interviews, it was difficult if not impossible to properly monitor these children and the quality of the faraway placements. In addition, even before sheltering in place, it was difficult to support visits with siblings, parents, and other family members in these faraway placements.

Regarding children languishing in locked psychiatric hospitals for weeks and months after they are ready for discharge, in addition to being antithetical to the children’s civil rights, these children are needlessly in congregate care settings with shift staff coming and going and new patients coming and going. These children are thus at needless increased risk of COVID-19 infection. This is a result of DCFS’s dangerous shortage of placements, a problem that DCFS has known about for years and which has gotten much worse over the past five years, during which DCFS lost hundreds of placements.

While DCFS has been doing an admirable job during the crisis, DCFS is operating under the many and severe systemic problems that existed before. Most all organizations, under these unprecedented circumstances, are understandably not running on all cylinders. But if they started with eight fully-charged cylinders, there are hopefully redundancies if a cylinder goes out. Unfortunately, before the pandemic started, DCFS was chocking along on only a few cylinders.

Children, like other vulnerable populations, will be disproportionally impacted by this crisis. When the crisis is behind us, Illinois must commit to meaningful reform of DCFS. Children are our most important asset, and they deserve better.

SUMMARY: Four months later, the US coronavirus response is still one of the worst in the world. How to follow this bizarre presidential campaign. That armed protest in Michigan makes the ""reopen"" movement look thuggish and dumb. Turns out, ""Groundhog Day"" is a horror movie. The most popular stories on Insider this morning...

A few months in, the US coronavirus response is still one of the worst in the world

Back in January, the United States and South Korea each identified their first confirmed coronavirus case on the same day.

South Korea responded immediately and competently, by testing, tracing, and isolating cases and getting ahead of the epidemic.

The United States, meanwhile, initially denied that the virus was a threat, blew its first attempt to roll out tests, and then never marshaled the strong federal response that could have slowed the outbreak before it really got rolling.

Three months later, here's where things stand.

South Korea is close to exterminating the virus:

The US has, finally, after about six weeks of half-hearted lockdowns, ""flattened the curve."" But the US is still confirming about 30,000 cases a day — with the true number of cases likely far higher. The US is behind where it needs to be on testing and tracing capacity and lacks a clear strategy for isolating cases and protecting the most vulnerable.

The tragic result of the US's poor response is the highest number of fatalities in the world. More than 63,000 Americans have died, and counting. As a chart of ""deaths per million"" shows, the US has company in this grim statistic: The UK, Spain, Italy, and other countries were similarly blindsided and slow to react. But a glance at South Korea shows what could have been.

So, what's the outlook from here?

As pressure and frustration about lockdowns build, the US is starting to reopen. The frustration is understandable: The pandemic has clobbered our economy and upended our lives. But without a strong testing-tasting-and-isolation response—or a more sophisticated and optimized set of restrictions—""shelter-in-place"" lockdowns have been our most effective tactic. Most experts think the reopening move is premature and will likely lead to a reacceleration of outbreaks in some areas of the country.

The US has ramped testing capacity, but is still far behind where it needs to be. The US is now doing a little more than 200,000 tests per day, but experts believe it needs to be doing many times more. Experts also estimate that the US will need to hire as many as 300,000 contact tracers to interview everyone who has a confirmed case, figure out who they interacted with, and warn and test them. And, because the coronavirus transmits easily within the home, the US also needs to develop a clear isolation and quarantine approach.

US states and cities can and must execute much of this strategy. But they need federal money, resources, and leadership to do it. Alas, the US still lacks a strong, competent federal response.

Our best hope is that infections slow sharply, testing and tracing capacity continues to increase, and we discover strong drugs and treatments before the fall flu season. Otherwise, we'll be living with this pandemic well into next year and beyond. —HB

How to follow this strange presidential campaign

""This never happened"": On Friday morning Joe Biden denied Tara Reade's accusation that he sexually assaulted her in the early 1990s, capping a chaotic week in the 2020 presidential campaign, during which:

And that was just this week!

The 2020 presidential election takes place six months from Sunday, so we're at the start of what promises to be one of the strangest political seasons in American history. The pandemic has played 52-card pickup with the campaign—the Democratic primaries more-or-less called off, the Democratic nominee campaigning from his basement, the conventions on the brink of cancellation, Election Day itself at risk, the presumed campaign issues—strong economy, impeachment, corruption, immigration—made obsolete by the COVID-19 catastrophe.

This disarray and uncertainty mean that we're going to have to follow this campaign differently than we have in the past. The 2020 race will not have traditional campaign events, so a lot of the natural color of the campaign will vanish. The overwhelming nature of the pandemic and the economic collapse will flummox traditional forecasting tools. Instead, the election will likely boil down to three key questions. These, not all the swirl, are what to pay attention to in coming months.

First, how much blame and credit is Trump getting for the pandemic, the economic collapse, and any potential rebound? How much is he being held responsible for whatever direction the country seems to be going in November?

Second, is Biden a credible candidate, or will he be seriously damaged by either the Reade accusation or something else? Depending on where we are with question one, he doesn't have to be good, just barely viable, to defeat Trump

Third, and most importantly: Instead of looking at polls, look at the mechanics of voting. The variable impact of the pandemic — and how partisan state officials respond to that — could cause vast differences in how the election actually takes place in different states. It may matter less which candidate has strong support in a state than how that state is conducting its election — by mail or in person, in the midst of an outbreak or during a quiet time, with more open polling stations or fewer. — DP

Armed protest in the Michigan statehouse diminishes the reopen movement

A militia group with no political affiliation from Michigan stands in front of the Governors office after protesters occupied the state capitol building during a vote to approve the extension of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's emergency declaration/stay-at-home order due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, at the state capitol in Lansing, Michigan Seth Herald/Reuters

Yesterday's protest in Michigan represented a new, disturbing development in the reopen movement. The peaceful crowd that swarmed the lobby of the state capitol, protesting the ongoing state of emergency, included at least half-a-dozen heavily armed men.

Michigan law permits open-carry even inside the state capitol (though not on the legislative floor), so the men were breaking no laws. Still, the images of them occupying the public galleries above the lobby were disturbing: Some Michigan legislators wore bulletproof vests as they entered the building.

The armed display distorts a critical public debate. The display in a state capitol — in the place built for peaceful, civil debate — warps the work legislators need to do, and overlays it with menace. You can't argue with a loaded gun.

It's also worth asking whether those praising these armed protesters would have responded the same way had a group of African-American men, similarly armed, done the same thing. —DP

Enlarge this image toggle caption Al Pereira/Getty Images Al Pereira/Getty Images

Updated at 11:31 p.m. ET

The Tony Award-winning American playwright Terrence McNally has died of complications related to COVID-19. He died Tuesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Fla. at age 81. McNally was a lung cancer survivor who lived with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

His work on Kiss of the Spider Woman, Love! Valor! Compassion!, Master Class and Ragtime won him a string of Tonys in the 1990s. He also won a lifetime achievement Tony last year. In all, McNally's body of work encompassed some four dozen plays and musicals, many of which went to Broadway.

McNally was born Nov. 3, 1938 in St. Petersburg, Fla., and grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas, before attending Columbia University in New York. (In a 2002 interview with the school, he professed not to know how he had graduated, saying: ""I went to the theater so much."")

McNally was a crucial voice in illuminating the lives of LGBT people in the United States; in 1995, the New York Times marveled that his ""proudly gay play"" Love! Valor! Compassion! became a mainstream Broadway hit.

In a 2019 interview, he told Playbill he was ""tone-deaf,"" but that he also considered himself to be a musical person. Certainly, much of his stage work — whether writing books for musicals or, in the case of Master Class, creating a theatrical portrait of opera legend Maria Callas — was an expression of his deep love of music. He also wrote the librettos for two operas by composer Jake Heggie: Great Scott and Dead Man Walking.

In a 2003 interview with WHYY's Fresh Air, composer John Kander — who, alongside lyricist Fred Ebb, collaborated with McNally on several shows, including Kiss of the Spider Woman — called him a gracious co-creator. ""[McNally] is very good at writing a scene that has five pages in it that he knows perfectly well we're going to steal and musicalize,"" Kander said, ""but where he will let a character go on in dialogue in a way which is probably unnatural for him emotionally to do. And he does that in order to turn Fred and me on to musicalizing it.""

Among his other awards were an Emmy, two Guggenheim Fellowships, four Drama Desk Awards, two Obies and an induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.",1
1300,1303,1741,"It is ‘not safe’ for England’s schools to reopen on June 1, former UK chief scientific adviser’s group warns","A group of top scientists led by a former UK government chief scientific adviser has warned against reopening English schools on June 1, saying it is too soon for kids to return to classrooms safely amid the threat of Covid-19.

A report published by the 'Independent Sage' committee, chaired by Sir David King, says that “well-functioning local test, trace, and isolate protocols” – key conditions for the UK government to relax lockdown restrictions – will not be in place by the start of June.

Until [the protocols] are, it is not safe to open schools on June 1.

New modelling shows that the risk to pupils would be halved if UK ministers delayed their proposed school opening date by two weeks, allowing more time for an effective “test, trace and isolate” program to be established, according to the science committee.

The UK government is due to publish scientific evidence on Friday from its own official SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) committee, which is underpinning its plan to allow primary schools to reopen in a safe manner.

PM Boris Johnson told MPs in the House of Commons on Wednesday that 25,000 contact tracers, able to track 10,000 new coronavirus cases a day, would be in place by June 1. However, the much-heralded NHS contact-tracing phone app will not be ready to be rolled out on the same date as planned.

In recent weeks, teaching unions have advised schools not to engage with the UK government about reopening until official guidance is updated to satisfy safety concerns.

Furthermore, a revolt of 68 – mainly Labour-led councils in England – has pushed Downing Street to admit it will not penalize some 1,500 primary schools who are adamant that they will disobey government calls to reopen on June 1, due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

Also on rt.com UK government CAPITULATES to rebellion of Labour-led councils over June school reopening

The report suggests that if the delay lasted until September it would be even less risky, reducing the coronavirus threat to children below the possibility of death through a road traffic accident.

It comes as Public Health England's (PHE) Medical Director Yvonne Doyle told MPs on Friday morning that “ultimately, it will be for schools to decide” whether they are ready to reopen.

The latest data published by the Department for Health and Social Care on Thursday showed that the UK’s Covid-19 death toll has surpassed 36,000.

1149,1149,1416,Live updates: All 50 U.S. states have taken steps toward reopening in time for Memorial Day weekend,"DUBAI — Qatar announced new restrictions on residents, including the mandatory download of a tracking app and the closure of all nonessential stores for the next 10 days, as new infections soar across the region during Ramadan.

Several other Persian Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, have imposed new restrictions recently as cases have increased dramatically following the easing of constraints during the holy month.

Qatar’s announcement followed a cabinet meeting Monday. Starting May 22, all citizens and residents leaving their homes must download the Ehteraz tracking app on their phones so that those coming into contact with someone who tests positive can be tracked. Face masks are also mandatory in Qatar, and violators face jail time and fines of up to $53,000.

Qatar has reported 34,000 cases of the virus (more than 1 percent of the population), with 1,365 new ones just on Monday.

The UAE also announced late Monday that the night curfew would begin at 8 p.m. instead of 10 p.m., “in light of what we have observed during the holy month of Ramadan and the increase in the number of covid-19 infections resulting from some of the individuals in the community who were reckless and didn’t take into account the precautionary measures,” said Saif Juma al-Dhaheri of the Safety and Prevention Department.

Cases in the UAE have topped 24,000, more than twice the number before Ramadan began late last month. Dhaheri warned against family gatherings that could further spread the virus. The fasting period will end this weekend with the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which is normally celebrated with days of family visits and communal dinners.

Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have also experienced major jumps in the new numbers of cases over the weeks of Ramadan, and both have reimposed restrictions.

Starting on Eid al-Fitr, Saudi Arabia, the worst-hit country in the region after Iran, will return to a 24-hour lockdown. The kingdom reported 2,593 new cases Monday, for a total of more than 57,000.

In contrast, prayers at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem will resume following the end of Ramadan festivities, as the virus’s spread there has slowed, the Council of the Islamic Waqf, the religious body that controls the site, said Tuesday.",1
551,551,673,What’s behind China’s new behavior in Europe,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1
1260,1262,1664,New Evidence Suggests the United States Government may have Engineered Covid-19,"The United States has a long history of using bioweapons against its own people.

On September 20, 1950, a US navy ship released a bioweapon into the air just off the coast of San Francisco in a deliberate attempt to experiment with its own population. The experiment resulted in at least one death and countless other infections. No one was prosecuted. In fact, the mainstream media almost completely ignores this piece of history.

Despite popular claims, Project MKUltra is not a conspiracy theory. According to documents uncovered under the Freedom of Information Act, the government illegally experimented on humans to discover means of mind control. Techniques that were used included high doses of psychoactive drugs, electroshocks, sensory deprivation, electroshocks, isolation, sexual abuse, and other forms of torture. These experiments were not just done on prisoners, it was done to innocent American citizens without their consent, including doctors, military personnel, and members of the general public. This information can all be found in wikipedia.

In one well known incident, government researchers, without informing the men they had the diseases, studied the effects of syphilis on African Americans. Afterwards, they deliberately withheld treatment to the men.

In addiction, there are countless other examples of incidents similar to those mentioned above.

After the sars outbreak in 2002, the United States government funded a collaboration of Chinese scientists and the US military from a bioweapons lab in Dort Detrick. Fort Detrick was the center of the U.S. biological weapons program from 1943 to 1969. After the program was discontinued, it served as the host for most elements of the United States biological defense program. It was also the grounds for Project MKUltra.

In 2002, Chinese scientists and a team of American scientists led by none-other than Dr. Fauci, teamed up to study the viruses effect on bat tissues. In addiction, they created what is called pandemic superbots. These were strains that were intentionally created to be more lethal than the strains occurring naturally. The fear of these strains being released alarmed other researchers. One Harvard professor told the Time magazine that Dr. Fauci’s work was intentionally weaponizing the virus. Despite this, Dr. Fauci’s work continued to be subsidized by the US government. Yes, I said the US government, not just the Chinese government.

Over the years, there were various incidents that resulted in the new weaponized virus from nearly being released. In response, in 2014, the US government terminated Fauci’s federal funding. This decision, however, did nothing to stop Fauci’s research. Instead, it just shifted the blame away from the US government over to the Chinese government. The research was then shifted to a military lab in a particular place in China. That place was Wuhan. Once the research was moved to Wuhan, the United States government reinstated its funds to the dangerous research. The amount given is thought to be around $3.7 million, although it is likely that it could be much higher.

Bat rectal swap research was also apart of Dr. Fauci’s research. Remember that the virus was alleged to have came from bats.

Three years later, in 2017, Dr. Fauci did an interview in which he claimed President Trump would face a global pandemic. “The history of the last 32 years that I have been the director of the NIAID will tell the next administration that there is no doubt they will be faced with the challenges their predecessors were faced with… We will definitely get surprised in the next few years.”

Indeed, we were surprised. Three years later, a virus similar to the SARS outbreak came about in the same place Dr. Fauci was creating another coronavirus strain at the same time he claimed a global pandemic would break out. Almost immediately after, the man in charge of these research is appointed to advise President Trump. Is this a coincidence? That’s up for you to decide.

If it is true that this virus was intentionally created and released by the United States, it is also worth noting why. There are many reasons to why the United States and China would intentionally release a bioweapon on its own populations. One theory is that the bankers and investors that control the United States government are using this crisis to dethrone the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, replacing it with an IMF based world currency. This currency would be used to even further their control over our monetary system and increase their wealth even more. We have already seen the United States unofficially endorse a IMF backed world currency. That however, can be discussed another time.

Regardless, these revelations should result in some serious questions being asked, including why the media has completely ignored this information and continues to hail Dr. Fauci as a hero.

1374,1381,1904,Over 2 million infected with Covid-19 in Europe – AFP tally,"Europe has recorded two million cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus, according to a tally by the AFP news agency. The continent was the epicenter of the pandemic until cases skyrocketed in the United States.

Europe passed the two million mark on Saturday, meaning the continent now accounts for nearly two-fifths of the world’s confirmed cases.



New infections and deaths have fallen in the worst-stricken European countries. As summer approaches, lockdown measures have been relaxed, and Spain – the world’s fourth-worst affected country – will reopen for international tourism from July onwards, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced on Saturday. Greece, Portugal and Italy will all welcome visitors again next month, while France will open its borders with neighboring Switzerland and Germany.

Though a relaxation may be coming soon, visitors to these countries will still need to abide by social distancing rules, and in some cases, may have to quarantine themselves upon arrival.

Also on rt.com All aboard! Spain is reopening to international TOURISM from July

While the disease originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, an explosion of cases in Italy, Spain, and France made Europe the coronavirus hotspot of the world from March onwards.

However, the United States then saw a skyrocketing rate of infection, and now accounts for more than 1.6 million cases. Brazil and Russia have also reported drastic rises in infections, with both countries now reporting more than 330,000 cases each.

506,506,623,"Coronavirus, White House Task Force, U.S. Senate: Your Wednesday Briefing","
Want to get The Morning by email? Here’s the sign-up.Good morning. President Trump is disbanding his coronavirus task force. More kids are getting sick. And the meat shortage is getting worse. But let’s start with a virus success story.No lockdown, little virusThe New York Times’s staff members in Hong Kong — like many other workers there — returned to their offices on Monday for the first time in six weeks. They did so after the local government eased some coronavirus restrictions.
To get into the building that houses the Times bureau, reporters and editors had to wear a mask and walk through a thermal scanner that took their temperature. In the elevator, they found a small table with hand sanitizer and tissues, as well as a trash can. Only half of the staff comes into the office at any one time.
This is the new normal in Hong Kong — both very different from before the virus and very different from an American-style lockdown.
Subway workers clean handrails frequently. Restaurants are open, with tables spaced five feet apart. Diners are often given a small paper bag in which to put their mask — so it doesn’t infect the table, or vice versa, as Adrienne Carter, The Times’s Asia editor, told me.
Entrance to Hong Kong is limited mostly to residents, all of whom are tested and quarantined, even if the test is negative. And residents wear masks despite 90-degree heat. “They’re so hot,” Adrienne says. “But it feels second nature to me at this point.”
The most important point: Hong Kong’s strategy is working extremely well.It hasn’t reported a new homegrown case in more than two weeks. Over all, only about 1,000 people — out of 7.5 million — have tested positive. Only four have died.
It’s a sign that a lockdown isn’t the only way to battle the virus. But it’s also a reminder of how different life in a post-reopening United States will be from life in countries that have most effectively stopped the virus’s spread.
Adrienne has lived most of her life in the U.S., and I asked her how well she thought Hong Kong’s strategy could be transferred to today’s United States. “I’m not sure any of it is going to fly,” she said.
Related: “The coronavirus scenario I can’t stop thinking about is the one where we simply get used to all the dying,” Charlie Warzel writes in Opinion.
THE MORNING FIVE1. The end of Trump’s virus task forceThe Trump administration plans to disband its coronavirus task force in the coming weeks. Vice President Mike Pence said the decision was a “reflection of the tremendous progress we’ve made as a country” — despite growing evidence that the outbreak is still raging.
The task force was a key part of President Trump’s response: He often shared the stage with its medical experts, Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci, during televised briefings.
Why it matters: “The influence of those health officials was reassuring to those who believed doctors and scientists should mix with the more economic-minded figures in the group,” said Noah Weiland, who covers health care for The Times. “If the task force dissolves, people like Dr. Fauci may have a less organized role at the White House.”

2. A Covid-linked child illness
The number of children afflicted with a mysterious illness — most likely connected to Covid-19 — is growing. There are now at least 50 reported cases in New York State, and several more across the United States and in Europe.
The symptoms include fever, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea; though none of the children have died, some have needed a mechanical ventilator to help them breathe. The condition suggests that, contrary to early hopes, children will not be spared all of the virus’s most serious effects.

3. A case suggests a new virus timelineThe coronavirus appears to have reached Europe in late December, weeks earlier than previously understood. The new evidence came from a sample taken on Dec. 27 — and tested only recently by doctors — from a 42-year-old man near Paris who had not traveled abroad.
If verified, the discovery would mean the virus was spreading beyond China for weeks, unrecognized.
4. Where’s the beef?The chart below makes clear why the United States has a meat shortage (including at the more than 1,000 Wendy’s franchises that were sold out of burgers this week).
Among the 10 metropolitan areas with the most new confirmed virus cases per capita, half are home to a meat processing plant where workers evidently have the virus. The tight working conditions at the plants seem to be a key reason.

5. A McConnell protégé goes before the Senate
A Senate committee will hold a confirmation hearing today for 37-year-old Justin Walker, the youngest nominee to the federal appellate court in Washington since 1983. Walker is a protégé of Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, who called the Senate back to Washington this week in part for today’s hearing.
Walker’s likely confirmation is part of McConnell’s ambitious strategy for remaking the federal courts. He refused to confirm many nominees in President Barack Obama’s second term and has since helped Trump appoint more than one-quarter of all appellate judges.

BACK STORY: How to clean right Tara Parker-Pope gets some of her best ideas for Well, The Times’s consumer health site, from reader questions. So we’re going to start a regular feature in this newsletter where Tara answers a question that readers submit.
Today’s is about how to clean surfaces effectively — ideally to kill any trace of coronavirus or other germs.
Many cleaning products recommend leaving the disinfectant on a surface for a long time — like four minutes or even 10 minutes — before wiping it off. Several readers asked, in essence: Really?
The short answer: You probably don’t need to take those times literally. They tend to come from laboratory tests involving more germs than exist in most homes. And yet many of us probably are cleaning surfaces too quickly.
“Reporting this story has made me realize how I’ve been cleaning all wrong and too fast,” Tara says. “I always just spray and wipe — I never let it sit!”
Fortunately, the new coronavirus is fairly easy to kill. Even a little extra cleaning time — one expert suggests about a minute — can do the job. For more, read the full story.

659,659,801,"Russian-made ventilators catch fire, kill Covid-positive patients in Moscow and St. Petersburg","Russian-made ventilators catch fire, kill Covid-positive patients

Five people were killed in a fire that sparked in the intensive care unit at St. George’s Hospital in St. Petersburg, which was earlier redesigned to treat patients with coronavirus.

The fire occurred on the sixth floor in the intensive care unit, the fire affected an area of ââten square meters.

All the killed patients were connected to ventilators. Four of them died as a result of carbon monoxide exposure, another one died when the ventilator, to which the patient was connected, was turned off. According to preliminary reports, the fire started due to the hazardous overload of the ventilator.

""The ventilators are operating to the maximum. It is believed that the equipment was overloaded, and the apparatus caught fire,"" officials said.

Reportedly, there were 16 patients in the department at the moment of the accident. Hospital personnel managed to move eleven of them to another wing of the building. In total, as many as 150 people were evacuated from the building; the fire was localized. All the patients and personnel, who were staying in the intensive care unit during the fire, were transferred to the first floor of the hospital.

The Investigative Committee opened a criminal case under Part 3 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ""Causing death by negligence."" Prosecutors currently look into compliance with fire safety requirements at the hospital.

On the evening of May 9, a fire occurred in the building of the Moscow hospital No. 50 named after Spasokukotsky, where patients with coronavirus are also admitted. The fire broke out in the intensive care unit and began to spread along the first floor, having killed one woman patient with COVID-19. Three others were injured.

Within 30 minutes, all 295 patients were evacuated. It is believed that the fire started because of defective ventilators too.

According to law enforcement agencies, the ventilators that caused the fires at hospitals in Moscow and St. Petersburg were manufactured at one factory - the Ural Instrument-Making Plant. The ventilator at the fire-affected hospital in St. Petersburg was installed there on May 3.

According to preliminary reports, the fire at the Moscow hospital occurred as a result of short circuit, which caused oxygen to catch fire. Other versions include short circuit, malfunction, overload and improper operation.",0
70,70,111,"Tours are canceled, so musicians are turning to Twitch","On Tuesday night, musician Marc Rebillet live-streamed on Twitch, looping layers of piano while crooning over the top to create a jazzy, lo-fi track on the fly. Any other day, this would have been a usual performance for Rebillet, who is known for recording his solo sets. But Rebillet wasn’t supposed to be at home on Tuesday night; he was supposed to be performing in Australia. Like many other musicians, his tour was suddenly canceled as a result of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Now, he’s stuck at home, hoping Twitch can mitigate the financial damage from canceled shows. “I’m just trying to survive,” he says, “and Twitch has the highest earning potential for livestreams.”

Rebillet is part of a fast-growing community of musicians who are migrating to digital platforms to perform “quaranstreams” during the pandemic. Many larger artists, like Charli XCX, John Legend, and Diplo are choosing Instagram, but indie artists are overwhelmingly flocking to Twitch.

There’s one likely reason: while Instagram is an easy option to reach lots of people en masse, Twitch offers an abundance of ways to make money. “It’s more financially focused,” says musician and longtime Twitch streamer Ducky. “It supports different tiers of subscriptions and donations. People can subscribe to a channel for free with their Amazon Prime account. Fans can tip in micro amounts with things like Cheers. Other platforms usually just pay out on ad revenue or number of plays.”

In other words, Twitch’s flexible moneymaking features are becoming a stopgap necessity for many indie acts as the novel coronavirus has essentially frozen the music industry in recent weeks. Conferences, festivals, and nightclubs are shut down, and the federal government has recommended public gatherings not exceed 10 people. This has effectively cut off a vital artery of income for artists: shows. “There are a ton of artists that are not going to be okay for the next six months without touring who are trying to get into Twitch streaming right now to make an income to survive,” Ducky says.

Although Rebillet makes money from YouTube, merchandise, PayPal donations, and streaming royalties, he says the bulk of his money comes from hard ticket sales. This is the norm for most American musicians. A study by the Music Industry Research Association found that the average US musician has three sources of income, with the lion’s share overwhelmingly derived from live performances. So when months of shows unexpectedly cancel, it can be financially devastating for indie musicians. “The more you can prove you can sell hard tickets, the more you’re worth when you’re booked,” Rebillet says. “I’m sort of scrambling to find a way to keep being able to live the way I want to live.”

FUCK CORONAVIRUS, LET’S DO THIS pic.twitter.com/4O3qRew6ZU — Marc Rebillet (@marcrebillet) March 15, 2020

Jim Tomaszewski (aka JSTJR) is another artist who has turned to Twitch to supplement his income. Although he’s been building up a YouTube channel over the past year, he recently turned his attention to Twitch as it makes more immediate financial sense. “Over the past year I’ve been living month to month but I haven’t really had to worry,” Tomaszewski says. “I had a full schedule and was booked months in advance. That was kind of new for me. Now, I don’t have any shows for who knows how long. A lot of people perceive that all artists are wealthy, but they don’t really understand. It’s looking pretty grim.”

With no sense of when live shows will resume, artists like Rebillet, Tomaszewski, Ducky, and others have created weekly Twitch live stream schedules. On Mondays, Ducky produces tracks. Tomaszewski DJs on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Indie artist Mija, who was mid-tour when all of her remaining shows were canceled, is now painting on Tuesdays and performing acoustic sets on Wednesdays. Electronic artist Sam Vogel (aka Jauz) hosts “demo roulette” on Mondays where he works on Ableton projects submitted by fans. Vogel was planning to live-stream his “Bite This” radio show on Fridays from a studio, but he doesn’t know “if [traveling there] is viable anymore because everything is changing literally every day.”

In the rush to get set up on Twitch, some musicians are learning about the platform’s rules the hard way. Rebillet received a 24-hour ban during his first live stream for taking his shirt off and “singing about sex.” (His account has since been reinstated.) On the other side, fans appear eager to see artists join Twitch and excitedly fill up chats. “Are you going to start streaming more now?” someone asks on Mija’s first Twitch stream. “Maybe,” she says in response. “Now that my tour is canceled, don’t really have much else to do but make shit. I’ll make music on here, I just have to figure out how to set everything up.”

For now, the musicians say Twitch is only recouping a fraction of lost funds, but they believe it will become more sustainable. And many say they intend to maintain their Twitch presence when things go back to normal. “Could I live off of what I’m making on Twitch right now? Absolutely not,” Vogel says. “But I think live-streaming will be a crucial part of being a musician or an entertainer. It’s something that will inevitably happen in the future.”

Established Twitch musicians like Ducky are watching the influx with cautious optimism. Big artists can bring swaths of new music fans to the platform, but they can also disrupt the communities that many like her, Grimecraft, matphilly, and others have worked to grow on Twitch. In a recent tweet, Ducky expressed concern over the wave of large artists making the jump. “Twitch has etiquette,” Ducky says. “There’s a culture on Twitch that’s worth familiarizing yourself with, especially if you’re going to come into the platform with a built-in audience.”

what if big artists who have built in platforms and (presumably) more saved revenue from higher fees etc who are going to switch to streaming anyways and immediately generate more income than smaller artists attempting to do the same used those platforms to build community growth — DUCKY (@QUACKHOUSE) March 16, 2020

For those new to the platform, Ducky says there are two things Twitch musicians can do to support each other. The first is raids, which is when streamers send their viewers to another person’s live channel at the end of their stream. The second is setting up auto-hosting lists, which lets a channel broadcast another user’s stream when they’re not live. “If you think about an artist that goes on tour... What do they do?” says Ducky. “They book support acts. That’s how I look at raiding and auto hosting. It’s an opportunity to build up other musicians.”

From a fan’s point of view, it’s exciting to connect with their favorite artists in new and intimate ways amid the chaos of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. And while many musicians are now delving into Twitch to try to find an economic way forward in uncertain times, it also fulfills another need: creating a social and emotional connection to the outside world. “I’ve always felt like I’m one with my fan base instead of someone they should be admiring,” says Tomaszewski. “We’re all in it together.”",1
15,15,32,Megachurch In South Korea Accused Of Spreading Coronavirus,"Megachurch In South Korea Accused Of Spreading Coronavirus

The church accounts for more than half of the nearly 4,000 coronavirus cases in the region. Critics accuse the church of being a cult and obstructing efforts to fight the outbreak.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

A megachurch in South Korea is at the center of the coronavirus outbreak in that country. There are more than 4,000 cases in South Korea, and more than half of those are members of the church. The church's critics accuse its leaders of obstructing official efforts to fight this outbreak. As NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Seoul, the group's founder is now apologizing.

ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: At a training facility of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus outside Seoul, the group's founder, 84-year-old Lee Man-hee, addressed a crowd of journalists on Monday afternoon.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LEE MAN-HEE: (Speaking Korean).

KUHN: ""People of South Korea, how can I apologize to you?"" He said in a quavering voice. ""I feel utterly ashamed. I bow down before you to ask your forgiveness."" He knelt his forehead, nearly touching the ground. Protesters shouted at him in the background.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LEE M: (Speaking Korean).

KUHN: ""This is not about any individual. This is a huge disaster,"" he added. ""We're doing everything we can to stop it. Now is not the time to judge who's wrong and who's right."" The Seoul city government filed criminal charges against Lee on Sunday, saying his failure to turn over complete lists of church members amounts to homicide. He insists he's fully cooperating with authorities. The group admits that some of its members travelled from China to South Korea at the end of last year, possibly bringing the virus with them. Health authorities are testing around 200,000 of the church's members for infections, including Lee Man-hee himself.

Lee Jung-eun, a Ph.D. candidate at Seoul National University's religious studies department, says that before the epidemic, the church was growing robustly.

LEE JUNG-EUN: (Through interpreter) Shincheonji is the most prominent of the homegrown new religious movements. It's also the youngest and the most energetic. It's said that a third of its followers are from younger generations.

KUHN: In recent years, the church has filled vast arenas with his followers, such as this 2018 event in Seoul. Musicians wore tuxedos and traditional hanbok gowns. After the music, Lee Man-hee delivered a sermon punctuated by roars of approval from the crowd. Critics say the packed rows of believers and hearty amens are perfect for spreading viruses. Since the outbreak within its membership became known, the church has shut down all of its 1,100 churches and facilities nationwide. At a sermon in Daegu city last year, Lee foretold the coming of a new heaven and earth, or Shincheonji in Korean.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LEE M: (Speaking Korean).

KUHN: ""Six thousand years of God's history ends here in this world, in this time,"" he says. ""Even the archenemy, Satan, will be captured and jailed. That's what the book of Revelation says. Then comes the Kingdom of God, the one that lives forever."" Religious scholar Lee Jung-eun says this is how Shincheonji attracts followers - by promising them eternal life, not after they die but in their current bodies.

LEE J: (Through interpreter) Lee Man-hee is supposed to be immortal. Shincheonji believers think that he will not die, nor will they, if they make it into a group of 144,000 believers whom he has promised eternal life.

KUHN: She says Shincheonji and other groups like it have thrived under South Korea's laissez-faire religious policies.

LEE J: (Through interpreter) Religions are seen to have their own space and their own logic separate from the rest of society. This view has contributed to the emergence and growth of various sects and a sort of neoliberal free market of religion.

KUHN: But the government is under pressure to act against the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. More than a million people have signed a petition on the presidential office's website calling for the government to disband the group.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chief Petty Officer Gary Keen/U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer Gary Keen/U.S. Navy

The U.S. Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort is scheduled to depart New York City on Thursday after deploying there to help with the coronavirus pandemic.

U.S. Northern Command announced on Tuesday that the Comfort, which arrived in Manhattan on March 30, would return to its berth in Norfolk, Va.

Other military personnel, ships, aircraft and facilities will remain involved in the disaster response, and the Comfort itself will continue to stand by.

""Even as USNS Comfort departs NYC, the ship and its embarked medical task force remain prepared for future tasking,"" the statement said. ""The Navy, along with other U.S. Northern Command dedicated forces, remains engaged throughout the nation in support of the broader COVID-19 response.""

There was no immediate information about a prospective second deployment for the Comfort or whether the ship might sail to another destination within the United States or somewhere abroad. The Comfort often undertakes medical missions to the Caribbean, Central American and elsewhere.

The ship's roughly 1,000 patient beds were first to be used as spillover capacity for non-coronavirus sufferers in greater New York, with the idea that they would free up space on land for pandemic victims.

Later, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and public health officials asked that the ship, which had not seen many cases, begin taking suspected pandemic patients, the first of which came aboard on April 6. There was no immediately available accounting about how many total patients the Comfort accommodated during its deployment to New York.

The Comfort's sibling, the West Coast-based hospital ship USNS Mercy, deployed to Los Angeles to help with the pandemic there. The crew of the Mercy also had to try to manage a COVID-19 outbreak among its own personnel.",1

This is the first installment of Reopenings, a series about how businesses are operating during the pandemic.

In a few parts of the country, it is possible once again to pay someone to fix your split ends and shaggy sideburns. As part of the limited reopenings of their economies, Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wyoming are or will soon be allowing hair salons and barber shops to operate as long as they follow certain social distancing measures. Already these businesses are finding that their services have been missed. Brooke McLaughlin, who co-owns the Taylor Brooks Hair Salon & Spa in Johns Creek, Georgia, said that her stylists have had to fix a lot of unmaintained hair and botched DIY jobs during their first week back in business. “It was horrendous. A lot of our men tried to cut the sides of their hair, and they couldn’t blend the tops to the sides. Bless them; they were trying really hard, so A for effort,” she said. “A lot of roots were really overgrown as far as coloring goes for my female clients.”

What is it like to get a haircut during a pandemic? For one obvious thing, it’s impossible for a business that involves hand-to-hair contact to stick to the six-feet-of-distance guidelines that are a mainstay of coronavirus lockdowns across the country. “You’re maximizing your ability to be safe in an environment that arguably can’t be made totally safe,” said Leslie Roste, the director of education for the salon disinfectant company Barbicide, who has been working with states to develop reopening guidelines for salons. “Everybody is within six feet of each other, touching strangers all day long. If you’re cutting my hair, you’re standing behind me, breathing on me.”

In lieu of having stylists stand six feet away from clients, many businesses have instead limited the number of customers they let in at a time, requiring appointments, avoiding double bookings, putting safety markings on the floor at six-foot intervals so that some distancing can take place, and seating clients farther apart from one another as they have their haircuts. The Three-13 Salon, Spa & Boutique in Marietta, Georgia, has also been careful about whom they’ve let in to their building since reopening last week. According to managing partner Lester Crowell, the salon has been asking customers a list of diagnostic questions—like whether they were living with anyone sick during quarantine—and having them submit to a temperature check before they can enter. Employees are also required to wear pink stickers around the workplace to indicate that they’ve undergone their daily temperature check and aren’t running a fever.

The cosmetology industry already has fairly strict sanitation rules. Between each appointment, stylists have to immerse their haircut tools in a disinfectant solution for a certain amount of time, launder towels and linens, and wash their hands, among other steps. Some establishments are now instituting additional cleaning measures. Stylists at Taylor Brooks have been bleaching the shampoo bowls and applying Lysol spray to all the chairs the moment a client is finished. Three-13 has been making appointment windows longer so that stylists have more time to clean up between customers and is starting to drape disposable capes on its clients instead of reusing them. The salon also has cleaners in hazmat suits come in every week to cover everything in a chlorinated disinfectant spray.

Three-13 and Taylor Brooks are instructing employees to wear masks while working. They’ve also been asking that all customers have masks while patronizing their establishments, though this can be an obstacle for beauticians. “My first day back, a client had a mask that went around the back of the head,” McLaughlin said. “Something that I was very used to doing from muscle memory for 20 years I had to rethink.” To ensure scalp access, she shifted the strap above and below the hairline as she snipped away, all while trying to ensure that the mask stayed in place. Masks that hang around people’s ears are easier because the customer can remove one strap at a time so that the stylist can cut their sideburns.

Masks are also particularly inconvenient for facials and waxing, since those services generally require unobstructed access to the face. Three-13 has its customers maneuver their masks around their face so stylists can wax stray lip hairs. Facials are even tougher. “For a facial, you’ve pretty much got to take it off,” said Crowell. “You can hold it to your nose and mouth a little, and we do that, but it’s difficult.” Taylor Brooks is opting not to do lip waxing at the moment. The salon is also making only one aesthetician available for facials, for which customers may remove their masks. The aesthetician, who wears a face mask and shield herself, performs the facials for one person at a time in a room that’s closed off from the rest of the building.

Salons are also altering or even doing away with waiting rooms and the associated amenities to further limit the risk of infection. Three-13 reduced its indoor waiting room to two ottomans and is having most customers sit on spaced-out folding chairs on an outdoor veranda. The restrictions in general also mean fewer clients can come. Before the outbreak, the salon would normally see 250 people on a Friday and 350 on a Saturday. This last week it saw 100 on Friday and 120 on Saturday.

At Taylor Brooks, which has been “booked solid,” employees threw away all the magazines, removed the coffee bar, and packed up all the furniture where customers used to be able to lounge before their appointments. Now they just wait in their cars. The business is also asking customers not to touch any retail hair products they wish to purchase.

Taken together, these safety procedures will clearly make the experience of getting a haircut far more impersonal. Roste predicts that for a while it will be harder to follow the time-honored traditions of gabbing with locals at the barbershop or decompressing with your favorite stylist. “This has always been considered sort of a luxury service. It’s supposed to be a downtime where you have a service that makes you feel better when you walk out,” she said, adding that the rigid guidelines may make the atmosphere a bit more clinical and businesslike. “A lot of that social aspect may have to go away. That makes me sad, but I think in the short term that people will have to be much more cautious.”",1
1145,1145,1408,Hundreds of McDonald's workers plan Wednesday strike over COVID-19 protections,"Hundreds of McDonald’s workers in 20 cities plan to strike Wednesday on the day before the company’s annual shareholders meeting — part of an effort to pressure the fast-food chain into improving what they say are inadequate protections for employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Labor organizers say there have been scores of McDonald's workers with COVID-19 in at least 17 states. They also cite a survey of more than 800 McDonald's workers from March 31 to April 6 in which 42% reported being told not to wear masks and gloves by management. The survey also said 46% came to work feeling sick because they were afraid they would be disciplined or penalized.

The strike is supported by the Service Employees International Union and is being organized by the ""Fight for $15"" minimum-wage labor campaign.

""This is about choices,"" SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said. ""McDonald’s can do the right thing and protect its workers. It is choosing not to.""

The company disputes the allegations by these workers, saying they are not representative of the 850,000 McDonald’s employees nationwide. McDonald’s also called it a strategically timed “publicity stunt” by labor organizers.

Each side planned to take out full-page advertisements in national newspapers this week on the subject of safety at McDonald's restaurants. One ad is scheduled to appear Wednesday in USA TODAY in the form of an open letter to McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski. It was submitted by several public health professionals, including David Michaels, former chief of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

“Reports by McDonald’s crew members and media outlets reveal a pattern of severe shortcomings by McDonald’s under your leadership to fully comply with the highest standards for safety and hygiene at a time when such failures can have deadly consequences for workers, their families, their communities, and your customers,” the letter states.

“We are aware of scores of cases of COVID-19 positive workers in at least 16 states across the country. Time and time again, McDonald’s has failed to swiftly close and disinfect stores following confirmed reports of COVID-19 among employees. To make matters worse, your restaurants have also failed to promptly inform workers of exposure to the virus and to provide pay during quarantine,” the letter continues.

McDonald’s sent its own message Tuesday with an ad in The New York Times. It is planning to open dining rooms at restaurants where permitted and says its 14,000 locally owned restaurants are “putting safety first.” The ad also says that it has more than 50 new procedures that go “well beyond masks and gloves” to keep everyone safe.

McDonald’s vice president for U.S. communications, David Tovar, said restaurants now have an ample amount of cleaning supplies, gloves and masks, and he suggested the employee survey from April was outdated at best. He also said labor actions at McDonald’s so far only have involved a small fraction of the workforce.

Henry of the SEIU said these are widespread issues.

""I don’t think there would be strikes happening on 20 cities all on the same day (Wednesday) if this was not a widely experienced condition of all workers in fast-food restaurants,"" she said.

A group of strikers also plans to hold a Zoom meeting with Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday to discuss their ongoing efforts to hold McDonald’s accountable during the pandemic.

Since March, employees in some cities have conducted walkouts to protest McDonald’s response to COVID-19. Wednesday’s action is billed by organizers as the first coordinated nationwide strike.

“The way work is set up right now at McDonald’s, the workers are at increased risk for transmission of COVID-19, and there are reported cases of COVID-19 among workers, which is not surprising considering the conditions that have been reported to me,” said Michaels, an epidemiologist.

Michaels said he was approached by some of the workers and has agreed to advise them as an unpaid expert.

“Are their demands reasonable?” Michaels asked. “I think they are.”

The strikers want McDonald’s to halt dividends and instead use that money for increased safety and economic protections for workers, including “pandemic pay of $15X2,” plus paid sick leave and sufficient protective gear for workers. They also want immediate store closures when workers become infected to allow for a deep cleaning, contact tracing and self-quarantine for two weeks at full pay.

The workers cite a number of examples in various cities about the lack of protective gear or inadequate response to sickness among workers. In San Francisco, workers filed a complaint alleging managers told them not to worry about a lack of masks in the store, suggesting they use coffee filters instead.

Tovar of McDonald's said the company has strict social distancing guidelines and takes safety seriously for customers and employees. He said there have been less than 10 restaurants out of the 14,000 in the country ""that have had any type of activity like this that’s been orchestrated by the SEIU.""

""That’s not to say there aren’t real issues and concerns that are out there, as we’re all dealing with this terrible pandemic,"" he said. ""But the feedback that we get from thousands of employees does not match (what the SEIU says).""

The worker experience can vary by location. In Los Angeles, longtime McDonald’s cook Bartolome Perez makes $14.25 an hour and says he’s seen his hours reduced after speaking up previously about the working conditions. He plans to strike Wednesday.

“They only care for their profits,” he said. “They don’t care for our lives. They show it to us again and again.”

858,858,1029,Jack Dorsey just unveiled where he's donated more than $87 million of his pledged $1 billion towards COVID-19 relief,"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has donated over $87 million towards his COVID-19 relief pledge.

His donations have ranged across a number of causes from stopping domestic violence, to giving equal access to the internet for students.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced last month that he was donating $1 billion of his Square equity to COVID-19 relief, and so far he's dispersed over $87 million.

Dorsey created a new charity fund called Start Small LLC, which will initially focus on relief efforts to help with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Dorsey estimated that the fund is around 28% of his total wealth.

The Twitter CEO released a spreadsheet, which so far only shows $73 million in donations, accounting for how much and to where donations are being made. According to the spreadsheet, Dorsey has made contributions to organizations tackling domestic violence due to the pandemic, HIV/AIDS, refugees, advocacy for prisoners, among many others.

However, in a tweet, Dorsey added that there are several initiatives that have not been added to the spreadsheet yet.

Dorsey has so far donated over $1.3 million to two organizations that will screen for HIV as well as address how the current pandemic is impacting HIV in marginalized communities.

""Funds will support the Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF) COVID-19 Emergency Fund to support EJAF frontline partners to respond to the pandemic and its' effects on HIV prevention and care for the most marginalized communities,"" Dorsey's spreadsheet wrote.

Experts have worried efforts to limit the spread of and treat infectious diseases like HIV could be significantly reduced due to the pandemic.

Tolbert Nyenswah, a research associate at Johns Hopkins University, previously told Business Insider that in countries where patients rely on clinics for medication, a lack of personal protective equipment means entire facilities that many rely on could be shut down if one hospital worker gets sicks.

That leaves people dealing with infectious diseases at risk. ""This will have longtime consequences for decades to come,"" Nyenswah said

Domestic violence has also increased as more people were sheltering in place. Business Insider previously reported that calls to hotlines in major cities increased during the lockdown. Dorsey is funding multiple initiatives to address the concern totaling more than $2.2 million.

He's also invested in organizations that provide necessary food for people in need, providing support for the homeless, mental health initiatives, as well as $10 million into the Oakland School Fund to close the educational gap between students who don't access to the internet and those who do.

According to The San Francisco Chronicle, officials in Oakland launched the initiative on Thursday to raise $12.5 million for 25,000 laptops and internet hotspots to families in the city. In a tweet Dorsey' wrote that he saw the initiative and funded it ""immediately.""

""$10mm to give EVERY single child in Oakland access to a laptop and internet in their homes, closing the digital divide,"" he wrote on Twitter.

The Chronicle added that 50,000 students in the cities public school system ""are disconnected or under-connected from technology at home.""

The $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package marks the largest rescue package in American history. President Trump announced Wednesday that it includes $300 billion in direct payments to individuals to alleviate at least a little of the financial pain caused by the deliberate near-standstill of the U.S. economy.

But despite promises that the one-time funds will be distributed ""within the next three weeks,"" it will likely be months before the stimulus checks hit bank accounts according to experts.

Under the plan, single people earning incomes below $75,000 will receive as much as $1,200 as ""direct payments into most people's deposit accounts,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a news briefing on Wednesday.

Married couples would get $2,400, and parents would receive $500 for each child under age 17. About 90% of households — approximately 165 million — would benefit from the checks, according to the Tax Policy Center.

Payments would be phased out beyond those income limits, and people making more than $99,000 will not be eligible at all.

How soon can I expect my check?

""It really depends on what information the IRS has on you,"" Kyle Pomerleau, a resident fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told NPR.

That's because the infusion of cash will be distributed by the IRS, so those who have previously received tax refunds via direct deposit will be first in line for the rebate checks. Pomerleau, estimates the earliest those payments will go out is three to four weeks after the package is approved.

Alternatively, people who receive tax refunds through the mail will have to hold out much longer.

""I don't think physical checks will be in the mail for another three to four months,"" Pomerleau said, citing delays in the system in 2008 when the government last issued national stimulus payments under the George W. Bush administration.

Back then the financial relief package was signed into law in February but the delivery date for people whose checks were sent through the mail was somewhere between May and July.

There's another group who may have an even longer wait: Those who receive tax refunds in the mail and have moved since filing 2018 taxes.

""So far there's no information on how [the IRS is] going to handle that,"" he said.

What if I didn't file 2018 taxes?

Pomerleau says nonfilers, including recent college graduates, and those who didn't file 2018 taxes because they had no obligation, ""would be left out unless they hurry up and file a return for 2019.""

Americans receiving Social Security benefits are also on file with the government and their payments will be based on those records, he added.

What if I made more than $99,000 in 2018 or 2019?

Those who earned more than $99,000 are not totally shut out from the massive relief package if they expect to make less than that sum in the coming year.

The IRS will allow tax filers to qualify for the relief aid next year, when filing 2020 taxes.

""That of course is no good for someone who needs to pay their bills today,"" Pomerleau said, ""but all is not lost.""

Other holdups

Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, suspects the IRS's infrastructure, or lack thereof, will create even more delays for desperate people.

In the past it has taken several months for the government to develop, test and install the kind of software necessary to launch a rebate program. But it is unclear, what if anything, the administration has done behind the scenes so far.

""It takes several months to get a program like this up and moving,"" Holtzblatt told NPR.

""I hope that they've been building their infrastructure in the days between when they first announced they were going to do this and the day of enactment,"" she said, adding that in 2008, the process took at least three months.

Impact of COVID-19 on the IRS

Another unknown factor, that Holtzblatt says needs to be considered is how the COVID-19 disease is going to affect the capacity of the IRS staff to ensure the timely delivery of the payments.

As she noted in a recent blog post:

All of that may slow distribution of the payments, Holtzblatt said.

She cautioned the public to be patient: ""The IRS will be overburdened and there will be lots of taxpayer confusion ... and all this will collide with the processing of 2019 returns. There will be snafus.""",1
1325,1328,1802,"Trump declares houses of worship ‘essential,’ pressuring governors to let them reopen","Trump emphasized he was instructing governors to allow places of worship to resume operations “right now,” and warned that “if there’s any question, they’re going to have to call me — but they are not going to be successful in that call.”

It is unclear whether the president is legally empowered to compel the nation’s governors to take such an action. If the White House moves to enforce his order in defiance of opposition by local officials, Trump could force a constitutional clash over one of the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the First Amendment.

Challenged on Trump’s authority to unilaterally reopen places of worship, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said at the briefing Friday the administration would “leave it to faith communities to reopen,” and pointed to “detailed guidance” from the federal government “about the way you can clean your facility [and] promote social distancing.”

But soon after his remarks at the White House, the president was confronted with resistance from state and local executives. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said she would not alter her state’s plans to reopen places of worship on May 30, and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also announced her city would ignore Trump’s demand.

“By no means can the president order any locality, any state to do something that he doesn’t have the power to do,” Lightfoot said. “And he can’t do that here.”

The CDC’s guidelines, released after weeks of internal debate and scrutiny over leaked drafts, offered detailed measures for how places of worship can start to safely reopen, while advising them to consult with state and local authorities. In contrast with the earlier leaked guidelines, the agency didn’t recommend a phased reopening and instead laid out recommendations for how faith-based communities can promote safety, hygiene and social distancing.

For instance, the agency suggested groups consider suspending or decreasing how often choirs are used, as well as congregant singing and chanting during a service “if appropriate within the faith tradition.” It also recommended temporary limits on sharing religious objects, like books or cups, and to instead photocopy or email prayers to attendees.

Public health experts have expressed concern about the risks related to reopening places of worship. At least two churches in Georgia and Texas that had recently reopened shut down again this week after members tested positive for the virus, and a report from the CDC earlier this week documented how an early March outbreak in a rural Arkansas church spread from a pastor and his wife to about three dozen parishioners, killing three.

Still, Trump insisted Friday that Americans are nevertheless “demanding to go to church and synagogue or to their mosque,” and he predicted “the ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe” when they gather.

“They don’t want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else,” Trump said. “The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now, for this weekend. If they don’t do it, I will override the governors. In America, we need more prayer, not less.”

Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, stressed the importance of practicing mitigation measures as places of worship reopen, and said community faith leaders should be in touch with their local health departments.

“I think what we are trying to say with the CDC guidance is there is a way for us to work together to have social distancing and safety for people, so that we decrease the amount of exposure that anyone would have to asymptomatic [people],” she said. “And I see it that way because I know all of you and all of Americans, if they didn’t feel well, they wouldn’t go to church that day.”",1
1303,1306,1754,The coronavirus invades Trump country,"Republicans are still less worried about the coronavirus than Democrats or independents, even as it spreads out from primarily urban areas into suburban and rural Republican-leaning areas.

Why it matters: The virus doesn't care about politics or geography. High-risk behavior in places where the virus is spreading is the recipe for an outbreak.

Map courtesy of the Brookings Institute. Note: High-risk counties are counties with at least 100 cases per 100,000 residents, as of May 17.

The big picture: For the last four weeks, counties newly designated as having a high prevalence of coronavirus cases — meaning at least 100 cases per 100,000 people — were more likely to have voted for President Trump than Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to a recent analysis by the Brookings Institution.

The most recently identified counties tend to be in the South and the Midwest.

Between March 29 and May 17, the portion of Americans living in high-prevalence counties rose from 8% to 79%.

What they're saying: ""This suggests that rhetoric from some of the president’s supporters against maintaining public health measures may become more muted, as the nation continues to grapple with the many unknowns about COVID-19’s continued spread,"" writes William Frey, the author of the analysis.

Yes, but: That's not happening.

Republicans are more willing than Democrats or independents to partake in activities that involve interacting with other people, per new polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Two-thirds of Republicans said either that the pandemic isn't a major problem or that the ""worst is behind us."" On the other hand, 70% of Democrats and half of independents said that the ""the worst is yet to come.""

4,4,5,China reports 25 coronavirus deaths; US prepares evacuation,"BEIJING — China on Tuesday reported 25 more deaths from a new viral disease, raising the total to at least 106, as the U.S. government prepared to fly Americans out of the city at the center of the outbreak.

Health authorities in Hubei province, where the coronavirus first was detected in in December, reported 24 deaths and those in Beijing reported the Chinese capital’s first fatality. No national toll was announced, but 81 other deaths had been reported through Monday.

The U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, where authorities cut off most access Jan. 22 in an effort to contain the disease, was preparing to fly its diplomats and some other Americans out of the city. Japan, France and Mongolia and other governments also were preparing evacuations.

China had expanded its already sweeping disease-control efforts by extending the end of this week’s Lunar New Year holiday, the country’s busiest travel season, by three days to Sunday to keep the public at home and reduce the risk infection will spread.

Mongolia closed its vast border with China. Hong Kong and Malaysia announced they were barring entry to visitors from Hubei province. Chinese travel agencies were ordered to cancel group tours nationwide.

U.S. health officials expanded their recommendation for people to avoid non-essential travel to any part of China, rather than just Wuhan and other areas most affected by the outbreak.

On Tuesday, English-proficiency and other tests for students to apply to foreign universities were canceled. Public schools and universities have been ordered to postpone reopening following the Lunar New Year holiday until further notice.

Stock markets around the world were down sharply Monday as investors worried the outbreak could hurt the global economy.

China has confirmed more than 2,700 cases of the new virus, most in Wuhan. More than 40 cases have been confirmed elsewhere in the world. Almost involve Chinese tourists or people who visited Wuhan.

China’s increasingly drastic containment efforts began with the Jan. 22 suspension of plane, train and bus links to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. That lockdown has expanded to 17 cities with more than 50 million people — the most far-reaching disease-control measures ever imposed.

The epidemic has revived memories of the SARS outbreak that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people. Then, Chinese authorities were criticized for reacting slowly and failing to disclose information. The government has responded more aggressively to the latest outbreak.

Wuhan is building two hospitals, one with 1,500 beds and another with 1,000, for the growing number of patients. The first is scheduled to be finished next week.

The virus is from the coronavirus family that includes the common cold but also more severe illnesses like SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The new virus causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.

The virus is thought to have spread to people from wild animals sold at a market in Wuhan. On Sunday, authorities banned trade in wild animals and urged people to stop eating meat from them.",1
998,998,1193,"With quarantine baking on the rise, flour mills barely have enough bags to package flour with","Flour producers are seeing an increase in demand as Americans turn to baking in quarantine.

One mill in upstate New York is operating 18 hours a day to keep up, but barely has enough bags to package flour with.

The supply chain hasn't quite kept up with the shift in demand, which might be why flour is still missing from grocery store shelves.

View more episodes of Business Insider Today on Facebook.

These days it seems like everyone has picked up baking as a quarantine hobby.

That is, if you can find the necessary ingredients. Consumers across the country have reported a lack of yeast and flour at supermarkets since the pandemic started.

But flour producers are telling another story: that they aren't in danger of running out.

""There's not a flour shortage,"" flour miller Thor Oechsner told Business Insider Today. ""The mills are running. We can't get it packaged quick enough to get it out, the way that demand has flipped.""

Oechsner is the co-owner of Farmer Ground Flour, a small company from Trumansburg, New York, that sells mostly wholesale to bakeries and food co-ops. Now, it has lost many of those orders, but demand from individual consumers and supermarkets is higher than ever.

And that means changing how the flour is packaged — which is the real challenge for him.

""Our mill is set up to pretty efficiently build 25- and 50-pound bags going wholesale to bakeries. We are not super well set up to do 2-pound bags. I mean we can do them, but not at this quantity,"" he said.

Since the flour is packaged manually, it is more time-consuming to fill smaller bags.

""For the first three weeks of the whole COVID-19 thing, we got more orders for 2-pound cases than we get normally in almost a year. So it's just this exponential explosion, these 2-pound bags,"" Oechsner said.

The packaging challenges may explain why some consumers are seeing flour sold in unmarked bags or large quantities.

Meanwhile, the shift in demand means flour mills are working overtime. The mill that Oechsner co-owns is operating 18 hours a day. It's also impacting the supply chain, making it hard for flour producers to get the supplies they need.

But Oechsner says he still doesn't know if the increase in demand is enough to make up for the wholesale orders he's lost.

""I think at this point everybody at the mill is so hunkered down trying to fill these orders that nobody exactly knows how this is shaking out financially, just because it's seriously all hands on deck to try to get, you know, even come close to filling these orders,"" he said.",1
1251,1252,1646,"APPEALS to the President: Mikovits, Adams and Kalcker lay out powerful executive strategies President Trump can use to abolish Big Pharma’s death grip on America","(Natural News) During a recent interview on IAMTV, with Alan Keyes and Bob Sissen, three health freedom advocates offered a list of executive actions that President Trump could take to end Big Pharma’s death grip on the USA and save countless lives from the pharma “death industry.”

Dr. Judy Mikovits, Andreas Kalcker and myself, Mike Adams, offered a comprehensive list that could radically improved humanity’s survival, health and prosperity. Here’s a partial transcript from the video:

Judy Mikovits: The first thing to do is to end the 1986 Vaccine Injury Compensation act, which removes all liability. The second thing is a five-year moratorium on all vaccines until theyâre tested safe and thatâll take a lot longer than five years. In those five years,everyoneâs going to realize they have natural immunity and youâre going to see these diseases go away. Close the FDA. Close the CDC. Close the EPA. All of these corrupt organizations, reorganize them. Open them to give back the taxpayers their money to be able to use the medicines naturally.Weâll put Dr. David Lewis in charge of the EPA. He wrote the book Science for Sale uncovering the corruption in that industry. We can have Dr. Stephanie sent up there over the FDA. No more GMO, no more Roundup so he can do all these things and reject and end the BayhâDole Act… which government employees who are paid with taxpayer money for Health and Human Services to patent their work. No more patents. All the drugs belong to the people. All our brains belong to the people because you paid for our education, everything. That will turn around all of medicine to give it back all doctors equal. No more health insurance. $5000 tax-free account you can spend on anything you want. Your supplement, your cannabis, your chlorine dioxide. You can take care of your health just the way we used to when I was a little kid.

Mike Adams: In addition to that outstanding list, I would ask President Trump issue an Executive order expanding the First Amendment to cover truthful speech about nutritional supplements and natural interventions, alternative medicine, healing remedies. If itâs truthful, then it should not be criminal, obviously. If we just shut down the FDA and the FTC and the CDC that would solve the problem as well. Secondly, and this is something President Trump can issue right now, he can issue an Executive Order ordering the FDA to ban direct-to-consumer drug advertisements. They are illegal in almost every country in the world. If he were to do that, he would immediately halt the disease-mongering and the profiteering of the drug companies. He would cut off about 70 percent of the revenues to the fake news industries such as CNN that depends on pharma profits, which is why they are puppets of Big Pharma. He could do that with an Executive Order. Finally, I agree with Dr. Mikovits that patents, there should never be intellectual property claims over drugs. Drugs can be developed by universities. Most of the drug development that happens in the United States is actually funded by the NIH anyway, and drug companies simply exploit that free money so they can make billions off of patented drugs, which are really FDA-enforced drug monopolies. That needs to end.

Andreas Kalcker: I would put to that that when you have the patents, you cannot patent any living entity at all. Life is life and this is not patentable, and this is one of the things that has been put in the last time that has to be out of that. Because if you cannot patent a virus, thereâs no business anymore. The next thing is that you can make the pharmaceutical compound. We donât need the FDA-approved thing if chlorine dioxide is just approved as a pharmaceutical compound. Itâs a very simple substance that can be used and prescribed by every doctor and be made in any simple pharmacy. That would be my dream and the dream of the world. We could end [the pandemic] in a very few months before even the elections. We could end all these drama of coronavirus.

Judy Mikovits: And restore our economy. These gross natural products. This HHS. This whole corrupt monster. Just knock it down. And give us back our freedom.

385,385,477,Ford and Lincoln cancel Rivian-powered electric vehicle due to the pandemic,"Ford and its luxury brand Lincoln have canceled an all-electric SUV that was going to be powered by technology provided by EV startup Rivian, the companies told Automotive News on Tuesday.

Lincoln says it is still working closely with Rivian, including an “alternative vehicle” that will also be based on Rivian’s electric vehicle skateboard platform.

“Given the current environment, Lincoln and Rivian have decided not to pursue the development of a fully electric vehicle based on Rivian’s skateboard platform. Our strategic commitment to Lincoln, Rivian and electrification remains unchanged and Lincoln’s future plans will include an all-electric vehicle,” a spokesperson from Lincoln told The Verge in a statement.

Ford has put more than $500 million into Rivian

Lincoln declined to say what specifically about the pandemic led to the cancellation. “This was a decision that was mutually made by Lincoln and Rivian given the rapidly changing environment and after a review of product plans,” the spokesperson said. “As we moved through the development cycle, we determined that it would be better to pivot from the Rivian’s skateboard platform and focus our development efforts on Lincoln’s own fully-electric vehicle.”

Amy Mast, Rivian’s public relations director, said “Ford and Lincoln continue to be great partners.” Rivian recently announced that it’s pushing back the release of its first two vehicles — an all-electric pickup truck and SUV — to early 2021 because of the pandemic.

Ford announced a $500 million investment in Rivian last year, just two months after Amazon led a $700 million investment in the Michigan-based startup. As part of Ford’s investment, it announced that it would develop an electric vehicle that used Rivian’s battery pack and electric motor setup. It was reported at the time that the vehicle would be part of the Lincoln stable, something the luxury brand confirmed this past January. Ford also participated in a $1.3 billion fundraising round for Rivian that closed in December.

Founded in 2009, Rivian originally set out to build an all-electric sports car much like Tesla’s Roadster. But it eventually pivoted to an electric pickup truck and SUV. The company operated in stealth mode for nearly a decade until it unveiled those two vehicles at the 2018 LA Auto Show. It has since hired over 2,000 people and has opened offices all over North America.",1
269,269,346,Letting the pandemic change us for the better,"When I was 24 years old, I fell off a cliff and shattered my face. Surviving a life-threatening accident at a young age transformed me. Afterwards, I had no more illusions about my mortality or the sacredness of time. I discovered a new urgency to live well. My long-term goals came front and center.

From my accident I learned that the smallest choices made while in crisis significantly influence our futures — even more so than during the ordinary times of life. Each moment matters. The potential of time is magnified. How we handle tough times really does define us.

Opinion

Now, our entire society is in crisis as we scramble to survive the coronavirus pandemic. None of us have clarity about when this will end. What we do during these days is crucial to our futures.

As I write this, I am in day 36 of “sheltering in place.” As I adjust to this reality, I notice that the little choices I make are transforming me. I tidy my bedroom more. I finally bought a watch, hoping to look at my phone less. Although this may be mundane, I wonder how these new habits will change me.

I was curious whether others were forming new habits too; if anyone else was finding themselves using time differently. So I asked my Twitter followers, “What new thing are you doing now in quarantine that you hope to keep doing after this madness ends?”

I found that some people are using this time to nurture their creative sides. One friend is learning new folk songs with her partner. Others are learning to play classical masterpieces. One woman told me she is writing her memoirs for her grandchildren.

I noticed that others “sheltering in place” are developing their domestic sides. Some are cleaning more. Many people are organizing their pantries and baking so much bread the stores are on short on yeast.

With death counts in the daily headlines, we are more aware of the sacredness of our relationships. Parents are, by necessity, becoming more involved with the education of their kids, sometimes learning alongside them. We’re talking on the phone more. We are even writing letters again.

Amid the anxiety and fear, we recognize this time as an opportunity to redefine who we are. We can restructure how we live our lives —and this can be both a challenge and a gift.

The writer Jessica Mesman tweeted that this crisis has graced her with is a different understanding of time: “I no longer feel rushed. Time has elongated. There seems like there will be time for everything. That’s unnerving but it’s also showing me how much of my busy-ness was self-imposed.”

Now that time has been rearranged we have choices to make. We each have a chance to decide: who do I want to be during and after this crisis and how can I use time differently in order to become that person?

While life is taking on a new structure, new habits are being established and priorities being revealed — along the way we are becoming new people. Many of us are living through profound trauma and grief. But we might also become more grounded and connected; more intentional, authentic and emotionally healthy. During this crisis, we can all change for the better.

89,89,134,I wanna dance with somebody (on Instagram),"Kristin Childers went to a dance party on Saturday in her pajamas. The clothes didn’t matter, because she never left her living room. The party took place entirely on Instagram.

A few minutes before, she’d been sitting on her couch reading the news, feeling like she was about to cry. Then she got a notification on her phone: Ryan Heffington, the two-time Grammy nominated choreographer behind Sia’s “Chandelier” music video, was streaming a dance class on Instagram Live. “The numbness I was feeling just went away,” she says. “I was like, ‘I’m just gonna do it.’”

As Childers danced, she saw comments and hearts pop up on the live stream. Almost 2,700 people were dancing virtually alongside her. “I was like, ‘Wow people are really connecting,’” she says. She’d had low-grade anxiety since the coronavirus pandemic started spreading across the United States. Now, moving alone in her apartment with only her phone to keep her company, she felt almost optimistic.

“The numbness I was feeling just went away.”

Heffington is part of a wave of dance teachers moving their classes online as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread. In California, where a shelter order has been in place since March 19th, all non-essential businesses — including Heffington’s studio The Sweat Spot — are closed. The result is a rise in social media offerings as people look to their phones to give them a sense of community and help them stay active during the crisis.

But Heffington is well suited to lead the digital dance era. He’s high energy and describes himself as spiritual. His philosophy is that anyone can dance — and anywhere, apparently. “I feel like this is my calling in life,” he says. “I’ve always wanted to make the world dance, and apparently this is the right time to make that happen.”

When Heffington live steamed his first class on March 17th, 500 people showed up. The following weekend, there were close to 4,000. “People that have always been intimidated now have the privacy to dance and are loving it,” he says. “The insecurity level drops considerably because they’re in their own homes.”

Heffington’s classes aren’t the only ones to go online. Dance Church, which calls itself “the dance party you wish you had last night,” is also streaming dance parties. Founded by choreographer Kate Wallich, it typically hosts weekly classes in New York, Seattle, Portland, and Los Angeles. Now it’s gone fully digital, streaming on its own platform. Over the weekend, 10,000 people logged on.

Taiana Giefer, a Santa Barbara-based model and artist, is hosting dances on Zoom. She posts the link on social media, then DJs a class that anyone can tune into. She calls them social distancing dance parties.

To Heffington, this is proof that the pandemic is an opportunity for people to come together. “The crisis is showing us how we should function as a society,” he says. “This is what social media was designed for. It’s separated us in some aspects, but at this point in time, it’s kind of all we have, and it’s so beautiful.”

From her living room, Childers agrees. She’s figured out how to project her phone onto her TV, and pushed back her couch to have more space to dance. “Ryan’s next classes are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday this week, and I’m going to all of them,” she says. “Why not? I’m going to dance my way through this crisis.”",1
1031,1031,1227,Feds warn of attacks related to bogus COVID-19 conspiracy theory,"What started as a bizarre and bogus conspiracy theory involving the novel coronavirus in Britain has apparently crossed the Atlantic Ocean, U.S. law enforcement officials believe, and they are now increasingly worried about the possibility for real-world violence.

“We assess conspiracy theories linking the spread of COVID-19 to the expansion of the 5G cellular network are inciting attacks against the communications infrastructure globally and that these threats probably will increase as the disease continues to spread, including calls for violence against telecommunications workers,” the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported Wednesday in an intelligence report obtained by ABC News.

“Violent extremists have drawn from misinformation campaigns online that claim wireless infrastructure is deleterious to human health and helps spread COVID-19, resulting in a global effort by like-minded individuals to share operational guidance and justification for conducting attacks against 5G infrastructure, some of which have already prompted arson and physical attacks against cell towers in several US states,” the report concluded.

Wires of a telecommunications mast damaged by fire are seen in Sparkhill in Birmingham, Britain, April 6, 2020. Carl Recine/Reuters, FILE

The assessment was followed on Thursday by a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the FBI, DHS and the National Counterterrorism Center. Both documents were distributed to senior federal officials and law enforcement agencies around the country.

The federal officials who wrote the DHS analysis could not be more pointed about the seriousness of their concerns, saying the bulletin was “intended to highlight targeting and attacks globally against critical infrastructure during the COVID-19 pandemic and advise of online threats against critical infrastructure made by individuals including domestic violent extremists in the United States and others possibly driven by conspiracy theories. Critical infrastructure has been a longstanding target of (domestic terrorists) and current targeting observed appears to be focused primarily on locations associated with the (5G network) and the electric grid.”

The conspiracy theory is totally bogus and has zero connection to legitimate science, according to numerous experts who have researched the question and have been interviewed by ABC News. Once confined to the fringe of the internet, the theory says coronavirus is caused or spread by 5G technology, which is being constructed throughout Western Europe and the US as a means of improving phone and computer communications.

Eileen Culloty, a researcher specializing in countering disinformation at Dublin City University, told ABC News last month that “theories about 5G have been around for years, but were mostly confined to the fringes… For some people, the dramatic upheaval of COVID-19 demands an equally dramatic explanation. That’s the core appeal of a conspiracy theory -- it reduces complexity and coincidence into a simple narrative and points at someone or something to blame.”

As the pandemic first began to appear outside of China early this year, fears were heightened among law enforcement when a series of cell towers around Britain were targeted in unexplained arson attacks. By mid-April officials in the UK and US agreed the attacks were likely the result of the online paranoia having jumped from the screen to the real world.

Similar incidents have now been reported in the U.S., according to the federal documents.

“Since December 2019, unidentified actors conducted at least five arson incidents targeting cell towers in Memphis, Tenn., that resulted in more than $100,000 in damages,” the DHS reports say. “Additionally, 14 cell towers in western Tennessee, between February and April, were purposely turned off by way of disabling their electrical breakers,"" according to separate DHS field intelligence reporting. In April, arsonists set fire to a major cell tower in Portland, Ore., damaging electrical components at the base of the structure.”

Internationally, incidents were also reported in Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, according to the documents obtained by ABC News. On top of that, union officials in England reported that “telecommunications workers have been threatened with physical violence in light of conspiracy theories linking 5G networks to the spread of COVID-19.”

The chatter about 5G towers boiled over into an April 22 Facebook posting that “encouraged individuals associated with anarchist extremist ideology to commit acts of sabotage by attacking buildings and 5G towers around the world…in furtherance of an ‘International Day of Sabotage,’” the bulletin said.

Videos have also been posted online, showing people how to damage or destroy cell towers, according to the bulletin.

While many try to dismiss internet craziness as words without significance, experts fear the arson incidents could become another conspiracy like “Pizzagate,” which circulated during the 2016 presidential election campaign. In that case, false allegations that a Washington, D.C., pizzeria was a front for a human-trafficking and a child-sex ring were spread online by a number of far-right commentators, leading ultimately to a shooting without injuries at the restaurant in 2016. The shooter later told authorities he went to the restaurant to rescue the “victims” he had heard about.

The 5G conspiracy, unlike Pizzagate, has attracted people from across the political and ideological spectrum, according to intelligence analysts.

“We are seeing more people spreading these conspiracies, but equally disturbing is that more Americans seem to be believing them,” said ABC News contributor John Cohen, who used to oversee DHS intelligence operations as the acting undersecretary of the department. “In some cases, those people that believe the conspiracy theories commit destructive and violent acts as a result. This can be dangerous.”",1
997,997,1192,11 questions to ask your lender when deferring mortgage payments during the coronavirus,"Asking your lender about the mortgage deferral process can help you understand what you're getting into — and maybe even decide whether you want to enroll.

You should ask about the basics, including the dates of your deferral period, interest rates, and late fees.

Ask how deferral could impact your credit score, property taxes, and homeowners insurance.

If possible, get the terms of your deferral in writing and jot down your ticket number and the customer service agent's name so you can dispute any issues that may come up later.

As millions of Americans lose work due to the coronavirus, mortgage lenders are stepping up and offering assistance. You may be able to defer mortgage payments so that you don't lose your home if you can't pay right now.

There are no hard and fast rules about how lenders should handle mortgage deferrals — so when you set up your deferral, be sure to ask questions about how the process will play out.

If you're on the fence about deferring, the answers to these questions could help you decide whether it's the right move for you. If you know you need to defer payments to make ends meet, asking these questions will help you know what to expect.

11 questions to ask your lender when deferring mortgage payments during the coronavirus

1. Do I qualify for deferment?

First things first: Is deferment even an option?

Some lenders will ask for proof of economic hardship, including pay stubs or a letter from your employer. Others will accept your application without asking follow-up questions.

2. How long will my deferment period last?

If you have a government-backed loan through Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, FHA, USDA, or VA, you should be able to request up to 180 days of forbearance — and then ask for another 180-day extension if you're still financially struggling after your initial deferral period.

If you don't have a government-backed mortgage, you'll have to adhere to the lender's policy about deferral period lengths. Be sure to ask how long deferral lasts and whether the company considers extensions if you still can't make payments when your deferral ends.

3. What are the exact dates of my deferral period?

You may know your mortgage is deferred for three months, 120 days, or 180 days — but what are the exact dates? When will you have to make your next payment?

Write these dates down so you don't misunderstand and miss a payment later, only to be slammed with a late fee. Also, if you find out the deferral period is retroactive, you may be able to receive a refund for your most recent payment.

4. Will deferring hurt my credit score?

Many lenders have issued statements saying they won't report forbearance, missed payments, or late payments to credit bureaus so your credit score can stay in tact. But considering your credit score holds a lot of borrowing and buying power, it's good to double-check before you enroll in forbearance.

5. Will I be charged late fees?

Few lenders are penalizing people with late fees during the pandemic, but double-check to be sure.

6. Will interest continue to accrue?

Even though lenders are pausing mortgage payments, it's rare for them to suspend interest on your loan. Ask whether interest will continue to build and discuss how that could practically affect your loan.

7. When and how do I have to pay back the deferred amount?

The repayment process is probably the most confusing aspect of enrolling in mortgage deferral during the coronavirus pandemic. Some lenders offer just one repayment option, while others provide multiple choices. Here are the most common methods:

Repay the deferred amount in one lump sum once your deferral period ends.

Tack the missed payments onto the end of your loan term. For example, if you defer payments for three months, your loan term switches from 30 years to 30 years and three months.

Spread the deferred amount across the life of your mortgage so that your monthly payment increases.

If your mortgage is backed by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, you can request a specific repayment method beginning July 1, 2020: Make one lump sum payment when your mortgage term ends. This means you pay the total deferred amount when you sell or refinance your home, or when you pay off the home completely.

8. Will deferral hurt my chances of getting financing in the near future?

Even during the pandemic, deferral is often a sign of economic hardship. As a result, many lenders won't offer additional home financing if you enroll in deferral — at least not until you prove yourself to be a responsible borrower again, which could take months.

This means you could struggle to refinance or buy another home in the next year or so.

There's no concrete rule about lending after deferral during the coronavirus outbreak, so it's possible your lender will make an exception. Don't be afraid to ask upfront.

9. How will deferral affect my taxes and insurance?

Some people pay their property taxes and insurance separately from their mortgages, while others bundle it all into one payment. Ask your lender if you still have to pay taxes and insurance while your mortgage is in deferral, or if you can pause all these expenses.

10. Can I get this agreement in writing?

Customer service agents are human — it's possible they'll tell you incorrect information.

Maybe your lender says it won't report deferral to credit bureaus, but you see it pop up on your credit report and your score plummets. Or you get hit with a late fee even after a customer support representative said there wouldn't be any penalties.

In these cases, having an email or letter with the terms of your deferral can help you dispute issues.

11. Can I have your name and/or my ticket number?

If you face penalties or your credit score is docked even though the customer service agent said there wouldn't be a problem, having their name on hand could give your argument more validity.

Many customer service departments assign emails and chat sessions ""ticket numbers,"" so knowing yours can help you resolve a problem more quickly later.",1
2,2,2,Everything you need to know about the coronavirus,"Public health experts around the globe are scrambling to understand, track, and contain a new virus that appeared in Wuhan, China, at the beginning of December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease caused by the virus COVID-19, which references the type of virus and the year it emerged. The WHO declared that the virus is a pandemic.

The Verge is regularly updating this page with all the latest news and analysis.

You can see where and how many cases of the illness have been reported in this map. The majority of the illnesses were initially in China, where the virus first emerged, but the rate of new cases there has nearly stopped. There are now many times more cases outside of China than there were inside of it at the height of the outbreak. There are large outbreaks of the disease in multiple places, including Spain, Italy, and the United States, which currently has the worst outbreak of any country in the world.

As this important story continues to unfold, our hope is to answer all of your questions as people work to understand this virus and contain its spread.

Table of contents

Where did the virus come from?

At the end of December, public health officials from China informed the World Health Organization that they had a problem: an unknown, new virus was causing pneumonia-like illness in the city of Wuhan. They quickly determined that it was a coronavirus and that it was rapidly spreading through and outside of Wuhan.

Coronaviruses are common in animals of all kinds, and they sometimes can evolve into forms that can infect humans. Since the start of the century, two other coronaviruses have jumped to humans, causing the SARS outbreak in 2002 and the MERS outbreak in 2012.

Scientists think this new virus first became capable of jumping to humans at the beginning of December. It originally seemed like the virus first infected people at a seafood market in Wuhan and spread from there. But one analysis of early cases of the illness, published on January 24th, found that the first patient to get sick did not have any contact with the market. Experts are still trying to trace the outbreak back to its source.

The type of animal the virus originated from is not clear, although one analysis found that the genetic sequence of the new virus is 96 percent identical to one coronavirus found in bats. Both SARS and MERS originated in bats.

Where is it spreading?

The virus is now spreading all over the world.

Although it originated in China, the country took aggressive action at the start of the outbreak, shutting down transportation in some cities and suspending public gatherings. Officials isolated sick people and aggressively tracked their contacts, and had a dedicated network of hospitals to test for the virus.

Now, the epicenter of the pandemic is in the US, which has more cases than any country in the world. New York City has the highest number of cases in the country. Previous US hot spots included a nursing home in Washington; New Rochelle, New York; and the Boston area, where the disease spread at a conference.

There are over 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the US.

How dangerous is this new virus?

It takes information about both how severe an illness is and how easily it can spread to determine how “bad” it can be. Epidemiologists often use this tool to assess new strains of the flu, for example:

If an illness isn’t very severe (and kills only a small percentage of people), but it’s highly transmissible, it can still be devastating. An easily transmitted illness that kills a small percentage of the people it infects can still cause a lot of deaths, precisely because so many people get sick.

The WHO named the illness caused by the coronavirus COVID-19 — “co” and “vi” for coronavirus, “d” for disease, and “19” for the year when the disease emerged.

COVID-19 is a serious illness, and it’s much more dangerous than the flu. One Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) projection suggests that between 160 to 214 million people will be infected in the US, and that between 200,000 and 1.7 million could die. That doesn’t take into account actions taken to slow down the outbreak, though.

The symptoms of COVID-19 have ranged from mild, like those in a cold, to severe. Around 80 percent of confirmed cases are mild and don’t require hospitalization — at least, 80 percent of the cases that we know about. It’s still possible that there are more mild cases of the illness that haven’t been flagged, which would shrink the percentage of cases that are severe. In about 15 percent of people, the illness is severe enough that they need to be hospitalized, and about 5 percent of cases are critical. It appears around half of the people with critical cases of the illness die from it.

So far, experts say that around 1 percent of people who get sick with COVID-19 will die, though it’s too early to say for sure how often it is fatal. Those numbers may change as the outbreak progresses, and will be different in different places, depending on the demographics of the population. By comparison, 14 to 15 percent of people who got sick from SARS died.

Different groups of people, though, are more at risk of having a severe case of the illness or of dying from it. Most deaths in this outbreak have been in older people and those who have underlying health issues, like heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. In that group, people are more at risk of dying. Around 14 percent of people over the age of 80 who get sick will die, for example.

How easily can the virus spread?

The virus moves rapidly. The new coronavirus spreads quickly in contained environments, like on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

Early evidence suggested that, like other coronaviruses, the virus jumps between people who are in very close contact with each other. It also probably spreads when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Coughs and sneezes produce little droplets of mucus and saliva. If these droplets make it into another person’s eyes, mouth, or nose, they can get sick. The viruses in those little droplets can also fall onto surfaces, like tables or doorknobs — if someone touches that surface and touches their eyes, mouth, or nose, they can also get sick.

Early research shows that the virus can linger on surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel for a few days, which is why it’s important to clean countertops, doorknobs, and other places people touch regularly. The virus doesn’t appear to stay infectious on cardboard for longer than a day, so packages should be fairly safe.

Scientists are still trying to figure out how long tiny droplets containing virus could linger in the air if a sick person coughs or sneezes, or when they breathe or talk. They know that certain procedures done in the hospital can spray the virus into the air, where it can linger for a few hours, which is why it’s so important for doctors and nurses doing those procedures to have masks that can filter it out. But it’s still not clear how much the virus stays in the air normally without those artificial interventions.

We also don’t know when people with COVID-19 become contagious or how long being contagious lasts. One study of nine people in Germany with mild cases of the illness found that they had high levels of the virus in their throats early on in the course of the disease, before they felt very sick. Research out of China showed that people without symptoms still have high levels of the virus in their throats and noses, so they may be passing it along if they cough or sneeze.

The WHO says that people appear to be able to spread the virus for up to three days before they start showing symptoms, and preliminary research suggests that people without symptoms or mild, almost unnoticeable symptoms may be driving the epidemic. At a nursing home in Washington state, 13 of 23 people who tested positive for the virus at one point did not yet have symptoms.

Each sick person will go on to infect, on average, between 1.4 and 2.5 additional people, the WHO says, though that’s an early estimate. Other teams of researchers have published their own estimates, with most saying a sick person will infect an average of around two or three people.

Those numbers are called the virus’s R0 (pronounced “R-naught”). The R0 is the mathematical representation of how well an infection might be able to spread. The higher the number, the easier the disease is to spread. For comparison, the R0 for SARS was between two and five. But that doesn’t mean each sick person will actually infect that many people; quarantines and other actions taken to control outbreaks of a virus can bring down the number of people a sick person infects.

Can we treat this virus?

There aren’t any proven treatments for COVID-19, but there are dozens of studies underway to find some. One leading candidate is remdesivir, an antiviral medication originally developed to treat Ebola. There are clinical trials testing it in patients in China, in the US, and around the world. While there’s a lot of hype around the anti-malaria medication chloroquine, there’s still no evidence it — or any other drug — actually works.

Research teams and pharmaceutical companies are also working to develop a vaccine that can protect people from infection. However, vaccine development takes a long time. Even if everything goes smoothly, it will be around a year to 18 months before one is available, said Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

What can I do to protect myself and others?

Stay home as much as possible, especially if you’re feeling sick. Stay home even if you’re not feeling sick — evidence suggests people can be contagious even if they don’t have symptoms. Wash your hands, wipe down surfaces with disinfectant, and cover your mouth if you cough.

You can also wear cloth masks or face coverings when you’re out in public, especially in places where it’s hard to stay far away from others. Don’t go out and buy medical-grade masks because doctors and nurses need those. But wearing a cloth face covering could help stop you virus-laden particles to other people, even if you don’t know you’re sick.

If you’re a young, healthy person, you might not feel very sick if you catch COVID-19. But if you don’t stay home and away from others, you could pass it on to someone older or with a chronic health condition who is more likely to have a severe case of the disease.

One of the best ways to slow the spread of an outbreak is by staying away from other people, which is also called “social distancing.” That gives a virus less opportunity to jump from person to person. It’s why everyone is being asked to stay home. Those measures help blunt the impact of an outbreak by slowing the virus. If fewer people get sick at once, it’s easier for health care providers to give everyone good care.

If I already had COVID-19, am I immune?

Many researchers think that after someone is infected with the coronavirus, there’s a good chance that person won’t get sick from the virus again for some still-undetermined amount of time. That’s based on what scientists know about how most viruses work. Usually, when you’re sick from a viral infection, your body develops antibodies against that virus. The next time you’re exposed to the virus, those antibodies could stop it from turning into a raging illness — though that isn’t always the case.

There isn’t concrete evidence that people who got sick once with COVID-19 can’t get sick again because no studies have specifically tested that idea. But virologists don’t think that this virus behaves differently than most other viruses — so people who did get sick are probably protected. The question, though, is for how long: for some viruses, the protection fades after a year or a few years. There aren’t answers to that question yet.

Some doctors in China and South Korea have reported that some patients who were sick with COVID-19 and recovered tested positive for the virus a second time. That probably doesn’t mean they were re-infected, though, and doesn’t mean that people can get sick more than once in a short period of time. Instead, it probably means that there were still tiny bits of virus lingering in their nose and throat — not enough to make them sick, and probably not enough to make other people sick, but enough to trigger a positive test. It could also mean that the patients’ initial, negative tests after they felt better were false negatives, which happen frequently.

What’s happening in the US?

US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar declared a public health emergency in response to the coronavirus at the end of January, and President Trump declared a federal emergency in March.

The virus is spreading through the country, and dozens of states and counties have made emergency declarations. Hotspots include Louisiana and New York. It may have been spreading in Washington and other states for weeks before it was first detected.

As the case counts shoot up, governors and local officials have closed nonessential businesses and told people to work from home and stay away from others. Hospitals in New York City and other places are buckling under the strain of hundreds of critically ill people; they’re running short on protective equipment for nurses and ventilators to help patients breathe. The interventions are helping to slow the spread of the disease in some areas.

The virus spread undetected because CDC guidelines originally did not allow testing unless a sick person had been in a country with an ongoing spread of the virus or who had been in contact with someone with a confirmed case of the disease could be tested. That delayed the diagnosis of patients who did not have those risk factors. They’ve since updated the guidance to say that doctors can use their best judgment to decide if the patient should be tested.

Public health experts are struggling to slow the spread of disease in part because there are still a limited number of tests available. It took too long for the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC to develop and distribute a functioning test, and longer still for testing capacity to increase. In addition, public health agencies across the country don’t have the resources to get in touch with everyone who tests positive and find the people they may have exposed — a critical public health tool called contact tracing.

Experts say that the US needs to dramatically increase the number of tests done each week and scale up the contact tracing workforce in order to control the outbreak.

The US currently has the worst outbreak of any country in the world.",1
303,303,386,Microsoft launches ‘Plasma Bot’ to recruit recovered COVID-19 patients to help treat sick ones,"Microsoft is launching a self-screening tool for people to check whether they qualify to donate their plasma in the hopes of creating a treatment for those with COVID-19, according to a company blog post. The tool is part of the company’s work with a group called the CoVig-19 Plasma Alliance.

When someone is infected with a virus, their immune system produces antibodies to fight it. Once the infected person recovers, they have these antibodies in their blood.

“The sooner recovered COVID-19 patients donate convalescent plasma, the sooner the Alliance may be able to start manufacturing a potential therapy and begin clinical trials,” according to the post. “These trials will determine if this therapy could treat patients who are at risk for serious complications from COVID-19.”

Plasma infusions have helped some COVID-19 patients’ recovery time, early research has found

Giving the antibody-infused blood plasma of a recovered person to a newly infected person who may not have antibodies yet might help the sick person recover faster. This isn’t a new treatment; it was used to treat diphtheria in the 1890s and used — effectively — during the 1918 flu pandemic. Plasma infusions also have been used to treat people with diseases like SARS, measles, and chickenpox.

With COVID-19, some early information suggests plasma infusions have helped some patients’ recovery time, but it’s still too early to tell how effective the treatment is. Researchers in the US continue to run controlled studies on plasma infusion treatments for COVID-19 patients.

The Plasma Alliance’s goal is different from some other plasma-related initiatives; rather than focusing on giving plasma transfusions directly to infected patients, the alliance wants to make a therapy called a polyclonal hyperimmune globulin (H-Ig).

The process pools together multiple donations of plasma. Then, the antibodies are concentrated into a liquid form, which the researchers will try to use to create a medication that can treat the virus. The therapy would have to go through clinical trials before being approved to treat COVID-19 patients.

The CoVIg-19 Plasma Bot, which Microsoft says it expects to make available through web, social, and search channels, asks a series of questions to see if a user is able to donate plasma, including medications they are taking, allergies, and other medical conditions.

If they’re eligible, users will get information about where to donate their plasma, which takes about an hour, according to the alliance. They’ll begin recruiting in the US with plans to expand to Europe.

In addition to Microsoft, the alliance includes Biotest, BPL, LFB, Octapharma, CSL Behring, and Takeda. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is an adviser of the project.",1
694,694,850,Rock and Roll Hall of Fame museum set for June reopening,"The coronavirus didn’t stop the music, but it did shut down the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame museum to visitors.

That will change soon. The Cleveland museum plans to reopen as soon as June 15, Rock Hall President and CEO Greg Harris told USA TODAY on Wednesday.

Harris said the museum would create a safe environment, but not a sterile one.

“We need to keep the DNA of rock and roll,” he said.

Nearly 600,000 visitors annually pass through the doors of the museum, which opened in September 1995. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, it’s been closed since March 14.

When the museum reopens, the visitor experience will be different. Harris said all tickets will be digital, and visitors will register for a time slot to enter the museum.

At the entrance, visitors will go to a tented area where nurses will take their temperature. Visitors will be scanned in to enter, and will be required to wear face coverings.

Employees will wear masks, as well. Hand sanitizer will be available, and museum staff will wipe down surfaces frequently. All touch screens will be covered, and interactive exhibits, such as one where visitors can play musical instruments, will remain closed.

Visitor traffic through the museum will move in one direction. The cafe and gift shop will be open following state guidelines for social distancing.

“We want to provide an environment that is safe as possible,” Harris said.

Harris said an infectious disease specialist from the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic will be on site.

The goal is to operate the museum at about 50% capacity, Harris said. The museum will reopen with shorter hours — 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. — to allow for extra cleaning and disinfecting. Certain hours will be reserved for at-risk populations, including seniors and people with chronic conditions.

Harris said the facility is keeping a close eye on museums in the region and nationwide, and he’s been in contact with Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine.

“We’re going to be very measured as we start,” Harris said.

While digital tickets are not currently available to purchase, Harris said he expects to announce when they’ll go on sale by June 1.

Harris said he hopes to bring back food trucks and beer gardens to the museum’s plaza. Live music will resume, though initially with soloists instead of bands.

There will also be a day reserved just for medical professionals and emergency personnel who have been on the front lines of the coronavirus response.

Some of the museum’s employees will continue to work remotely, and others who were furloughed will be called back as they’re needed. Harris said he continued to pay for health insurance for the furloughed employees.

As for the 2020 Hall of Fame induction ceremony, rescheduled for Nov. 7, Harris said no determination has been made about how the event will proceed.

“We’re holding the date,” he said.

The Doobie Brothers, Whitney Houston, Nine Inch Nails, Depeche Mode, The Notorious B.I.G. and T. Rex are among this year’s inductees.

A lot will depend on how large-attendance gatherings such as sports events and concerts will be handled in the coming months, Harris said.

Harris calls the Rock Hall “the most powerful museum in the entire world” because visitors come to it with a reservoir of memories connected to what’s in the building.

That could be a first love, a breakup or a memorable concert.

“It all comes out through the triggers in our museum,” he said. “Our goal is to deliver that same experience when we’re adhering to all these health and safety protocols.”

1084,1084,1300,Coronavirus: Hotels in Italy await tourists amid pandemic,"A table for one?

It's the creative concept that an Ocean City, Maryland, restaurant unveiled over the weekend to keep patrons at least 6 feet apart once the governor gave the OK for restaurants and bars to reopen.

Shaped like oversized inner tubes, the tables were custom made for Fish Tales, where employees rolled them out of a large box truck for their Facebook live debut over the weekend, reports the Salisbury Daily Times, which is a part of the USA TODAY Network.

What restrictions are in place? What to expect in Ocean City as beach, boardwalk reopen

One week after reopening:Ocean City packed on sunny Saturday

""It's like a bumper boat, but it's actually a table,"" owner Shawn Harmon said of the design, which was developed by Revolution Event Design and Production in Baltimore.

A customer will stand in the center of the circular table surrounded by a rubber barrier that keeps them safely separated from other patrons in accordance with social distancing guidelines. The tables sit on wheels that allow them to stay mobile.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had restaurants and bars across Maryland shuttered – with the exception of carryout and delivery service – since mid-March in an effort to curb the virus's spread.

Now that the state has eased into stage one of its gradual Roadmap to Recovery, eateries are itching to one day soon hopefully resume dine-in service.

Fish Tales is providing curbside and carryout service seven days a week and has also put significant distance between its outdoor tables in anticipation of being able to wait on patrons again.

""We've taken this very seriously from the beginning, and we just want to let everyone know what we've done in the interim to make sure that everybody stays safe and Ocean City can stay open,"" Harmon said in a social media video about the measures the establishment has taken.

721,721,879,"Politicians pushing to reopen faster are ‘idiots,’ says expert, blaming those not following rules for continued rise in COVID-19 cases","An infectious disease expert from Chicago has a simple explanation for why the number of COVID-19 cases has continued to mount after strict social restrictions have been in place for nearly two months: “People aren’t following the rules.”

Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of Northwestern University’s Institute of Global Health, warned that those disobeying the statewide stay-at-home order are exacerbating the public health crisis as he blasted the forces pushing to immediately reopen the economy.

“Look on the street. Only half of the people are wearing a mask,” Murphy said Wednesday. “There’s data from the phone companies about how people move. They’re moving around more. There’s definitely more traffic.”

While he said the pervasive toll is also attributable in part to increased testing and workers returning to their jobs, Murphy noted that keeping social distancing measures in place longer — and following them — is vitally important for beating back the coronavirus.

Recent figures have shown the disease is still spreading rapidly through communities. On Tuesday, state officials reported 4,014 new cases of COVID-19, the most recorded in a single day. And on Wednesday, the 192 reported deaths marked another grim benchmark.

“The same thing happened in northern Italy and in Spain, where they just felt like they were not getting ahead,” Murphy said. “It finally turned around there when they got serious with all the shelter-in-place.

“But I mean, everybody here seems to be just ready to chuck it and just go back to doing what they’re doing.”

Murphy specifically took aim at leaders pushing to relax restrictions locally. As he sees it, the clearest way to vanquish the disease is actually to “tighten it up.”

“They should not be loosening up. You know, like McHenry County and DuPage County want to have their own rules. Idiots!” he said, apparently referencing a push by leaders in the collar counties to be moved into a region in the governor’s Restore Illinois plan that doesn’t include Cook County in hopes they can reopen businesses sooner.

Meanwhile, both Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike spent a good portion of Wednesday’s news conference harping on the fact that the virus remains a real and serious threat.

“This virus is still among us,” Pritzker said. “This pandemic is not over. And to pretend otherwise in a misguided attempt to reclaim what we’ve lost will only make this last longer.”

But even Murphy, a noted expert on infectious diseases, is struggling to truly understand the disease that has killed thousands across the state.

“Some places have turned it around, so what are we doing wrong? What else do we have to do? That’s what we have to figure out.”",1
593,593,724,Why high school juniors could be big losers in the coronavirus pandemic,"High school juniors may find themselves at a disadvantage when they apply to college next year.

With many current seniors looking to defer college admission for a year, there may be less spots available for the class of 2021.

Juniors are also set to miss out on the activities that often help distinguish an application, like extracurriculars and jobs.

Low-income students may be disproportionately impacted, especially if SAT testing moves online.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The coronavirus pandemic has thrown many current and soon-to-be collegiate careers into disarray, but some of the biggest losers have been a relative afterthought so far: the juniors who haven't even applied yet.

The reason why has to do with all the seniors who, heading into an uncertain collegiate future, may opt to take a gap year instead of enrolling as planned.

""Almost all of my students who have been admitted to top-tier colleges are reconsidering their plans for this upcoming academic year, with some submitting gap year request forms to delay the start of their freshman year so that they can have the full college experience,"" college admissions consultant Christopher Rim, the CEO of Command Education, previously told Business Insider.

If schools open online in the fall, 12% of high school seniors will take a gap year, according to a survey of 1,100 current high school seniors and college students by higher-ed research and marketing firm SimpsonScarborough.

And, according to a Niche survey of 34,392 high school seniors, 7% of school seniors are considering deferring for a year or not enrolling.

For other students, deferring or not attending next year may not be much of a choice. International students, for instance, face ever-changing travel restrictions. Foreign nationals traveling from China currently aren't allowed to enter the US — and China was the largest source of international students in the 2018-2019 school year.

All of those students deferring admission — and the international students who may not be allowed to travel — will hypothetically matriculate in 2021. That means that the class of 2021 could be competing with two years' worth of high schoolers for a college spot — and the class of 2020 has already secured theirs.

Fewer college enrollments in the fall — coupled with cancelled extracurriculars and opportunities — spells trouble for juniors

""The reality is that there's going to be fewer enrollments and fewer graduates, and it's going to take time to get that back on track,"" Luke Skurman, CEO and founder of Niche, told Business Insider in an email. ""Our recent survey shows that half of high school students are rethinking their college options and 9% are considering deferring their acceptance. That, combined with 26% of college students considering transferring or taking time off could lead to a devastating fall — but opens up the possibility of a much larger than usual spring and fall 2021 enrollment size for institutions who can weather the budgetary pain of the fall.""

Of course, as Rim previously noted, it's ""unclear"" how colleges will handle gap year requests — and what students would even be able to do during a deferred year.

Further compounding the plight of the juniors is the loss of what Rim calls a ""hook"" — something that helps them stand apart in an already crowded field. For many, that comes in the form of research or extracurriculars — most of which have been cancelled due to coronavirus closures. SAT tests have been cancelled through August, meaning students will get fewer opportunities to take the test or try and raise their scores.

And lower-income students will likely be disproportionately impacted. In losing access to school buildings and libraries, they may have lost their only chance of using a quiet study space and computer. Even having one computer may not be helpful if students need to share it with a parent working from home.

The Pew Research Center found that racial minorities, rural residents, and those with lower education and income levels are less likely to have internet connectivity. That could have devastating repercussions for prospective college applicants or SAT test-takers if tests move online.

As Rim notes, many lower-income students receive SAT tutoring through public schools. If tests do resume in-person in August, they'll still be left behind by the absence of that tutoring. And, while many schools have moved to make SAT tests optional for 2021 admissions, those lower-income students who do not send in scores will find themselves going head to head with more well-resourced students who did.

All of that adds up to a bleak picture for juniors: they'll have fewer opportunities to hone the profile that colleges look for — like jobs and extracurriculars — and will find themselves competing for a reduced amount of seats. And, in an already pitched battle to ensure equal access to opportunities in college, exaggerated socioeconomic differences during the crisis can make it harder for the ""have-nots"" to access good colleges.

The plight of the juniors only further illustrates the tentacle effect of the coronavirus pandemic: the aftershocks will shape American lives for years to come.",1
1101,1101,1327,Coronavirus makes everything worse for Pedro Sánchez,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1

Each year, the Eurovision Song Contest unites 180 million viewers in more than 40 countries for an electric-falsetto night of glitter, glam and hard-rock hallelujah.

This year, the coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of the contest for the first time in its 64-year history. But instead of leaving so many super fans dance-crying to the 1974 winner Waterloo (ABBA), the song contest has instead decided to air a live two-hour special, Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light, Saturday on public broadcasting channels in more than 40 countries. (The U.S. is not one of them, so anyone living in that country will have to watch on Eurovision's YouTube channel, where the show will be live-streamed.)

The show is hosted in the Netherlands, where the contest was supposed to be held this year at the Ahoy concert hall. (The venue has been converted into an emergency hospital for coronavirus patients). All 41 contestants will perform remotely, though this year fans won't be able to phone in their votes for the winner.

Eurovision Song Contest YouTube

The pre-pandemic 2020 favorites included the nerd-disco gem Think About Things by Iceland's Dadi og Gagnamagnid; the bodice-ripper Cleopatra by Azerbaijan's Efendi; and the auto-tuned hallucination jig that is Uno by Russia's Little Big.

In the weeks leading up to the show, several Eurovision performers past and present participated in sweet, low-key home concerts. Fans who missed the signature pyrotechnic drama also turned to Eurovision.TV to look up the vampire-opera ""It's My Life"" by Romania's super-soprano Cesar (2013) or the Hellenic solid-gold dancing in My Number One by Greece's Helena Paparizou, the 2005 winner.

The Eurovision song contest began in 1956 to bring together a continent shattered by World War II. Seven countries competed that first year, and the winner, Refrain by Switzerland's Lys Assia, is about lost love and innocence. The contest grew to include more countries, including those not in Europe, like Israel.

In the early years, performers were often backed by live orchestras. They sang in their native language: Vivo Cantando (1969), Hallelujah (1979), Ein bisschen Frieden (1982). As newlyweds in Athens in the 1970s, my parents lived next-door to the 1976 contestant from Greece, folk singer Mariza Koch, who sang this beautiful song in Greek. When I moved to Greece more than a decade ago, I befriended the 1995 contestant from Cyprus, who sang this Eurovision cult classic, also in Greek.

These days, it's mainly the French and Italians crooning in their native tongues, with these award-winning exceptions.

The Eurovision Song Contest has also expanded far beyond Europe and now includes Australia, though it did lose Hungary this year.

Hungary's national public broadcasting association said it wanted to focus its resources on ""Hungarian pop singers"" though one report said pro government media called the contest a ""homosexual flotilla."" Hungary has never won the contest but came in fourth in 1994 with this ballad sung by Friderika Bayer.

Many fans observing social distancing cannot hold Eurovision parties at home this year. Some made up for it with online watch parties, which involved tuning in remotely to watch reruns of previous contests. At Saturday night's Eurovision alternative, a featured performance will be the unity anthem Love Shine a Light by Katrina and the Waves, the 1997 winner. The super fans might sing along and also hope that ABBA will too.",1
90,90,135,Fashion influencers are rethinking their curated aesthetics because they can’t leave their houses,"Elizabeth Savetsky, an influencer who lives in New York, has kept her Instagram feed pristine up until now. In every past photo, she wears an enviable outfit with perfectly done hair and, occasionally, her smiling, tall plastic surgeon husband. They’re photos that make people wish they could live in her shoes. But things are changing now that she’s stuck at home because of social distancing: she can’t hire photographers, she isn’t attending events, and she’s dressing up for no one other than her family. Her posts are starting to reflect this new reality.

For the first time, Savetsky recorded herself singing, surprising her followers who likely had no idea she had a good voice. Last week, she posted a selfie showing off her natural, wavy hair and minimal makeup (though she did later delete it). Her most recent posts are one of her on the couch surrounded by snacks and an old photo with her mom in which she laments the days when they could hang.

Fashion influencers’ accounts might never be the same after the pandemic ends, and it’s already forcing them to adjust how they make content and what they post. Sure, they’re still receiving swag in the mail to produce unboxing and try-on videos, but they’re also grappling with the pandemic themselves and figuring out how their accounts should look. Do people still want to see cute outfits during a recession? How do you take a studio-quality photo when the only photographer available to you is your husband? What happens when you feel mentally and emotionally exhausted? The curated aesthetic people have railed against — which has defined much of Instagram up until now — might slowly disappear.

“It’s going to force us to be more creative,” Savetsky says. “I’ve been posting on Instagram for about seven years now, and so it’s nice to almost have this challenge that’s forcing me outside the box because we all tend to get into these habits of doing the same thing over and over again, shooting on the same street corner always, and we can’t do that anymore.”

Influencers hope to keep working with clothing brands, although those brands might shift from advertising going out attire to leggings or comfortable clothes. The photos they take are also going to be more off the cuff with minimal backdrops and whatever they can work with at home. The professional photographers are going away, too, as are the studios they rent to shoot.

The business will go on, though. Katie Sands, another influencer who runs both an Instagram account and fashion blog, sees the pandemic as an opportunity to have more honest, personality-driven conversations.

“I have had a bunch of followers reach out and say, ‘What do you think is going to happen to the blogosphere? Do you think blogging industry will go away?’ and I, personally, think it’s actually the opposite,” Sands says. “I think that it’s going to become stronger than ever. People, including myself, I’m looking to the creators I follow for different inspiration — for home recipes, for workouts, for work from home outfits, for beauty advice.”

Her Stories now include videos in which she dances with her dad because she’s social distancing in her parents’ home. She also tapes her boyfriend trying on swag she’s sent. Her videos are clearly made in her house. Sands is also going live on her page every Thursday with her therapist to help other people work through the stress and anxiety of a pandemic. One of her most recent posts is a video of her dancing in a kitchen, her phone clearly propped up against something. It’s not bad-looking, but it’s different than older photos of her laughing with friends or dressed up at a party, posing for a photographer.

Fashion influencers’ photos often look good because they hire professionals to help them shoot. That’s not the case while social distancing. Another influencer, Charlotte Bickley, says her mom now doubles as her photographer and will shoot her photos while they’re isolated in Florida.

“Obviously in this time everyone understands that they’re not going to be the most glamorous shots,” she says.

She also polled her followers on how they felt about her posting brand deals during this time, and the majority said they felt comfortable with it. “I do feel a little weird doing superficial things right now, just personally, I know my followers want to see it,” she says. “But I do feel a little weird to be honest.”

The logistics of those brand deals also have to be renegotiated. Sands says one of her agreements specifically requires her to take street photos, which she’s unable to do because of quarantine restrictions. Her brand partners are also putting deals on pause while they figure out their own strategies, which she understands, but it also means her income is limited.

“Like everyone else, my business has been hit so hard,” Sands says. “When the brands don’t want to do the partnership, when I’ve already allocated them into my monthly budget, it’s hard,”.

Sands says most brands have been receptive to hearing alternative ideas, like posting on Stories rather than the grid or finding a way to make the messaging cater to the situation at hand. Brands that aren’t on board are told to talk to her agent, she says. Still, she’s hoping she’ll be able to go back to posting more regularly this week. (Last week, she did promote a vitamin company in both her grid and Stories, angling it around the pandemonium COVID-19 has created.)

Granted, if the pandemic slows down and social distancing is lifted in only a few months, these influencers’ honest glimpses into their lives might go away, too. Followers will have gotten only a momentary peek into their favorite influencers’ actual lives.

“We’re in a serious time and it’s creating serious conversation,” Savetsky says. “I see a lot of my influencer friends going deeper than they usually would and posting different kinds of content. It’s going to change the industry for the better and make it less-curated and make it more relationship-based with influencer to follower.”",1

Social distancing, flattening the curve - they are phrases that a month ago didn't mean that much to most Americans. Now we hear them multiple times each day. Is social distancing working? When will the curve begin to flatten? They're questions that are asked over and over by officials, journalists, all of us living through this pandemic. We are going to spend the next several minutes trying to answer those questions about two parts of the country where the curve seems to be progressing very differently - California and New York. I'm joined now by NPR's Rebecca Hersher and John Ruwitch.

Welcome, you two.

JOHN RUWITCH, BYLINE: Hello.

REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Hello.

KELLY: Hi, so, Becky, you first. We keep hearing in New York the curve is going up and up and up. Is that holding true today?

HERSHER: Yes, we're seeing a lot of coronavirus cases in New York. Nearly 50,000 people have tested positive. Nearly 2,000 people have died in the city. Hospitals are full of people with severe cases of COVID-19. Some doctors and nurses are starting to get sick. And as the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said today, New York is still climbing the mountain.

KELLY: John, where you are in California, the curve is also going up but not quite so dramatically.

RUWITCH: Yeah. That's right. I mean, so far, California is not experiencing anything like what's happening in New York. The caseload here is a fraction of New York's today. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, announced that there were just over 8,100 confirmed cases in the state. And it's America's biggest state - right? - with about 40 million people. One thing to note is that California has been behind New York in terms of testing, so we don't really have the full picture. But experts and the government here are keeping track of hospitalizations and numbers of people in ICUs as sort of the key indicators. And those numbers are lower than New York's, too.

KELLY: And where you are in California, the Bay Area specifically, was one of the earliest parts of the country to issue a shelter-in-place order. So let me get to the why question. Is that early shelter-in-place order one possible reason why cases there seem to be progressing more slowly?

RUWITCH: Yeah. Doctors I've talked to here think the shelter in place has potentially been a big part of it. People here have certainly been taking it seriously - and it's worth noting - for over two weeks now, which is the outer limit of what people think the incubation period is for this virus. I'm in a town about 30, 40 minutes south of San Francisco. I'm on the balcony now, actually, overlooking the southern part of the San Francisco Bay. And this is anecdotal, but the visibility has been great over this - during this shelter-in-place period. But also, the 280 freeway, which is a major artery between San Jose and San Francisco, has had noticeably less cars on it.

I spoke with George Rutherford. He's a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics here at Stanford. He says things could look a lot worse here for sure, but there's just not enough data yet to say that we're out of the woods. Here's what he had to say.

GEORGE RUTHERFORD: Preliminary, very preliminary indications are that things seem like they're going in the right direction. But it could all change quickly, and we want to make sure everybody keeps doing what they've been doing.

RUWITCH: To that end, the counties and cities around the Bay Area here have just extended shelter in place through early May.

KELLY: All right. I'm going to try to suppress my jealousy at the view you are enjoying there looking out over the ocean. The view, at least, sounds really good. Becky, let me flip back to you and ask about what is driving the trajectory there in New York, which is also under stay-at-home orders. So how does that factor in?

HERSHER: Yeah. New York did issue its stay-at-home order slightly later than California and especially almost a week later than the Bay Area. And that may matter. It's too soon to know, though. What epidemiologists have told me about what's happening in New York - what's definitely important that we already know is important is the density. So you can just imagine people are living in buildings with a lot of other people, right? New York City, Manhattan, even the outer boroughs - they're extremely dense. And there's a huge reliance on mass transit.

So people - they're packed closer together. They're sharing more surfaces - elevator buttons and door handles and railings. Like, imagine getting food without a car, without touching anyone or anything. It's really hard. And authorities are trying to crack down. They announced today that they're closing city parks, trying to keep people more separated. But at the end of the day, when you live that densely packed, it's difficult to control the spread. And so when you look at the curve - and it's going up really steeply - that's part of what you're seeing.

KELLY: And you get some of the issues of just enforcement in a city like New York, where people are living in - a lot of them living in small apartments. And I was watching press briefings today where they were talking about closing playgrounds, as you mentioned, closing parks and just the difficulty of keeping people out, keeping people from congregating.

I want to flip to both of you with - for your take on this question before we go, which is that all of these projections for what might happen to the curve and when it will flatten - the projections are based on models. The models are only as good as the data fed into them. What are some of the assumptions for each city? Becky, you go first.

HERSHER: So one of the big things that the leading nationwide model assumes is that states that haven't put strict social distancing measures in place will do so within a week from now. And that's a big if, right? We can't say what governors will do. The other thing is it assumes that all states will keep the measures in place until June 1. That's a really long time. You know, the White House's guidelines have only been extended until the end of the month. And so that's a big assumption that's baked into all of these curves that we're looking at.

KELLY: And, John, how about in California?

RUWITCH: Yeah. In California, it's a similar situation. I mean, there's - the governor was speaking earlier today about preparing for a two-thirds increase in the number of hospital beds. And they showed various charts about which direction the epidemic will go. It's all dependent on people sheltering at home and hunkering down, basically. And as he said, you know, it's actions that are really going to affect the way this goes, not projections.

KELLY: All right. That is NPR's John Ruwitch reporting from a balcony in the Bay Area and Rebecca Hersher reporting on what's happening in New York.

Thanks so much, both of you.

RUWITCH: Thank you.

HERSHER: Thanks.
