826,826,995,I started my dream internship just as the coronavirus shut down the country. Here are 8 tips I learned about how new interns can make it through the crisis in one piece.,"Starting a new internship during the novel coronavirus pandemic can be overwhelming.

I've been working since mid-March as an intern at Insider — and I've been doing it remotely.

This has helped me pick up several essential lessons for succeeding in a virtual office, including the importance of thorough note-taking and why video check-ins with my managers and other interns are so crucial.

Here are 8 tips I have for any interns about to embark on a similar journey.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

When the novel coronavirus was deemed a pandemic in mid-March, I was halfway to New York from South Carolina to start an internship on the social media team at Insider Inc., the parent company of Business Insider. Suddenly, the concern I felt over first-day jitters and settling into my new team was superseded by questions like ""How long will this crisis last?"" and ""Will I ever make it into the office?""

My first weeks on the job as a fellow (the title used by paid interns on a six-month program at Insider) consisted of navigating the onboarding process in a completely remote setting and doing meet-and-greets with colleagues I would possibly never get the chance to know in person. However, despite the unprecedented nature in which I started my internship, I quickly found my footing and was able to turn an otherwise jarring situation into a learning opportunity.

In the two months I've been working remotely, I've become what I consider to be an expert in operating within a work-from-home environment.

Here are eight tips I have for any other interns about to embark on a similar journey, and how they can use them to succeed at their new roles while navigating the virtual office.",1
861,861,1032,Russia slams The New York Times and Financial Times over coronavirus death toll reports,"Moscow – Russia has criticized the Financial Times and The New York Times over their recent stories suggesting the country's death rate from COVID-19 could be much higher than officially reported, defending its methodology behind the official mortality numbers.

The publications pointed at open data showing increased mortality in Moscow and St. Petersburg last month compared to previous Aprils.

The Russian Foreign Ministry attacked the newspapers on Thursday, accusing them of ""disinformation,"" and demanding retractions. Russian lawmaker Vasily Piskaryov also demanded the publications be stripped of their press accreditation.

Vice president for communications for The New York Times, Danielle Rhoades Ha, said in a statement obtained by CBS News that the newspaper's report was accurate because it was based on ""publicly available government records and interviews with experts from government-run institutions.""

Russia has the second highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world after the United States, with more than 262,000 confirmed cases reported as of Friday. The country's official death toll, however, remains lower compared to other hard-hit countries: 2,418 COVID-19 deaths have been reported by Russian officials.

According to government data, Moscow registered over 1,700 more deaths overall last month compared to its April average over the past five years. The New York Times pointed out that that total is much higher than Russia's official coronavirus death count of 642 in Moscow for April.

The Financial Times reported a similar spike in total deaths reported in St. Petersburg in April, suggesting that the country could have 70% more coronavirus deaths than officially stated.

Neither publications have met the foreign ministry's demand for a retraction.

Moscow's Health Department reacted to the press reports on Wednesday with a statement saying that more than 60% of deaths among the city's coronavirus patients are not being included in the official virus death toll because their deaths resulted from underlying causes. Officials said autopsies are being conducted in all suspected coronavirus deaths, and defended their methodology as ""exceptionally precise.""

Russian officials have also claimed that the large scope of testing contributed to low mortality, allowing the detection of infections at early stages. According to the Russian healthcare watchdog, Rospotrebnadzor, 6.4 million COVID-19 tests have been done as of Friday.",1

On the night of March 30, just before 7 p.m., Dr. Ray Lorenzoni put on his face mask, walked across the street from the Bronx apartment he shares with his wife and started his shift at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center.

Lorenzoni, 35, is in his second year of a pediatric cardiology fellowship at the hospital. But this night, the patients would be different: It was his first shift treating adult coronavirus patients — the first adults he's treated in the hospital since medical school six years before.

""Coming into the hospital, it was a little bit unreal,"" he says. ""The whole floor was filled with adult patients.""

By then, COVID-19 cases systemwide at Montefiore Medical Center had gone from just two cases a little over two weeks earlier to more than 700. In response, Montefiore transformed part of the children's hospital into a 40-bed adult COVID unit. All around the city, other hospitals were making similar adjustments. Medical students graduated early. Operating rooms were converted into ICUs. A field hospital went up in Central Park.

But the surge in New York City has done much more than simply rearrange space and upend protocol. More than 15,000 people have died of COVID-19 there, and that enormous toll will profoundly impact the city's tens of thousands of health care workers for years to come. Lorenzoni is one of them.

A little over a month ago, Lorenzoni answered a request from NPR for hospital workers to describe what work was like at the epicenter of the crisis. Lorenzoni began recording his reflections for NPR after his shifts, sitting at the desk in his bedroom, speaking into his iPhone in a slow, measured voice.

Just a few weeks earlier, Lorenzoni had watched — along with many other Americans — how the Italian medical system had been brought to its knees. It seemed likely it was only a matter of when, not if, the coronavirus would arrive in the U.S. And of course, by then, it already had.

""I knew I could be involved because of what happened in Italy,"" Lorenzoni says, and adds, ""a pediatric physician needing to take care of critical adult patients is unheard of.""

Still, he was surprised he was recruited so early.

""They filled us up pretty quickly and the patients were very sick. I remember in the first couple shifts we were putting breathing tubes in patients on a floor that doesn't usually do that,"" he says.

Treating adults hit him hard, he says. He's used to working with kids.

""Pediatrics is a career where most of your patients get better,"" he says. ""But these were very with-it adults who were scared. They knew what the risk was.""

It felt important to him, he says, to be honest about what was happening, even when the news wasn't good.

""One of my main mantras is to sit down with somebody. And that was very tough in this environment because our protective equipment didn't surround us,"" he says. ""So we were discouraged from sitting down on the bed next to a patient to have a deep discussion or sitting down in a chair and being at eye level with the patient.""

Instead, he says he would do his best to give his patient a sense of comfort by leaning against the wall, trying not to stand over or talk down to them.

""I think patients can see right through a physician when they try to dance around a difficult conversation,"" he says. ""You can be honest with a person and they appreciate that honesty.""

One patient, a man in his mid-forties, kept asking how bad his condition was. As the man's health deteriorated, Lorenzoni was open with him, aware that those hard conversations — like what it means to be put on a ventilator — are sometimes the last a patient will ever have.

""I remember that he asked me, 'doc, I know I'm not getting better, what else can we do?' and unfortunately I had to answer that we'd been doing everything we could. And he broke down. And I broke down a little bit in tears,"" he says.

In his recordings, Lorenzoni lingered on the quieter moments. He spoke about why it was important to take time with his patients, especially because visitors were not allowed. One woman, in her early 30s, often wanted staff to check in on her, beyond the usual rounds that doctors and nurses make.

""I feel like she knew she wasn't doing well, and she wanted the company,"" Lorenzoni says.

When he would leave for the day, he'd check in on her to make sure she was okay, but he worried that she would take a turn for the worse by the time he returned.

Eventually, that's what happened. She needed to be placed on a ventilator to breathe.

""One of the things I remember before the breathing tube was placed was simply sitting by her side and telling her what was going to happen. And what we could and couldn't do to help,"" he remembers. ""She was scared about how little control she had or even the doctors had in how she did.""

Lorenzoni transferred her to an ICU, an operating room that had been converted. His shift was ending, and he signed out his other patients, but he stayed on to be with this one during the intubation.

""When her body didn't respond well to that, because it was so weak, I was there doing chest compressions on her,"" he says. ""And I signed her death certificate afterwards. It was a tough day.""

She was the first of his patients to die.

""Although she passed away without her family by her side, she wasn't alone,"" he says. ""I hope that even this small amount of company that she had at the end was comforting for her. And it's going to be one of the things that sticks with me for the rest of my career.""

Many of the people who have died from COVID-19 in New York had underlying health conditions, like diabetes and high blood pressure, and that's true in Lorenzoni's experience as well. But he says conditions that put someone at a higher risk are much more common than people realize.

""These are people that we know. These are people that we're related to,"" he says. ""It's either yourself, or your neighbor, or people that you work with.""

Hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have been decreasing for a few weeks now in New York, and Lorenzoni is back on pediatrics. It's a welcome relief for now, but he says if there's another surge, he could be called back.",1
529,529,650,Apple is giving $10 million to COVID-19 testing kit company,"Apple has announced that it’s giving $10 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to COPAN Diagnostics, a company that produces COVID-19 testing kits that are critical to monitor the spread of the novel coronavirus.

According to Apple’s announcement, the funding will help COPAN vastly scale up its production of testing kits, “expanding production from several thousand today to more than one million kits per week by early July.” Apple is also helping COPAN source and design new equipment for the company’s new facility in California.

“COPAN is one of the world’s most innovative manufacturers of sample collection kits for COVID-19 testing, and we’re thrilled to partner with them so they can expand as we work to address this critical issue for our nation,” commented Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, in a press release. “I couldn’t be prouder of our teams for bringing all of their energy, passion, and innovative spirit to supporting the country’s COVID-19 response.”

Apple’s latest efforts to contribute to the pandemic response

The funding joins Apple’s ongoing efforts to contribute to the global COVID-19 response. The company is also using its supply chain to source masks for health care workers, design and donate its own face shields, and develop a screening app and website with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most notably, there’s the company’s upcoming contact tracing system that it’s developing in a rare collaboration with Google to help track the spread of the virus.

Established in 2017, Apple’s Advanced Manufacturing Fund was a $1 billion fund — later expanded to $5 billion — that exclusively focuses on investing in domestic manufacturing and job creation in the United States. It’s a move that many have speculated was designed to help win favor with President Donald Trump who has long expressed a desire that Apple move more of its production work — including its iPhone manufacturing — to the US.

While the $10 million award to COPAN is a drop in the bucket compared to the $5 billion fund, it’s still notable since Apple tends to reserve that fund for Apple suppliers in the United States. Past major allocations have included the $450 million Apple awarded to Corning (which produces the Gorilla Glass found in iPhones), $390 million to Finisar (which makes lasers used to enable Face ID on iPhones and proximity features on AirPods), and $10 million to the Elysis aluminum partnership (which supplies carbon-free aluminum to Apple).",1
418,418,515,"With 65 new free testing sites added, Illinois has run nearly 100K coronavirus tests in past week","Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Thursday that 177 public sites are now offering free coronavirus testing across the state, with 65 new locations added since Pritzker reported last week that Illinois had reached the elusive goal of processing 10,000 tests in a single day.

Since hitting that mark last Friday, Illinois has run 96,551 total tests and hasn’t once dipped below that daily benchmark. The tests conducted over the past seven days account for more than 35% of the tests the state has conducted since reporting began in early March.

With his modified stay-at-home taking effect on Friday, Pritzker made it clear that testing for the deadly virus is “vital to our efforts to reduce social restrictions, get our economy going and to protect our residents.”

A drive-thru site at Norwegian American Hospital in Humboldt Park is among the new testing locations that have recently opened in minority communities that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Jose Sanchez, the hospital’s president and CEO, announced Thursday that over 80% of those tested since the site opened Tuesday have been Latino or African American.

Speaking to reporters at the governor’s daily press briefing, Sanchez said the new testing site helps “address the serious health inequities we have seen in our community.” The Sun-Times reported Thursday that the Latino community in Illinois has surpassed African Americans in confirmed cases of the coronavirus and could have the greatest number of patients among all races and ethnic groups within days.

“It is critical that we identify the individuals that have COVID-19 early so we can provide interventions and prevent the spread of virus in our underserved communities,” added Sanchez, who said the hospital is expected to run “hundreds” of COVID-19 tests by the end of the week.

In addition to the substantial increase in community testing sites like Norwegian, Pritzker announced that new drive-thru sites operated by the state will open next week in Waukegan and East St. Louis. Once those get up-and-running, Pritzker set a goal of collecting a total of 3,000 daily swabs at those seven sites.

As more tests have been processed, a lower rate have started to come back positive. Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike attributed that decrease to the state’s expanded criteria for testing, which had initially been limited to those considered at high risk of contracting the disease.

Casting a wider net is vital for getting a better sense of the true rate of infection. In South Korea, a country of 51 million that acted swiftly to institute an aggressive testing system, the positivity rate has hovered around 3%. Meanwhile, the rate of positive tests in Illinois has fallen to around 20%.

“We will have that lower positivity rate, but be grateful for the ones that we identify,” Ezike said.

While Pritzker said the state has taken considerable steps to address the shortage of supplies needed to run tests — including striking a deal with the White House to obtain hundreds of thousands of swabs and vials of the solution needed to transport them — he made it clear that the country “just doesn’t produce enough of these raw materials to meet the medical need.”

“Our procurement teams have been hard at work competing for those raw materials against every nation and every state in the open market,” Pritzker said. “And so far, we’re succeeding.”",1

Testing. What’s that all about? I understand they scrape inside your nose with a giant swab, then send the tip off to a lab to determine whether you’ve been infected by COVID-19.

But toward what end?

If you’re really sick, doctors need to know if it’s coronavirus to guide treatment. No confusion there. But what’s the goal of testing the general population? To track the pandemic’s spread? Important, but that isn’t why people are jamming National Guard drive-thru locations. Fear? Mere curiosity?

Opinion

The general idea, as best I understand it, is that you may have been infected but had no symptoms — many do not — and once you learn you were already infected but are OK now, then you can breathe a big sigh of relief and go about your business, packing into bars, jamming into church pews, secure in the knowledge you can’t get sick because you already have been.

You’d think that, desperate to get the economy back, both the dithering federal government and people protesting the lockdown would unite in one voice to demand those tests, now.

But they’re not. The federal government hems and haws like Hamlet, then shrugs and tells the states to figure it out — all while Fox News types cram statehouse steps to decry any organized attempt to save their lives as fascism.

Even municipalities are trying to get people tested, as are businesses like Simple Laboratories of Harwood Heights, a relatively new (founded 2014), relatively small (200 employees) diagnostic lab reaching over the paralyzed health care system, directly to the public, sorting out the general confusion as it goes.

“We’re in a world of questions right now,” said Narni Yoder, co-founder and chief sales officer of Simple Laboratories, which began drive-thru testing last week. “It’s not black and white.”

No kidding. Not long ago, Simple Labs was busy doing basic “tried and true” tests — scanning blood samples for venereal disease and hepatitis, diabetes and cancer. And then this plague came, and it began testing for that.

Diagnostic labs setting up white tents in church parking lots is a hint the medical system isn’t working.

“We couldn’t wait any longer,” said Yoder. “We tried to go through the normal channels of our clinics, doctors we work with independently. The majority are closed to patients. Everybody is funneled to emergency rooms. But those turn patients away and tell them to go to doctors. Our normal ways weren’t going to work; we had to find our own options. Three weeks ago, we realized: We can just do it. We need to figure it out.”

A lot of people need to do that. Yoder said her facility could process up to 4,000 tests a day but is doing only about 100.

“Our limitation is collection,” said Yoder, adding they’d like to work with groups, such as nursing homes.

No doubt. And I want to sell more papers. But why are tests important?

“People should know their status,” Yoder said. “People should be able to take care of themselves. If you don’t know, it causes more worry. When you know, you might have a path.”

That seemed awfully general. Most people, I imagine, have not been exposed to COVID-19, so testing does nothing besides put $100 into the pockets of places like Simple Laboratories while the tested person ends up in the exact same position: at home, wiping down cans of soup from Sunset Foods.

Right?

“A couple of ways to think about it,” she said. “One, without testing, we can’t move forward. How do we move everybody forward? We’ve been focusing on first responders. What about the rest of the community? What about everyone else? How do we move everything forward? ... That testing is critical.”

“It’s an important step forward,” said Arlene Jezierny, the mayor of Harwood Heights.

I’m all for moving forward. Yoder wouldn’t reveal what percentage of people they’ve tested had been exposed — trade secret — but I persisted. Most haven’t, right? Right?

“The majority of people were not exposed,” she allowed.

It’s all about moving forward.

“The faster we can test more folks, the more information we can contribute to the community and we’ll be able to bring everybody back to some sense of normalcy,” Yoder said.

What’s that line from the end of “The Sun Also Rises”? Oh yes. “Pretty to think so.”",1

190,190,259,Russia won’t tolerate USA’s move to appropriate the Moon and other celestial bodies,"Russia wonât let USA steal the Moon

Sergei Savelyev, deputy head for international cooperation of Russia's federal space agency Roscosmos, accused U.S. President Donald Trump of trying to expropriate resources of the Moon and other celestial bodies after the US president signed an executive order in support of commercial space exploration.

""Aggressive plans to seize territories of other planets can hardly encourage the countries to fruitful cooperation. History knows examples when one country decided to start seizing territories in its own interests, and everyone remembers what came out of it,"" Savelyev said.

On April 6, Donald Trump signed an executive order in support of the commercial development of resources on the Moon and other celestial bodies, instructing the US administration to object attempts to consider outer space as common property of mankind. The text of the document was distributed by the press service of the White House.

""Americans should have the right to engage in commercial exploration, extraction, and use of resources in outer space in accordance with applicable law. States are not party to the Moon Agreement. In addition, the United States does not consider the Moon Agreement to be an effective or necessary tool for the leadership of nation states regarding the promotion of commercial participation in the long-term exploration, scientific discovery and use of the Moon, Mars or other celestial bodies,"" the order reads.

According to the document, the State Department and other ministries and departments should conduct negotiations at the international level to conclude bilateral and multilateral agreements on the use, development and extraction of resources on the Moon and other celestial bodies by private and public companies. The Secretary of State must report on the work done within 180 days.



The document, in particular, says that the United States does not recognize the the Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (commonly known as the Moon Treaty), which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1979.

""The Secretary of State shall object to any attempt by any other state or international organization to treat the Moon Agreement as reflecting or otherwise expressing customary international law,"" Trump's executive order says.

According to the US administration, the order does not introduce any changes to US policy, but strengthens the current position and confirms the 2015, which allowed Americans and American companies to conduct commercial development and production of space resources, including water and minerals.

Americans won't fly anywhere

In the spring of 2019, the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) announced a new, three-stage lunar exploration program called Artemis. The first of them (Artemis 1) provides for an unmanned flight of the Orion spacecraft on board the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket around the Moon and its return to Earth. The mission is to take place in the second half of 2020.



The second stage (Artemis 2) - a crewed mission, including a Moon flyby - is scheduled for 2022. At the third stage of the mission (Artemis 3), NASA expects to land astronauts on the Moon in 2024 and send them to Mars approximately in the mid-2030s.



It is worthy of note that NASA suspended the assembly of all Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft due to the pandemic of the coronavirus infection.",0
280,280,360,Why We Don’t Know the True Death Rate for Covid-19,"
Coroners in some parts of the country are overwhelmed. Funeral homes in coronavirus hot spots can barely keep up. Newspaper obituary pages in hard-hit areas go on and on. Covid-19 is on track to kill far more people in the United States this year than the seasonal flu.
But determining just how deadly the new coronavirus will be is a key question facing epidemiologists, who expect resurgent waves of infection that could last into 2022.
As the virus spread across the world in late February and March, the projection circulated by infectious disease experts of how many infected people would die seemed plenty dire: around 1 percent, or 10 times the rate of a typical flu.
But according to various unofficial Covid-19 trackers that calculate the death rate by dividing total deaths by the number of known cases, about 6.4 percent of people infected with the virus have now died worldwide.
In Italy, the death rate stands at about 13 percent, and in the United States, around 4.3 percent, according to the latest figures on known cases and deaths. Even in South Korea, where widespread testing helped contain the outbreak, 2 percent of people who tested positive for the virus have died, recent data shows.
These supposed death rates also appear to vary widely by geography: Germany’s fatality rate appears to be roughly one-tenth of Italy’s, and Los Angeles’s about half of New York’s. Among U.S. states, Michigan, at around 7 percent, is at the high end, while Wyoming, which reported its first two deaths this week, has one of the lowest death rates, at about 0.7 percent.
Virology experts say there is no evidence that any strain of the virus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, has mutated to become more severe in some parts of the world than others, raising the question of why there appears to be so much variance from country to country.
Determining death rates is especially challenging in the midst of a pandemic, while figures are necessarily fluid. Fatality rates based on comparing deaths, which are relatively easy to count, to infections, which are not, almost certainly overestimate the true lethality of the virus, epidemiologists say. Health officials and epidemiologists have estimated there are five to 10 people with undetected infections for every confirmed case in some communities, and at least one estimate suggests there are far more.
On top of that, deaths lag infections. The thousands of people with Covid-19 who died this week in the United States were most likely infected as far back as a month ago. So as the number of new cases reported begins to fall in hard-hit places like New York City, the death rate will almost certainly rise.
“To know the fatality rate you need to know how many people are infected and how many people died from the disease,” said Ali H. Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. “We know how many people are dying, but we don’t know how many people are infected.”
In fact, even the number of people dying is a moving target. Covid-19 deaths that happen at home appear to be widely underreported. And New York City increased its death count by more than 3,700 on Tuesday, after officials said they were now including people who had never tested positive for the virus but were presumed to have died of it.
But the missing data on deaths in the deaths-to-infections ratio is still almost certain to be dwarfed by the expected increase in the denominator when the total number of infections is better understood, epidemiologists say. The statistic typically cited by mayors and governors at Covid-19 news conferences relies on a data set that includes mostly people whose symptoms were severe enough to be tested.
Epidemiologists call it “severity bias.” It is why the fatality rate in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began, was reported to be between 2 percent and 3.4 percent before it was revised to 1.4 percent, and it may yet be lower.
One intriguing case study for epidemiologists looking for the true fatality rate is the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which became a kind of natural experiment when nearly all of its 3,711 passengers and crew members were tested for the coronavirus after an outbreak on board.
The ship’s “case fatality rate,” which included only those who showed symptoms, was 2.6 percent, according to a study by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, while the “infection fatality rate,” which included those who tested positive yet remained asymptomatic, was 1.3 percent. (A cruise ship, in which people are in a confined space, is not representative of the more dynamic situation in cities). The known number of coronavirus cases worldwide is about two million, and at least 127,000 of those patients have died. The United States has an estimated 600,000 reported cases and more than 25,000 deaths, the most in the world. But many people infected with the virus have no symptoms, or only mild ones, and appear in no official tally.
Facing a shortage of tests to confirm who has the disease and who does not, and fearing a shortage of I.C.U. beds, hospitals in some areas of the United States have declined to test or admit people whose oxygen saturation is above 90 percent.
Whether a particular locale tests people with even mild symptoms is a key factor in determining how many people were infected, but testing capacity has been limited in many places.
“People with mild symptoms, I just send them home,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and a critical care physician in Pittsburgh. “All of this is creating disparities in case-fatality ratios that don’t reflect real differences.”
Even with testing now becoming more widely available for Americans with Covid-19 symptoms, the proportion of people infected by the virus who do not feel appreciably sick is unknown, including in places with some of the highest deaths per 100,000 people: New York (55), Spain (40), Belgium (36), Italy (35), New Jersey (32), France (23) and Louisiana (22).
A clue comes from Iceland, which has tested 6 percent of its population, perhaps the highest proportion of any country. Of those who tested positive, 43 percent had no symptoms at the time, though it is likely that many developed them later.
What scientists call the infection fatality rate is so closely watched because even a seemingly trivial decrease — from, say, 1.0 percent to 0.9 percent — could mean a few hundred thousand fewer deaths in a population the size of the United States. It is also used to calibrate interventions aimed at preventing more deaths with their grim economic consequences.
Over the coming months, tests that can identify antibodies in the blood of people who were unwittingly exposed to the virus will allow for a closer approximation of total infections in different populations.
Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health recently announced that they would begin using antibody tests to see what proportion of the U.S. population has already been infected. Covid-19 may prove to be less lethal than initial predictions, with an infection fatality rate of under 1 percent, as suggested in an editorial published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and Dr. H. Clifford Lane, both of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the C.D.C.
But the public should not take a false comfort in death-rate statistics that might suddenly seem lower, epidemiologists warn.
The infection fatality rate of seasonal flu strains, which kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, is about 0.1 percent. And as Dr. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official, told lawmakers in March when he was urging them to take serious mitigation efforts, the coronavirus “is a really serious problem.”
The inconsistencies in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in different parts of the United States, according to a C.D.C. report released this week, depend on numerous factors: when the first cases of the virus arrived in a region; its population density; and the age distribution and prevalence of underlying medical conditions in its population. Also important are the timing and extent of community mitigation measures introduced by a region’s public officials, its diagnostic testing capacity and its public-health reporting practices.
The same factors most likely apply to the jumble of outcomes across the globe. But which ones end up fueling or mitigating a local outbreak, infectious disease experts say, can be hard to tease out.
The disparity between New York, with 55 deaths per 100,000 people, and California, with two, for instance, has been widely attributed to the imposition of earlier stay-at-home orders in California, which already had a work-at-home culture prepared to embrace the restrictions. But what about New York’s role as the business capital of the world, where travelers returning from Europe unwittingly introduced the coronavirus by mid-February? Or its high population density, which the C.D.C. report suggests may significantly accelerate the transmission of a disease spread by droplets of mucus or saliva?
“The comparison of New York to California is a little unfair in a way,” said Dr. Mokdad of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. “Yes, in California, the governor put in the shutdown order faster, we shouldn’t take that away from them. But the deck of cards are stacked more against New York.”
Italy’s large number of cases, which overwhelmed its health care system, may be linked to its having the second-oldest population in the world after Japan; likewise The New York Times has identified more than 7,000 deaths at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities across the United States with coronavirus cases.
And the alarming number of African-Americans across many states being killed by Covid-19, health experts said, is likely to be related to higher rates of health conditions, rooted in longstanding economic and health care inequalities, that make it harder for them to survive the infection.
“The state number is an average that masks disparities by county, or even within a county,” Dr. Mokdad said. “Covid-19 is coming on top of underlying population diversity and disparities in health in the United States, and many communities will suffer from it more than other communities.”
Even as parts of the country edge toward reopening, cases are rising in Florida and other Southern states whose governors delayed closing beaches and dine-in restaurants. And it is the virus’s transmission rate, as much as its infection fatality rate, that is preoccupying public health experts trying to find a way forward.
“Everyone in the whole country is vulnerable to this,” said Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine. “Nobody has pre-immunity. That’s totally unlike flu. So New York had some early cases, it spread like crazy. But why is Des Moines not going to have a Covid epidemic? What’s so special about Springfield, Ill.? Social distancing will end. And people will start getting it again and dying.”",1
1060,1060,1256,I'm grieving ceremonies lost to coronavirus as my son marks a milestone a continent away,"Meg Waite Clayton

Opinion contributor

My son defended his doctoral dissertation virtually this spring, from an apartment where he lives alone, 3,123 miles away from me. In normal times, one of his mentors would have brought a bottle of good champagne to toast the newly-minted Professor Clayton. In normal times, I’d have a ticket for a seat beside his 87-year-old grandfather on a six-hour flight to applaud the short moment of Chris walking across a stage in crimson silk gown and black-and-crimson hood, with the white crow's-feet emblem of an arts and sciences guy, an economist.

Instead, we’re looking for an alternative way to honor six years of incredibly hard work. I’m caught without the eggs and chocolate even to make his favorite flourless chocolate cake. I’m seeking advice by tweet about what that shop where he buys Thanksgiving pies might be, and whether they could deliver to his door in time for the box to be quarantined, or whether disinfecting it with bleach spray is good enough.

We've lost our traditions

Ceremony. Merriam Webster defines it as “a formal act or series of acts prescribed by ritual, protocol, or convention.” But what do you do when a pandemic makes ritual, protocol, and convention impossible? “Celebrate” is “to perform (a sacrament or solemn ceremony) publicly and with appropriate rites.” Publicly.

It feels indulgent, to grieve such a small loss. My family remains alive and uninfected. We are not saying that last goodbye by phone to a loved one dying in a hospital room without our hand to hold. We are not postponing that ultimate of ceremonies, the funeral. We are not having to bear that ultimate of griefs alone.

The loss of ceremony is not even the hardest thing my son has had to endure in his relatively short life. Not even close. And he starts his dream job at a university July 1. He won’t even suffer a health insurance gap.

And yet I cry in the shower, as do, I suppose, millions of us all over the world. We grieve the chance to celebrate those we love in what used to be the big moments in life, in the time before every moment of life itself seemed so very big. Moments that, all over the world, and for all of human history, have been marked by ceremony.

Pandemic life:We're slouching toward graduation at home with our college senior

No flipping of tassels or tossing of graduation caps this May and June. Not for college students or law students or Ph.D.s. Not for high schools. Not for middle schools or preschools. Not for medical students, many of whom are already out working in the fight to defeat this virus. Even the U.S. Naval Academy, where the hat-tossing tradition began in 1912, tossed theirs this year without the benefit of an audience to applaud.

No dancing at weddings or comic stuffing of cake bites into newlywed mouths. No babies crying over baptismal fonts. No awkward student welcomes and get-to-know-yous over the summer. Birthdays. Anniversaries. Publication parties. Film premieres. Retirements. Not even a Mother’s Day brunch for most of us.

Easter teleconference to meet a baby

This spring, there will be none of those moments we photograph and paste into scrap books, share with our virtual friends, and set out in frames for years to come.

So we adapt, of course. My niece introduces her new daughter into the family by Easter teleconference. My nephew considers delaying a fall wedding until we can all gather again. Zoom becomes a verb with a new meaning, and we have never been so grateful to be living in the time of video technology that was the stuff of television-show fiction when many of us were growing up.

HOTLINE:Share your coronavirus story

My son, like so many graduates this year, will attend a virtual commencement and a “special online event” for some smaller group of Ph.D. candidates or economists, the details of which are being worked out now.

He will also be feted in person “sometime later, once we know it is safe to bring people together again,” his university president assures us. That celebration will come with “all of the pomp, circumstance, and tradition that is typical” of their commencements, and “as many of the traditional campus festivities that typically precede commencement as possible.”

We need a Coronavirus Service Corps:It will help America and our vulnerable young people

We will be there whenever we can be, and we will applaud all the more enthusiastically for having endured this moment and come out on the other side. We hope we will, anyway. We are staying indoors, and living without eggs if they can’t be delivered to us, and recognizing the privilege we have to be able to stay inside, stay well, and endure only these small griefs.

And, yes, we cry in the shower. But we also appreciate these pivotal life moments even more somehow, for having to experience them virtually, or to look forward to the time when “celebrate” is once again a present-tense verb.

976,976,1169,My great-grandfather’s letters from Camp Funston show the origins of the 1918 flu pandemic in real time.,"Camp Funston. U.S. Army/Wikipedia/Public Domain

My first hot flash hit inside the San Fernando Cathedral in San Antonio, where I’d traveled from Wisconsin to see the crypt of Davy Crockett. There was a baptism there that day, and a white-gowned baby howled when the priest cupped holy water over its head. I was jealous and wanted cool water splashed on me. My next feverish wave shoved me outside, to a pharmacy down the street, where a cheap thermometer told me I was running a tick high. The next four hours, wandering among the Alamo ghosts, mostly remain a blur.

These were my first symptoms, I think. It’s impossible to claw through the fog of a weekslong illness and pinpoint its initial strike. I could have caught it the next day when an airport employee coughed on my arm. I rushed to the bathroom, stripped my shirt, and furiously scrubbed my limbs up to the elbow. Two sinks over, a guy in a slick golf shirt sneered. I don’t usually bathe here, I wanted to tell him. A fit of hypochondria.

The following week, fleeting spells came and went, chills, a sweaty forehead, low-grade fever, odd body aches, weird, single-burst coughs.

My great-grandparents’ letters detail the origin of the 1918 flu pandemic in real time . Jeff Snowbarger

Hutchinson, Kansas

July 1918

Families, friends, and lovers packed the depot platform. They’d flocked in autos, surreys, and buckboard wagons to bid their boys farewell. With winter wheat harvest complete, the young men were off to war. No one knew how long the upheaval would last. Under a merciless Kansas sun, the press of bodies gripped Edward so tightly he nearly lost his suitcase. Mary squeezed at his side, but there wasn’t enough wiggle room for Edward to wrap his free arm around her. Despite their monthlong engagement, the lovers did not kiss goodbye.

The letters he wrote to the woman he was courting, my great-grandmother, detail the origins of the pandemic in real time.

Edward and Mary were my great-grandparents. Edward was 24, Mary 22. Both had been reared in devout homes steeped in Scripture and song. Their lives revolved on an axis of hard work and holiness revival. To them, chores and prayer were equal acts of worship. After he arrived at Camp Funston, the barrack boys couldn’t believe Edward had never kissed a girl. According to Mary, the nosy soldiers’ “indulgences were disgusting.”

During their three-year courtship, the pair exchanged hundreds of letters, which my grandfather saved in a beat-up steamer trunk that serves as our family archives. Edward lived on a farm 30 miles west of Hutchinson, while Mary’s folks bounced around town and finally settled in an orchard house on the outskirts of the small prairie city. Even through the days when they regularly met in person, their correspondence rarely stalled longer than a few days. Like the prairie that raised them, their penmanship was free of flourish, elegant in its plainness. Naïveté leaps off the page. Both were smitten—by each other, by God. As Mary wrote in June of 1918:

I wonder what you are doing this hot afternoon. I don’t see how you could endure it out in the field. … I picked cherries for three hours this morning, also picked a gallon of June berries before dinner. … I’m glad that Jesus can keep us even in hot weather.

At the depot that July, they had no clue what lay in store. No one forecast the long black cloud bearing down.

Six days after the baptism, a spasm gripped my chest, a brief lung squeeze familiar to asthmatics. I puffed my emergency inhaler and soon felt fine. For several days, the spasms returned, growing in frequency and punch. By now the nation was at war—the coronavirus had shut local schools, canceled March Madness, and begun overwhelming hospital beds. I wondered if my symptoms were simply manifestations of stress, the way our bodies sponge anxiety, uncertainty, until it dwells urchinlike inside us. Had the global panic attack hit me? Twelve days after the baptism, huffing, heart pounding, dizzy, I drove to the ER not knowing if or when I’d see my wife and kids again.

Camp Funston anchored a bend at the head of “the Kaw,” or Kansas River. Just west of camp, the Smoky Hill and Republican rivers joined to form the muddy flow that skirted Funston’s grid of long, rectangular barracks, chow halls, hospitals, parade grounds, quartermaster stations, classrooms, libraries, and company headquarters. Treeless hills nested the encampment, grassy oblong mounds of layered limestone and chert, otherwise known as the Flint Hills, the most dramatic topographical ripple splitting Kansas.

During the American mobilization for World War I, Camp Funston served as one of 16 Army training posts scattered across the nation. Here, the U.S. Army drilled enlisted and conscripted men, boys mostly, in marksmanship, tent pitching, and “practical bayonet combat.” On the flyleaf of his Infantry Drill Regulations manual, Edward wrote:

My General Orders are: I. To take charge of this post and all gov’t property in view. II. To walk my post in a military manner, keeping always on the alert and observing everything …

My great-grandfather. Jeff Snowbarger

At any given time, 30,000 to 50,000 people swarmed the military grounds. For every dinner shift, an ocean of coffee was boiled, a range of cattle consumed, a mountain of potatoes peeled. Sleeping halls held 150 beds so entire companies could bunk together. The claustrophobic quarters readied soldiers’ minds to be sardined into boxcars, transport holds, and, eventually, trenches gouged in foreign soil. Most Midwestern boys had never experienced this unnatural density of humanity.

When my great-grandfather arrived, Camp Funston had already proved to be a breeding ground for disease. The early months of 1918 saw local outbreaks of smallpox, spinal meningitis, measles, “lump jaw” or mumps, scarlet fever, diphtheria, tuberculosis, typhoid, and cholera, not to mention the mostly unmentioned venereal or “social diseases,” which camp officers blamed on the “influences” of “immoral and diseased women” from Kansas City and Topeka. As an adherent to the tenets of Christian holiness, Edward avoided this final plague. The exuberant script on his discharge letter deemed his character Excellent. God was Edward’s only true lover. Twenty-four and kissless, a green enlistee in worldly war, he believed as it reads in Corinthians: “Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.”* Shortly after his welcome to Funston, Edward discovered God was not the only invisible presence to fear.

My nurse and doctor wore disposable smocks and gloves, face masks taped to their cheeks, and plastic shields like riot police. My oxygen levels were good; blood pressure high; 20 breaths a minute, also high. My flu test came back negative; chest x-rays looked clean. Diagnosis: upper respiratory infection with cough. The nurse who administered the COVID test warned it wouldn’t be pleasant—the nasal swab felt like a sapling being screwed into my brain. Labs are swamped, she said. Results won’t arrive for a week or more.

I was told to rest and hydrate; acetaminophen should help the aches; take your inhaler as needed; and come back immediately if your symptoms worsen. That night, back home, my fever spiked. My chest felt tighter than ever and waves of fever froze then broiled my bones. I quarantined myself in a side bedroom and woke the next morning tangled in wet sheets. The 10 steps to the bathroom were a woozy mountain climb.

Mid-August, Mary wrote:

Think I hear someone in Mr. Coleman’s melon patch. … Glad you are getting acquainted with some real Christians with whom you can associate. … I am so thankful to Jesus and all he means to my unworthy heart. … [T]he Eds’ brought their “Edison Phonograph” out here Sunday.

Simplicities filled Mary’s days: washing, milking, Papa’s threshing and apple picking, neighbor visits, piano lessons, prayer meetings, Scripture study, helping “the girls read Caesar.” Her letters plainly convey life did not halt once her fiancé stomped off to war.

Papa feels somewhat encouraged by his apples. I must get the cow in and milk. So will have to close. Our prayers are with you boys and we just want God to have His way.

Her dispatches to Edward read as if their casual conversations never paused, as if their faith in God and each other was sufficient to make her unseen, unreachable lover feel a sofa pillow away. “I don’t suppose you were very hungry for sausage by the time you had ground such a large amount. Were you?” More seasoned at culling heifers, tilling with draft teams, and sawing stovewood, Edward struggled through camp kitchen duty, and Mary relished small moments where experience gave her the upper hand.

By late September, another seeming triviality visits her page: “[M]amma read in the paper that it was a false alarm and that there wasn’t any Influenza in the state. So my hopes rose again.” She was responding to Edward’s news that Camp Funston was being quarantined and would impede her desire to travel his way and spend an afternoon picnicking, swapping dreams, parting in prayer.

This wasn’t Funston’s first medical lockdown of the year. Partial and individual quarantines and had been issued for spinal meningitis, smallpox, scarlet fever, German measles, influenza, and pneumonia. Quarantine restrictions limited travel on and off base and closed the camp to outside visitors. Night guards, posted on every street in camp, operated under strict orders to report any sign of sickness. Medical officers isolated symptomatic individuals, often ordering men to report to one of two canvas-roofed field hospitals erected a safe distance from the main hive of operation. Separate convalescent camps were built to house men who’d simply come in contact with a confirmed case of scarlet fever or measles. Other outbreaks forced command to sequester entire barracks to prevent disease from ravaging the wider camp.

Most soldiers took the separation measures in stride. Meningitis, scarlet fever, and measles were equally miserable to endure as they were communicable. Many relished the downtime, as quarantine offered a respite from hard labor for the first time in their lives. Others felt the ward walls pressing in: The snake squeeze of confinement made them itch, the un-American stricture of movement. Paranoia drove a handful insane.

“Much Ado About Nothing,” a nearby newspaper explained to its readers. “That’s what some people call all the care in vaccination and establishing quarantine and fumigating, but it is better to have the ‘much ado’ and ‘nothing’ serious as a result than to have no ado and death after death, as we did before they vaccinated, quarantined or fumigated.”

Americans of that era were so much closer to death and disease it seems unimaginable to us now. Everyone knew someone killed or maimed by illness. The average life expectancy was 50. A third of all U.S. deaths occurred in children below the age of 5. Mary had lost two younger sisters in a span of two years, one of whom passed a mere 36 hours after her first sniffle arose. Death came so quickly that the family didn’t know which ailment to blame. But it wasn’t just disease that shaped social consciousness—everyday life was lethal. When Edward was young, a wagon full of corn rolled over his head. The wheel crushed his skull into the sandy road, lacerating his scalp above the ear. The resulting scar traversed half the equator of his head. As a baby, he snagged his bonnet on a barbed wire fence. His mother found him hanging, kicking his feet, his asphyxiated face dulled blue. Scarlet fever struck Edward’s little sister blind. Elsie, not yet 2, was quarantined in a room with her mother. The last thing she ever saw was her father kneeling at the door, rolling her an apple across the floor.

The county Health Department called to notify us that our house had been placed under a 14-day quarantine. No one in; no one out. We were fine on supplies, I assured them. My wife having spent the first week of the crisis squirreling away flour, pasta, rice, etc., and purchasing a quarter of freezer beef. My only contribution to our future survival was our dwindling firewood supply, a decade’s worth of .22 ammunition, and a cooler full of on-sale corned beef my wife had begged me not to buy.

Luckily, the illness never stole my hunger. But the dehydration was extreme. Over the next six days, the height of my struggle, I guzzled three gallons of electrolyte water a day and still my cells seemed parched. My body quaked like it was being chewed apart from the inside, at the microscopic level. Bolts of energy I’d never experienced—strange zips I attributed to my immune system straining its gears—sliced through my veins. I could feel my whole body engaged in the throes of survival.

In early March of 1918, a company cook, Albert Gitchell, reported to camp feverish and short of breath. He would go down as the first victim of a peculiar influenza strain that, over the course of several weeks, swept Camp Funston. The short-lived but virulent epidemic resulted in 2,480 reported cases and hospitalized more than 1,000 men. Upon their arrival, soldiers had received numerous inoculations, all of which proved powerless against this particular strain. Newspapers called it simply a spat of “Lagrippe.” By mid-April most signs of flu decamped, save the 400 convalescents still wracked by coughs and the bodies of 46 men the epidemic struck dead. As spring rolled on, troops shipped out, and few paid attention to the potential consequences of their diaspora. Only a small group of doctors raised the alarm after exhuming unusually limp, soggy lungs while conducting postmortem exams.

A letter my great-grandmother wrote to my great-grandfather in 1918. Jeff Snowbarger

Though things had cooled at Funston, the strain, having stowed away in reassigned soldiers’ lungs, almost immediately began to boil up in Army camps nationwide. The speed with which it spread was breathtaking. Deploying from American posts, transit ships conveying fresh meat to the Western Front were hijacked by the virus, and once in Europe, the flu quickly raked the allied trenches and plagued civilian populations throughout Italy, England, France, and Spain. Wherever American soldiers beached, the virus went on a tear. By May of 1918, nearly three-fourths of the French army had succumbed to fevers, shivers, and aches. To everyone’s relief, summer saw case numbers drop, and by August, hopes flared that the pathogen was running out of steam.

Somewhere along the way, however, somewhere in the water-logged trenches, a humid field hospital, or a damp cathedral hastily converted to receive front-line casualties, a microscopic change occurred that spurred this influenza outbreak to become the most voracious plague since the bubonic days. Scientists believe, as it leapt from lung to lung, the virus morphed to work more synergistically with several strains of pneumonia-inducing bacteria. Once the influenza yoked its strength to secondary bacterial infections, the pathogen matured into an indiscriminate pestilence that mowed down young and old, rich and poor, sick and healthy alike. It was one thing to die in battle, for honor, glory, naïve excitement; it’s another, far more incomprehensible thing to go from a state of vim and vigor to drowning in your own juices in the span of a single day.

This was the influenza strain that returned to America in the late summer or early fall of 1918. Its circumnavigation had allowed the disease to shake its origins, which is why we don’t refer to the 1918 pandemic as the Kansas flu, as perhaps we should.

CALL IT “SPREE-ENZA” OR PLAIN SPANISH FLU: exclaimed a Topeka headline.

New Kind of Grip—You Swim on a Sea of Sickness—Want to Die and Can’t—It’s Some Ailment.

On Sept. 30, the flu first arrived in Mary and Edward’s letters, only as a “false alarm.” But soon, the outbreak was on everybody’s mind. On Oct. 2, a local doctor instructed readers of the Hutchinson Gazette:

It is easy to tell when one has this disease, because it is much more severe than even a very bad cold, and is accompanied by backache, headache—in fact aches all over. It may come on very suddenly, with bodily weakness, and the victim’s one best bet is to jump into bed and send for the doctor.

The next day, news broke: “The worst has come! Influenza, or ‘Spanish fleas’ as it is facetiously known to those who have not fallen into its clutches, descended yesterday upon three victims in Hutchinson … but there’s no system in going to bed, scared to death, the minute you begin to sneeze.” Clearly, a wickedly sick chicken had come home to roost, but at the time it was easy to joke about a “foreign” pestilence so few civilians had experienced firsthand.

Rural life had plenty of other worries. Some prairie folks still lived in dugouts, literal burrows in the earth. Mary’s letters mention family friends starting a new Colorado farm this way. Other settlers still lived in “soddies,” primitive rooms made of stacked prairie sod. Poor folk commonly shared roofs with gophers, pack rats, dogs, cats, chickens, goats, milch cows, rattlesnakes, and hogs. These pan-animal dwellings and the everyday closeness of human and animal life created ideal environments for pathogens to leap the species boundary, which is precisely how some experts believe the 1918 pandemic began. One Kansas family shared their dugout with a brood of burrowing owls that returned each May to rear new young in the same corner where the family kept their willow bassinet.

Six whole days my lungs felt limp, incapable of filling with air. My diaphragm seemed to seize like a blown piston. The underside of my sternum ached. The pressure was a bear that rode my chest. Since I was 10, whenever a similar breathlessness took hold, I could always suck my inhaler and achieve relief. Such spells never came more than a dozen times a year. But in the days following my ER stint, I found myself utterly dependent on my inhaler. Two puffs every four hours. Morning to midnight. No inhaler, no breathing. In the hours between, I had to think deep breaths into my lungs, mentally force inhalations past my bronchial forks and into the sore chambers starved for air. I kept my cellphone charged and a bag of clothes by the door.

On Oct. 4, Mary wrote to Edward explaining that she’d exhausted herself helping her father pick apples. She believed she’d worked herself sick. “It’s laughable to me now. … I don’t think I need any pity at all because I know it was my own fault.” Although the flu was nigh, Mary’s disposition remained hopeful. “I don’t mean to seem ungrateful to God for my health and I intend to be more careful. I sure want to live a useful life for Him. And even tho’ I see so much to do, around me I know God will give me the strength to do and He will never require more of me than I can do. I do realize that these are days when there is a plenty for everybody to do.”

What Mary didn’t yet realize was Edward had also fallen ill. In a previous letter, he’d broken the news he was “going to the trenches,” but this information did not affect Mary half as much as news that flu had sacked her fiancé. “I certainly think it was very considerate of you in not telling me you were in Hospital,” she wrote on Oct. 9:

Altho’ I have wondered many times how you are. And have prayed the Lord to be a wall of fire about you and shield you from the ravages of disease. And I’m sure “He has given His angels charge over thee.” I’m glad to know you has such a light case of it.

Her lover escaped the worst. After a week in the camp infirmary, Edward was released, but, for Mary, the reality of the influenza outbreak finally hit home:

Of course in reading so much about it in the papers, I couldn’t help but wonder if you would escape it. And at the same time I knew that you would be careful and also that you would be better able to throw off disease than if you were more “run down.” There are three cases of Influenza here in town and I’m not positive about it but heard that the schools are to close temporarily.

Mary’s gossip mill proved correct. That day’s Hutchinson Gazette reported: “Schools, Movies and Churches Closed by ‘Flu.’ ” In less than a week, rumors of a local outbreak had swelled into a public health crisis. Daily life changed overnight—“Alarming spread of epidemic causes drastic order by Health Board.” Not only were the main social hubs shuttered, authorities forbade public meetings “where more than 15 people may gather. … It was the only thing to do under the circumstances.” The following day, Hutchinson reported 28 new cases. Mary never complained about the church closures. She’d already experienced too much loss to believe God would heal and protect everyone she loved. Humbly, she understood that death sometimes usurps small liberties.

In a matter of months, the young couple discusses 25 sick mutual friends, five of whom end up dead.

The war still commanded headlines; influenza coverage often didn’t start until Page 3. But by now, the nation understood a new front in a different war had opened. Newspapers tallied mortality rates that proved two and three times higher than normal flus. “Even at the present stage,” a syndicate proclaimed, “it ranks as one of the worst plagues that has ever afflicted the country.” To keep the flu at bay, municipalities leveled severe restrictions. In New York City, “Sneezers and Coughers who fail to use handkerchiefs when the explosions occur in public are to be subject to $500 fine or a year in prison.” Entire towns blockaded themselves to keep out carriers. Condemned houses were torn down to build caskets from floor planks and siding, and before the ground froze, men dug mass graves. Cloth masks were everywhere. Quarantined homes set warning signs in windows. Even amid the nation’s massive plains, responses to the invisible vector caught everyone’s eye. As Mary noted, “We saw a number of Influenza cards as we were in town yesterday.”

Visibility, understandably, drove paranoia: “From what I read in the paper, I guess I had some of the symptoms of it,” Mary wrote, “but it was what I’d call a cold in my head. I had a start of it Wed. when I was writing to you and have been feeling rather ‘bum’ since then. Not bad enough that I couldn’t work but I have had to sneeze quite a lot and that just made me feel miserable.” Every sniffle, twitch, and ache became suspect. Every body was a source of fear.

Meanwhile, the flu continued to decimate Camp Funston. According to the Army Medical Department, September had seen 3,534 reported cases; in October, that number jumped to 11,290. The tide overwhelmed camp hospitals, relief organizations built temporary infirmaries, and the Army converted barracks to house battalions of sickened men. In all, Funston dedicated 22 buildings to the fight. The sudden strain on resources became so severe that healthy infantrymen, trained to join the trenches at a moment’s notice, filled in as nurses, sponging bodies, emptying bedpans, reading the bedridden magazines and mail, transcribing last desires and wills. Once recovered, Edward accepted “nurse duty,” knowing nothing of medicine but what he’d learned on the farm delivering foals and calves.

By late October, Hutchinson claimed hundreds of sick citizens. Mary expressed her dismay, writing, “It has really seemed rather alarming here because there were so many cases.” As often happened in her letters, alarm softened to existential contemplation: “How much these things ought to help us realize that life is very uncertain.” Eventually, the epidemic infected her letters as much as her habitual nods toward God. Responding to news that Edward kept busy attending military funerals, she pleaded, “May God continue to keep you in the hollow of His almighty hand.”

Others discovered the solace of quack remedies. One Hutchinson man touted the palliative magic of a particular “nasal douche and throat gargle.” The recipe, from a “celebrated New York physician, a specialist in disorders of the nasal tract,” consisted of “1 and ½ grains permanganate of potash, 90 grains chloride sodium (common salt).” The powder could then be divided into 20 doses, separately dissolved in hot water to create a pinkish pint that one could squirt up their nose. Another popular cure was an “Old Welsh Remedy” that included hot foot baths, opium, garlic, alcohol, and ice. Health officials regularly warned that “squirrel whisky was no cure for flu.”

“O, how wonderful it is,” Edward responded to Mary, “to be submissive to Jesus and trust him when all seems dark and unpromising.” Their letters don’t fully convey the pandemic’s brutality until names begin to appear—Ray Lange, Elmer King, Roger Winan’s wife, Brother Mendell, Mrs. Dunham and her family, Mrs. Mickey, and the Spurgeon family—“surely lots of folks needing help.” In a matter of months, the young couple discusses 25 sick mutual friends, five of whom end up dead. On visiting Mrs. Mendell after her husband passed, Mary wished she could have helped her with the wash, “But she said she was really better off when she was busy at something like that. She said she is so nervous and walks the floor and cries and grieves so much that she can see it is telling on her physically. So for that reason no doubt she needs something to occupy her mind and hands too.”

By January, Edward and Mary had experienced sufferings large and small, witnessed sickness and death on a scale that would have been unthinkable when they bid farewell on the train platform six short months before. Once the kaiser abdicated, and ink on the armistice dried, worry over Edward’s deployment shifted to the hope of discharge and the anticipation of coming home. After all, the couple had a wedding to plan.

Among all the letters they swapped, a January line lifts off the page. On hearing Edward’s discharge might still be months away, Mary wrote, “I want you to know that I am feeling fine.” It’s a subtle expression, a throwaway line, that without a sense of its darker context would read as trite filler. But surviving the fall of 1918 was a nearly providential feat. Amid an episode of wanton loss and private tribulation, relaying to a loved one that you are “feeling fine” is perhaps the truest, most honest way to gift another soul a boost of hope in the face of a shared, uncertain future.

Nearly two and a half months after I walked out of the San Fernando Cathedral, full breaths are still difficult to come by. Overall, I feel recovered. That is until my body reminds me I’m not and forces me to stop working, stop walking, stop reading, set the chainsaw aside, sit down, rest, now. While I can’t yet say that I feel fine, I can thankfully, gracefully say I am alive.",1

926,926,1100,Senate Democrats introduce bill to boost nonprofit workforce as coronavirus crushes resources,"Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) speaks during a campaign rally at the Altria Theatre on February 29, 2020 in Richmond, Virginia.

A group of Senate Democrats introduced legislation Friday to provide grants to nonprofits to bolster hiring efforts as their resources dwindle amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The bill, introduced by Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, is meant to equip nonprofits with a strong workforce that can continue to provide essential services to vulnerable Americans.

Nonprofits will be able to apply directly for the grants through the Treasury Department, according to a press release from Klobuchar's office announcing the bill, which is called WORK NOW, or the Work Opportunities and Resources to Keep Nonprofit Organizations Well Act. The hope is the grants will allow nonprofits to retain their workforce or provide jobs for newly unemployed people.

Since government lockdowns began, nonprofits and institutions catering to vulnerable populations like domestic violence shelters, homeless shelters and food banks, have seen steep declines in volunteers and revenue. At the same time, these nonprofits are trying to adhere to social distancing guidelines as they grapple with ways to stay afloat.

In some cases, volunteer shortages have led to higher expenses to maintain the same levels of service.

About 72.5% of nonprofits surveyed said they've seen reduced contributions since the pandemic hit, according to a report released Thursday. The survey, conducted by the Charities Aid Foundation of America, asked about 880 nonprofits around the world to weigh in on how the coronavirus has affected them.

""Nonprofits are on the front lines of this crisis helping millions of Americans in need. From food banks, to shelters, to counseling centers, charitable organizations are doing incredible work to help families put food on their table, provide housing assistance, and serve people with disabilities,"" Klobuchar said in the release.

""But as demand for their services soars, many of these organizations are struggling financially. At the same time, over 36 million men and women have lost their jobs and are looking for work. We need to help charitable nonprofits keep their doors open, scale their invaluable services, and provide opportunities for unemployed men and women to return to work serving their communities.""

The WORK NOW Act is sponsored by Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons of Delaware, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.

The outbreak has spread to dozens of countries globally, with more than 4.4 million confirmed cases worldwide and over 302,493 deaths so far, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There are at least 1.4 million cases in the United States and at least 85,906 deaths, according to the latest tallies.",1
653,653,793,"Dems’ $3T new virus bill boosts state aid, essential workers","WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled a more than $3 trillion coronavirus aid package Tuesday, providing nearly $1 trillion for states and cities, “hazard pay” for essential workers and a new round of cash payments to individuals.

The House is expected to vote on the package as soon as Friday, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said there is no “urgency.” The Senate will wait until after Memorial Day to act.

The so-called Heroes Act is built around nearly $1 trillion for states, cities and tribal governments to avert layoffs, focused chiefly on $375 billion for smaller suburban and rural municipalities largely left out of earlier rounds of aid.

It will offer a fresh round of $1,200 direct cash aid to individuals, increased to up to $6,000 per household, and launches a $175 billion housing assistance fund to help pay rents and mortgages. There is $75 billion more for virus testing.

It would continue, through January, the $600-per-week boost to unemployment benefits. It adds a 15% increase for food stamps and new help for paying employer-backed health coverage. For businesses, there’s an employee retention tax credit.

There’s $200 billion in “hazard pay” for essential workers on the front lines of the crisis.

Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the bill “will be ready” to call lawmakers back to Washington for the vote.

But the 1,800-page package is heading straight into a Senate roadblock. Senate Republicans are not planning to vote on any new relief until June, after a Memorial Day recess.

President Donald Trump has already signed into law nearly $3 trillion in aid approved by Congress.

The new package extends some provisions from previous aid packages, and adds new ones.

There are other new resources, including $25 billion for the U.S. Postal Service. There is help for the 2020 Census and the November election. The bill also provides $3.6 billion to help local officials prepare for the challenges of holding elections during the pandemic.

The popular Payroll Protection Program, which has been boosted in past bills, would see another $10 billion to ensure under-served businesses and nonprofit organizations have access to grants through a disaster loan program.

For hospitals and other health care providers, there’s another $100 billion infusion to help cover costs and additional help for hospitals serving low-income communities.

There’s another $600 million in funding to tackle the issue of rapid spread of the virus in state and federal prisons, along with $600 million in help to local police departments for salaries and equipment

As states weigh the health risks of re-opening, McConnell said the nation needs to “regroup and find a more sustainable middle ground between total lockdown and total normalcy.”

The Republican leader on Tuesday called the emerging Democratic bill a “big laundry list of pet priorities.”

“To those who would suggest a pause, I would say the hunger doesn’t take a pause, the rent doesn’t take a pause,” Pelosi said late Monday on MSNBC. “We have a big need. It’s monumental.”

But Senate Republicans are in no rush to spend what could be trillions more on aid.

“I don’t think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately,” McConnell told reporters Monday at the Capitol.

McConnell said he has been in close contact with the White House, assessing the aid Congress has already approved in response to the virus outbreak and next steps.

Trump is expected to meet Tuesday with a group of Senate Republicans. “If we decide to go forward, we’ll go forward together,” McConnell said. His priority is to ensure any new package includes liability protections for health care providers and businesses that are reopening.

Senate Republicans are not expected to act on any further aid until after the Memorial Day recess, according to a senior Republican aide unauthorized to discuss the planning and granted anonymity.

The Senate is set to recess at the end of next week for a previously scheduled break, with senators scheduled to return June 1.

The Senate recently reopened its side of the Capitol while the House remains largely shuttered due the the health concerns.

Senators have been in session since last week, voting on Trump’s nominees for judicial and executive branch positions and other issues. The Senate majority, the 53-member Senate Republican conference, is meeting for its regular luncheons most days, spread out three to a table for social distance. Democrats are convening by phone. Many senators, but not all, are wearing masks.

At least a dozen Capitol police officers and other staff have tested positive for the virus, and at least one senator, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, is in isolation at home after exposure from a staff member who tested positive. Other lawmakers have cycled in and out of quarantine.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned that if Trump and congressional Republicans “slow walk” more aid they will be repeating President Herbert Hoover’s “tepid” response to the Great Depression.

422,422,519,Clean energy could get Americans back to work post-pandemic,"Transforming America into a country that runs on clean energy is one way experts hope to alleviate the devastating economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. With unemployment soaring and oil prices in a free fall, it’s looking highly unlikely that the US will simply step back into “business as usual.” Even though the pandemic is still raging, policy experts, climate action advocates, and scientists have all started drawing up plans that could save Americans from both the ravages of climate change and the economic fallout of COVID-19.

“Right now is the ideal time to be investing in renewable energy”

“Right now is the ideal time to be investing in renewable energy that can produce millions of family-sustaining wage jobs across the United States,” says Mark Paul, a political economist at New College of Florida.

Paul is one of the co-authors of a $2 trillion “green stimulus” that aims to create millions of jobs by dramatically expanding renewable energy capacity and retooling the nation’s infrastructure for the transition away from fossil fuels. Smaller plans have also grown at state and local levels. A petition coming out of New York asks for $500 billion to help states with budget shortfalls and expand clean energy.

The basic idea is that federal spending on a cleaner future would put Americans back to work, shift the balance of power away from polluting industries with big lobbying budgets, and meet key deadlines for climate action that scientists say are necessary to limit the damage done by climate change.

Renewables like solar and wind create more jobs per unit of energy delivered than coal or natural gas, a 2010 study published in the journal Energy Policy found. While $1 million in stimulus spending on oil and natural gas generated roughly five jobs, the same amount would result in 13 to 14 jobs in wind and solar, a 2009 report found.

solar and wind create more jobs per unit of energy delivered than coal or natural gas

Those numbers were crunched as the policymakers tried to figure out how to rebound from a different economic crisis — the 2008 Great Recession. Paul says one lesson learned from the Great Recession is that it isn’t too early to start planning ahead. After all, the climate crisis is expected to take its own toll on the global economy. Weaning the planet off the fossil fuels that are heating it up could help nip that financial crisis in the bud.

“The biggest challenge for COVID now will be managing the return to work, but then having work to go back to that opens up real opportunities — and that’s what this clean energy investment would do,” says Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley and a co-author of the green stimulus proposal and the 2010 paper in Energy Policy.

The threats posed by climate change make the transition to renewables more urgent than ever. As technology advanced and the cost of making and installing solar panels has dropped, renewable energy became a bigger part of the US energy mix. The Obama-era stimulus package that included a $90 billion investment in clean energy also gave the industry a boost over the past decade.

Yet despite expanding rapidly since 2008, renewables still only made up 11 percent of US energy consumption in 2018. That’s not nearly enough if the US wants to meet the targets laid out in the Paris Agreement that scientists say are necessary to avoid catastrophic effects of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels need to be cut nearly in half from 2010 levels by 2030, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

To tackle the climate crisis, we need to clean up our energy system over the next 15 years. The narwhal curve shows us the challenge—and the opportunity.



Thrilled to share this video based on my new book, Short Circuiting Policy.pic.twitter.com/vcS9hpKvVm — Leah Stokes (@leahstokes) April 27, 2020

“We are not moving fast enough on renewable energy and the stimulus is an amazing opportunity to move faster,” Leah Stokes, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara and author of the new book, Short Circuiting Policy: Interest Groups and the Battle Over Clean Energy and Climate Policy in the American States. If the US powers its electricity and transportation sectors entirely with renewables, that would slash its carbon emissions by more than half, Stokes proposes.

Jobs wouldn’t just come from building new solar and wind farms. To support the influx of energy from renewables, the nation’s energy grid would need to grow twice as large, she says. America’s grid was built to support fossil fuels; power is generated at centralized locations and then travels long distances over transmission lines to power peoples’ homes and businesses. Renewable energy generation, on the other hand, is distributed more widely. There’s also the issue of intermittency: the amount of energy coming into the grid from wind and solar farms across the US can vary with the weather. So an updated and expanded grid needs to be able to get excess renewable energy generated in one location to other places that need it.

Getting all of that done is a massive undertaking that would require a lot of boots on the ground. Paul argues that clean energy can offer a new career path for many of the millions of people who’ve lost their jobs recently. The distributed nature of renewables also means they have the potential to employ people locally across all 50 states, rather than tying jobs to regions with rich oil, gas, or coal deposits.

The number of jobs in solar and wind are expected to grow rapidly through 2028, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Solar panel system installers and wind turbine technicians are the fastest growing occupations in the country. The number of people in each occupation was expected to climb by 63 percent and 57 percent respectively by 2028, but that was before the pandemic hit. Now, the industry will need some support from governments to keep that momentum going.

New York state, despite being the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US, is still betting on renewables to help it recover from the pandemic and avert more crises caused by climate change. In April, it passed a measure to speed up the siting process for new renewable energy projects as part of its 2020-2021 budget, even as other budget items fell by the wayside because of the economic crunch caused by the virus.

“Keeping us on track [for climate targets] will be a driver of construction jobs. It will be an opportunity to help the broader state economy get back on track with what was already a fast growing sector,” says Alicia Barton, president and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. “Hopefully if we can think smartly about things the state can do and potentially see investments from the federal government, we have a good opportunity to seize a challenging moment and turn it into a moment of opportunity.”

“Keeping us on track [for climate targets] will be a driver of construction jobs.”

While there’s opportunity, there are also significant roadblocks. States like New York, which already had ambitious plans to scale up renewable energy but was also hard hit by the pandemic, shed thousands of clean energy jobs since the pandemic started. Projects are languishing during stay-at-home orders. More than half of American solar workers were either laid off or faced cutbacks, according to an April survey by the Solar Energy Industries Association. Thirty-five thousand jobs and $35 billion in investments in wind energy are jeopardized by the COVID-19 pandemic, the American Wind Energy Association reports.

“It’s unfortunately safe to say that we are going to be headed into a pretty deep economic downturn, even when our economies slowly open up,” says Noah Kaufman, a researcher at Columbia University. “These are things that are going to be very bad for all industries including the renewable industry. Spending is going to be down; it’ll be harder to get financing.”

“The best thing that the government can do for the economy is work to rev the economy back up to full speed as quickly as possible through deficit spending,” Paul says. Skeptics of proposals like a Green New Deal have balked at the price tag of retooling the nation’s energy infrastructure. But the economic disaster following the pandemic has squashed much of the political aversion to deficit spending — the question now is how to spend that money.

more hurdles for clean energy growth

The question of how to best spend deficit money will be hashed out by politicians, and that presents even more hurdles for continued clean energy growth. Renewable industries’ asks of the federal government have so far been pretty modest. They’ve pushed for an extension of tax credits that expire this year, which they could miss out on as projects are stalled. Republicans and fossil fuel lobbyists have sought to block even that, as the Trump administration has prioritized boosting coal, oil, and natural gas.

And while states, cities, and the private sector had stepped up to cut their greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, they’re now tightening purse strings — which could stymie renewable energy growth and other efforts to take action on climate change.

To top it all off, the $2 trillion green stimulus proposed by Paul and others patches together policy recommendations from Democratic candidates who’ve dropped from the presidential race — so it’s unlikely that the proposal will pick up enough steam at the federal level to be put in action while Republicans are in charge. A lot will ride on the outcome of November elections.

If the plan did actually become reality, it would be more of an extended recovery plan instead of a quick injection of money. Paul and others who crafted the proposal write that their $2 trillion plan “focuses on the longer-term challenge of jumpstarting economic recovery and transitioning to a more sustainable economy.”

But in an economic emergency like this one, speed does need to play a role. Even with the long-term goal of decarbonization, a stimulus needs to quickly put money in the hands of people who’ll spend it, Kaufman explains. That ought to inform what kinds of energy and infrastructure projects should move forward as part of any kind of plan to boost the economy.

Building a high-speed renewable-energy rail line across the country, for example, could create jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation — but it could also get mired in permitting and legal issues for years. On the other hand, grants or subsidies for shovel-ready solar and wind projects and funding for energy-efficiency retrofits would get federal dollars to people much faster. More localized renewable energy projects are also quicker to get off the ground, in general, than new oil and gas infrastructure like pipelines that cross state borders and often get held up in court for years, Kammen at Berkeley says.

“Clean energy really has a leg up, certainly over dirty energy.”

Beyond getting people back to work, clean energy spending solves other problems. It would curb air pollution that burdened certain communities with more preexisting health conditions and made them particularly vulnerable to the novel coronavirus. And by cutting out fossil fuels, the US avoids scenarios where the climate crisis could cost the US economy hundreds of billions of dollars each year by 2090. “It would be silly to design a stimulus package and not also try to have the spending lead to long term benefits. All else equal, you’d much rather build a bridge than have people dig ditches and then fill them in again,” Kaufman adds. “From that regard, I think, clean energy really has a leg up, certainly over dirty energy.”

The COVID-19 crisis can be looked at as a canary in the coal mine, says Eric Orts, professor at Wharton and director of the business school’s Initiative for Global Environmental Leadership. “One thing we can do is learn from this so that with respect to climate change we don’t do the same thing that we’ve just done with respect to the coronavirus, which is fail to listen to the scientists, fail to change, fail to get ready.”",1

1172,1172,1483,Questions arise on coronavirus data used to back reopenings,"The firing of a Florida state health official who says she refused orders to change data on coronavirus cases has raised questions about some of the statistics that governors have used to justify ending lockdown orders.

Rebekah Jones, who designed and managed the state’s COVID-19 dashboard, told CBS News 12 in West Palm Beach that her departure earlier this month was “not voluntary” and that she was removed from her position because she was ordered to censor some data. She said she refused to “manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.”

In an email to her colleagues alerting them to her departure two weeks ago, Jones wrote, “As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months. After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it.”

Jones served as the geographic information system manager for the Florida Department of Health’s Division of Disease Control and Health Protection. The dashboard had been previously praised by White House coronavirus adviser Dr. Deborah Birx. The state’s governor, Ron DeSantis, is a Republican and close ally of President Trump who initially hesitated to fully shut down the state and has pushed for reopening.

“The Florida COVID-19 Dashboard was created by the Geographic Information System (GIS) team in the Division of Disease Control and Health Protection at the Florida Department of Health,” DeSantis spokesperson Helen Aguirre Ferré told the Miami Herald in a statement. “Although Rebekah Jones is no longer involved, the GIS team continues to manage and update the Dashboard providing accurate and important information that is publicly accessible.”

In an email to the news site Florida Today on Tuesday, Jones said, “I worked on it alone, sixteen hours a day for two months, most of which I was never paid for, and now that this has happened I’ll probably never get paid for,” confirming that she had not just been reassigned on May 5, but fired.

194,194,264,31% Can’t Pay the Rent: ‘It’s Only Going to Get Worse’,"
First it was the waitress whose restaurant closed. Then the waiter, the bartender, the substitute teacher, the hairdresser, the tattoo artist and the Walgreens manager.
One after the other, the tenants called and emailed their landlord, Bruce Brunner, to say they were out of work and the rent was going to be late. A week after the bill was due, some two dozen of Mr. Brunner’s 130 tenants had lost their jobs or had their hours reduced. He’s working out payment plans and using security deposits as a stopgap while directing tenants to the emerging patchwork of local, state and federal assistance programs.
“Six weeks ago, you could name your price and you’d have multiple people applying,” said Mr. Brunner, who lives in Minneapolis, where he owns and manages 20 duplexes and triplexes across the city. “Now you’re deferring and working out payment plans, and it’s only going to get worse.”
One week after the first of the month, tenants nationwide are already struggling with rents. In interviews with two dozen landlords — including companies with tens of thousands of units, nonprofit developers who house the working poor, and mom-and-pop operators living next door to their tenants — property owners say their collections have plunged as much of the economy has shut down to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
Daryl Carter, chief executive of Avanath Capital, a Southern California company with 10,000 units across the country, said his buildings reduced April rents by 10 percent. Deidre Schmidt, chief executive of CommonBond Communities, a nonprofit affordable-housing provider with about 6,000 apartments in the Midwest, expects as many as 40 percent of her tenants, most of them hourly workers with low incomes, to fall behind on their monthly bills. Joseph Razavian, a part-time landlord in Atlanta who works at a software company but owns a duplex and a triplex as investments, is bolstering his reserve fund by putting off nonessential maintenance like fresh paint and new rain gutters.
“The whole market just changed,” said Gustavo Lopez, a property manager in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Nearly 10 million people have filed unemployment claims over the past two weeks. It’s too early to gauge how broadly these numbers will translate to the loss of rent: Many tenants are within the grace period before their rent is declared late. Some can stitch things together for a while by getting deferrals, applying their security deposits or paying with credit cards.
Still, early findings suggest that April is looking bad and lend credence to Mr. Brunner’s opinion that May will be much worse. The National Multifamily Housing Council, a trade group for big apartment owners and developers, compiled data tracking rent payments across some 13.4 million units nationwide. It showed that through the first five days of April, 31 percent of tenants had so far failed to pay their rent, compared with 18 percent in the same period a year ago.
That lined up with surveys released by Apartment List, a rental listing service; Mynd Property Management; and Avail, a platform that helps small landlords manage rentals. All showed the share of partial or unpaid rent surging to as much as a quarter of billings, compared with March or last April.
Some tenants are simply moving out. College students are breaking leases to move home. Laid-off workers are showing up at rental offices to exchange their keys for their deposits, saying they are moving in with family members.
And there is Terra Thomas, a florist in Oakland, Calif., who could pay her April rent with savings if she wanted but has decided to withhold the $833 she pays for her studio. With her usually busy wedding season shaping up to be grim, she’d rather conserve her money than pay bills now.
“This could last a long time and be really, really serious, so I don’t want to be asking myself in a few months, ‘Why did I give away my last few paychecks to rent?’” she said. “I need to know that I can eat and pay for health care.”
The $2 trillion CARES Act, signed by President Trump on March 27, should in theory help laid-off tenants keep up with the rent through a combination of expanded unemployment insurance and one-time stimulus payments. The act also included aid to public-housing providers and grants to state governments that could be used for rental assistance.
But only a sliver of the money deals with housing directly. About $12 billion in grants will mostly be given to cities, homeless shelters, affordable-housing providers and states to support people who are homeless and sustain or increase housing assistance. There are big gaps in assistance for tenants as well as landlords, because almost all of it is directed to renters and owners already attached to some sort of government program.
For instance, much of the aid to tenants is earmarked for those living in subsidized and public housing, and much of the mortgage forbearance will benefit landlords whose loans are backed by the government through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is little help to most moderate- and low-income tenants who live in market-rate developments, or small landlords whose loans are often held by private lenders and not backed by the federal government.
Cities and states have tried to address housing troubles by passing eviction moratoriums, which should prevent an immediate rise in homelessness but doesn’t resolve what happens in three or four months when tenants who have had little or no income are billed for months of back rent.
“Eventually the moratoriums will be lifted, and we don’t want to create an environment where low-income renters fall off a financial cliff and we have a rash of evictions,” said Diane Yentel, chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, an advocacy group in Washington.
After lobbying for grants to homeless providers in the CARES Act, her group is pushing for $100 billion in direct subsidies to tenants. The National Multifamily Housing Council has called for similar aid. Ms. Yentel, in an interview, cited two objectives: to relieve tenants of rent burden, but also to support small landlords at risk of foreclosure.
For several decades, the nation’s affordable-housing stock has fallen sharply, particularly “naturally occurring affordable housing” — run-down buildings that offer low rents without government subsidy. Since much of this housing is operated by smaller landlords, Ms. Yentel fears that without any aid to landlords, the buildings could go into default and be picked up by investors who will renovate them for higher-paying tenants after the crisis subsides.
“One way or the other, we have to get aid to smaller landlords so that the precious affordable-housing stock we have still exists on the other end of this crisis,” she said.
According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, a quarter of the nation’s 44 million renter households paid more than half their income in rent in 2018. Separate research from the Federal Reserve showed four in 10 Americans would have difficulty covering a sudden $400 expense, suggesting that tens of millions of tenants are just a week of missed work away from falling behind on their housing bills.
For the past four years, rent increases have helped stir a nationwide tenant uprising that led to the biggest expansion of tenants’ rights in decades. Rent control laws were enacted in New York, Oregon and California, and tenants organized mass actions, like a group of mothers in Oakland who occupied an empty house for two months to protest house flipping.
Now, after years of coordination, organizers see the coronavirus pandemic as a galvanizing force. Last week, the Right to the City Alliance, a national coalition of tenant and racial-justice organizations, held a digital #CancelRent rally to call for rents to be eliminated as long as people can’t work. Homes Guarantee, a national tenants’ campaign, has been holding weekly strategy calls. On Wednesday, a caravan outside US Bank Plaza in Minneapolis honked horns and waved signs to demand rent and mortgage relief.
“This is a moment of clarity about a broken system in which 11 million people were already paying over 50 percent of their income on rent,” said Tara Raghuveer, a tenant organizer in Kansas City and director of Homes Guarantee.
Ms. Thomas, the renter refusing to pay in Oakland, is a member of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, an activist group associated with the house-occupying mothers. For weeks she has been trying to organize her building in a rent strike, and has gotten tenants in three other units to join her.
One is her upstairs neighbor Andrew Yen, a data scientist at an agriculture company who still has a job and isn’t worried about making his $2,500 monthly rent. He and Ms. Thomas had been discussing some sort of coordinated action, but after weeks of job losses, and walking around his neighborhood seeing “rent strike” posted on telephone poles or spray-painted on utility boxes, he decided the time was now, so he is striking in solidarity.
“I feel like rent striking is the least somebody like me can do,” he said. “I’m the tenant the landlord wants to keep, so the worst-case scenario is eviction, but I probably have a lot more wiggle room than that.”",1

The month also ended a two-year streak where of job openings outnumbered unemployed workers. At the end of March, there were 1.2 people for every open job, according to the report.

Separations surged to a series-high 14.5 million, led by a spike in layoffs.

US job openings slumped on the last day of March as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic began to take hold.

Available positions fell to 6.2 million in March from 7 million in February, according to the Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department Friday. The median economist estimate was for a fall to 5.8 million, according to Bloomberg data.

""The JOLTS data for March only captured part of the coronavirus shock, but the numbers released this morning are still astounding,"" Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed, said in a Friday note.

He continued: ""Workers lost jobs at a horrifying rate. And back in March, the coronavirus shock was only being felt in the second half of the month.""

It's the latest report to show just how much the coronavirus pandemic and country-wide shutdowns to contain the disease have divested the US labor market. Since mid-March,36.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurancece, a Thursday report showed. Last week's April jobs report showed that the US economy erased 20.5 million payrolls during the month, and the unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression.

The rate of hires also decreased in March to 5.2 million from nearly 5.9 million in February. Separations surged to 14.5 million, a series high, led by a spike in layoffs. The largest increase in layoffs was seen in the accommodation and food services industry, which had 4.14 million during the month.

Nevertheless, with stay-at-home orders lifting across the nation and businesses reopening, many employees will be returning to the workplace soon.

States including Alaska, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia have at least partly lifted shutdown orders in recent days. On Wednesday, Wisconsin's Supreme Court struck down Gov. Tony Evers' stay-at-home order and bars and restaurants in the state have already started welcoming back crowds.

While no one wants to be furloughed or unemployed indefinitely, recent surveys show that Americans have mixed feelings about returning to work right now. A Bankrate survey notes that 55% of Americans believe businesses are reopening too soon and 43% say they will shop less in public than before the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines to help businesses as they reopen. The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), a workplace safety nonprofit, has provided some guidelines for retail, restaurants, salons, gyms and other service providers and their employees at its Back to Work Safely site. And USA TODAY's reporters and columnists have answers to some common questions people have as businesses reopen:

Must employers ensure the workplace is safe? And will they be held liable if employees contract the virus?

While health care providers must follow federal safety guidelines to guard against contagion, other businesses are not obligated to do so, leaving it to states and localities to set standards, experts say.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires employers to establish a workplace that’s “free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm” to employees. To meet that standard, OSHA is advising businesses to follow CDC guidelines, including instructing employees to keep six feet away from co-workers or customers, taking temperatures, disinfecting surfaces, and providing face masks, hand sanitizers and barriers when appropriate.

America reopens amid pandemic:Are lockdowns being relaxed in my state? Here's how America is reopening amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In most states, employees who can file a claim through workers’ compensation must take that route and relinquish the right to sue. Meanwhile, winning such a claim can be difficult, with workers having to prove they contracted coronavirus on the job – a high bar during a pandemic. A better case could be made if several employees at a workplace contracted the virus.

“Even though it's recognized that some groups of workers are at elevated risk of catching a virus, there's still that reality that they may be catching it outside of work,” says John Ruser, CEO of the Workers Compensation Research Institute, an independent group that analyzes workers compensation issues. “The burden of proof would be pretty heavy for them to show that it was work-related.”

If your co-worker gets COVID-19 and you fear you'll be infected, can you quit and collect unemployment?

Generally, you can only qualify for unemployment if you lost your job due to COVID-19, you’ve left your job to take care of family member who has been infected, or you’re quarantining on the advice of a health care provider and you’re unable to perform your duties.

In fact, guidance in regards to the CARES act specifically states that quitting a job without cause to get benefits would be deemed fraud. You would have to prove you were possibly exposed to the virus.

If you believe your employer’s response to the possible spread of COVID-19 creates “a serious safety hazard” or if you think your employer is not following federal work safety standards, you can file a complaint with OSHA.

My boss is hiring people to replace those of us who were laid off, and reducing existing employees' hours by half. Is that legal for a business that received PPP funds?

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) does not require businesses to rehire the same people that were laid off. It only requires that the loan will be forgiven if at least 75% of the total amount is spent on personnel with the remainder on work-related costs, such as rent, mortgage, or utilities. If you believe your boss has acted improperly or illegally, you could contact your local or state labor agency to file a complaint.

I am concerned my job puts me at high risk for COVID-19. Can I ask my employer to furlough me?

You can’t refuse to come to work based on anxiety over exposure alone. Keep in mind that 31% percent of employers have laid-off workers and 15% have permanently cut the headcount with no intention to rehire, so asking for a furlough could be risky unless your company is already taking that measure. Your employer is not obliged to grant your request – and it could offend or upset your boss so carefully consider whether you want to make that move.

I have Type 1 diabetes, so I'm at risk for the coronavirus. People in the office are sick but are not staying home. Can I ask to work from home?

Type I diabetes can be considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Working from home may be a reasonable accommodation your employer could be required to consider. In addition, you are at high risk during this pandemic according to the CDC.

Talk to your supervisor about it: Outline how working from home won’t impact productivity. Describe what your setup will be and how it allows you to work well without being in the workplace – and take notes.

419,419,516,Coronavirus causes worst smartphone market contraction in history,"The coronavirus pandemic has caused the smartphone market to suffer its fastest ever first-quarter year-on-year decline, according to new data from analyst firms. Counterpoint Research and Canalys both put the overall drop in global shipments at 13 percent, though Counterpoint says the drop in China alone was 27 percent while Canalys calculates it at 18 percent.

Whichever numbers you look at, the situation is clear: it’s the first time shipments have come under 300 million since 2014, with a precipitous collapse in China preceding falling demand around the world. “By the end of the quarter, as COVID-19 started to spread to other regions, and lockdowns of varying severity were imposed, the pendulum of disruption started to swing from supply to demand,” Counterpoint’s team of analysts writes in a statement.

Samsung, Huawei, and Apple are still the top three vendors, with Apple seeing the smallest decline in shipments year on year. Both Canalys and Counterpoint rank Xiaomi fourth, cracking 10 percent of global market share for the first time.

“Demand for new devices has been crushed,” says Canalys senior analyst Ben Stanton. “In February, when the coronavirus was centered on China, vendors were mainly concerned about how to build enough smartphones to meet global demand. But in March, the situation flipped on its head. Smartphone manufacturing has now recovered, but as half the world entered lockdown, sales plummeted.”

“From the consumer standpoint, unless replacing a broken phone, smartphones are mostly a discretionary purchase,” says Counterpoint associate director Tarun Pathak. “Consumers, under these uncertain times, are likely to withhold making many significant discretionary purchases. This means the replacement cycles are likely to become longer.”

The true impact of the pandemic is yet to be felt. “Most smartphone companies expect Q2 to represent the peak of the coronavirus’ impact,” says Stanton. “It will test the mettle of the industry, and some companies, especially offline retailers, will fail without government support.”",1
1167,1167,1455,Letter: We need a COVID-19 Marshall Plan,"We may be approaching an existential tipping point for our Republic. I do not believe this is hyperbolic for the following reasons: massive unemployment, a restless, heavily armed citizenry and a government refusing or incapable of providing solutions.

A few weeks ago, we saw a preview of what could come when discontented citizens roamed the halls of the Michigan Capitol armed with assault rifles. Although the misspelled protest signs became the butt of late-night comics, the real signs were ominous. Most likely the men with assault rifles never had the courage to serve in the military, but they can still spew 45 deadly rounds in a minute. That was not free speech — it was intended to intimidate and threaten.

Throughout history (think Weimar Republic) political threats are a pre-cursor to real violence. It is true that only a fringe of society roams around with Confederate flags, and assault rifles, but it is also true that most of the rest us are profoundly anxious about the future. If history has taught us anything, it is that we need a massive government program to address those fears.

We need a COVID Marshall Plan.

Protestors brandishing guns gather at the state Capitol steps to oppose Gov. Whitmer's stay home orders in response to the spread of coronavirus in Michigan (Photo: Andy Morrison)

As the number of unemployed exceed Great Depression levels, we should be reminded of what distinguished us from what happened in Germany and Italy: Roosevelt’s New Deal. What saved Europe from degenerating into chaos and despotism after WWII was the Marshall Plan. We need a massive jobs program with guaranteed income for working families to survive.

Employing people to track people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 will require over a million people. Industries can be retooled to produce PPE and therapeutics. Infrastructure projects could easily be accomplished with adequate protection for workers.

For service workers who cannot return to work in the foreseeable future, a guaranteed income would provide support until work becomes available. If we can give trillions to save corporations, we can spare a couple thousand per month for citizens to make us safe and to rebuild the country.

What we lack is any political leadership to design such a plan.

We are already in social turmoil. The militia types obviously have no fear of parading their threats in public. The economy will not recover soon. A predictable second wave of infection (with much more severe consequences) will cause citizens to drift toward the political extremes.

Instead of leaving Americans to sit at home watching endless news of doom while facing disastrous debt, why not put our country to work and really focus on a better future?

255,255,331,New York Orders Residents to Wear Masks in Public,"
Imposing a stricter measure to control the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he would start requiring people in New York to wear masks or face coverings in public whenever social distancing was not possible.
The order will take effect on Friday and will apply to people who are unable to keep six feet away from others in public settings, such as on a bus or subway, on a crowded sidewalk or inside a grocery store.
“Stopping the spread is everything,” Mr. Cuomo said during his daily briefing in Albany. “How can you not wear a mask when you’re going to come close to a person?”
The new requirements are bound to make face coverings an inescapable and perhaps jarring sight in New York City for the foreseeable future. They could also introduce a level of mutual obligation and civic duty about wearing masks in public that is more firmly established in Asia than in the West.
Maryland also announced on Wednesday that it would require people to wear masks in public.Mr. Cuomo said local governments would enforce the order, but he noted that riders without face coverings would not be ejected from public transit. The pandemic has devastated New York’s public transit system, with 59 workers having died of the virus and 2,269 testing positive for the infection.
The state would consider issuing civil penalties to people who fail to abide by the order, but not criminal penalties: “You’re not going to go to jail for not wearing a mask,” Mr. Cuomo said.
Permitted face coverings include proper masks, as well as scarves or bandannas, the governor said.A similar rule was issued in New Jersey last week. The order, issued by Gov. Philip D. Murphy, made it mandatory for all people inside stores and other essential businesses to wear face coverings unless they are under 2 years old or have a medical condition that prevents them from wearing a mask.
Signs have popped up at stores throughout New Jersey warning customers that they will not be allowed in unless they cover their faces. Some stores have taken a stronger stance, asking people without coverings to leave.
“These restrictions that I have laid out must be followed throughout the state,” Mr. Murphy said last week. “We are taking the step to protect both customers and essential workers.”
The mandates were the latest public safety measures from two states that are at the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. New York and New Jersey have worked in tandem since the outbreak reached the region, shuttering nonessential businesses at the same time and recently forming a coalition with neighboring states to coordinate the reopening of their economies.
In announcing Maryland’s order on masks in public settings, Gov. Larry Hogan said, “The wearing of masks is something we may have to become more accustomed to in order to safely reopen our state.”
New York, New Jersey and Maryland are so far the only states to have issued broad orders mandating face coverings in most public settings, according to the most recent information from the National Governors Association. Puerto Rico and Guam have implemented similar measures.
Nonbinding guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourage people to wear face coverings in settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain to prevent the transmission of the virus. The infection spreads primarily through droplets generated when, for instance, a sick person coughs or sneezes.
That federal recommendation was issued after research showed that many people were infected with the virus but did not show symptoms.
Across New Jersey, businesses were still grappling with the enforcement of the new rules, which some people have flouted, leading to arrests in some instances.
Supermarkets have posted signs on their doors telling customers they cannot come in without a mask, but some shoppers have refused to wear coverings and laughed off the requirement, said Matt Fattah, the owner of a C-Town supermarket in Jersey City.
“A lot of people think they don’t have to follow the rules,” Mr. Fattah said. “My employees are all on board, wear masks and gloves 100 percent of the time. Customers, first few days, it was an issue. Like the bag ban, a lot of customers thought it was a joke, that we were joking.”
Earlier this week, the owners of a toy store in Lakewood, a town near the Jersey Shore, were charged with violating the order after police spotted about 10 people crowded inside the shop. Only three of them were wearing masks, according to the police.
And in Pleasantville, a town just west of Atlantic City, a 35-year-old man was arrested on several charges, including violating emergency orders, after he came into a Dunkin’ Donuts without a mask and refused to leave after employees asked him to.
Col. Patrick J. Callahan, superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, said the police would continue to cite and arrest those who ignored orders mandating social distancing and the wearing of masks.
“Because lives are at stake, enforcement action will be taken without hesitation against those who are blatantly placing the lives of others at risk,” he said in a statement.
Mr. Murphy, the New Jersey governor, said it was up to businesses to set their own policies on how to deal with customers who do not wear a face covering.
The state order does allow people who refuse to wear a mask for medical or other reasons to enter a store and spend a limited amount of time shopping for essential goods, Parimal Garg, the state’s deputy chief counsel, explained during Mr. Murphy’s briefing on April 8.
“I think that’s benevolent,” Mr. Murphy responded. “I’d prefer to even be tougher than that.”K.C. Rondello, a disaster epidemiologist at the College of Nursing and Public Health at Adelphi University in New York, said the mask requirement would ensure compliance from those who would otherwise ignore voluntary guidelines.
“If ultimately these laws lead to greater compliance with social distancing recommendations, then they will have a very real and quantifiable effect on morbidity and mortality,” he said. “It may be difficult for people to understand or appreciate the value of a face covering. They may think, ‘What could a bandanna possibly do?’ But it can make an enormous difference.”
In New York, Mr. Cuomo said the new measures were necessary as the state continued to rein in the spread of the virus: On Tuesday, the three-day average of the number of virus patients in hospitals — considered one of the most reliable measures of the virus’s impact — fell for the first time since the outbreak began.
“All people in public must have a mask or nose covering, mouth and nose covering, and they must wear it in a situation where you cannot or are not maintaining social distancing,” Mr. Cuomo said.
The governor said a mask was not necessary if, for example, a person was walking down an empty street. But, he said, “You’re now at an intersection and there are people at the intersection and you’re going to be in proximity to other people? Put the mask on.”
He added, “You don’t have a right to infect me.”Kevin Armstrong and Lauren Hard contributed reporting from New Jersey.",1

For more free coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, sign up for our daily Coronavirus Updates newsletter where all stories are free to read.

The District, Maryland and Virginia have been in a near-total shutdown for months to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, but Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) are beginning to relax restrictions in their states. However, areas in the D.C. region that have been hit hard can delay reopening plans.

Northern Virginia will not begin to reopen until May 28 at the earliest — two weeks behind the rest of the state. In Maryland, leaders in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties have said it’s too soon to reopen.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) also says it’s too early to lift measures for the District, which had been set to expire Friday. Instead, she extended the city’s stay-at-home order, mass-gathering ban and closure of nonessential businesses through June 8, and at least until the decline in new cases lasts two weeks.

All three jurisdictions are looking for signs that the coronavirus “curve” — the number of infections over time — is flattening. They’ve set goals for increased testing capacity, a greater number of hospital beds and more protective equipment for front-line workers.

Despite rigid stay-at-home orders, hundreds of new cases are still reported each day. The number of known novel coronavirus cases in the greater Washington region has passed 70,000, and more than 3,000 people have died of covid-19, the disease the virus causes. The newly reported cases tend to stem from confined living quarters such as nursing homes and jails or are among essential workers and those who can’t afford to miss work or are unable to telecommute.

More than 885,000 people in the District, Maryland and Virginia have lost their jobs during the past seven weeks, according to federal data.

Here are answers to frequently asked questions.

What are the current restrictions in the DMV?

Maryland and Virginia have relaxed some of the restrictions that have been in place, while the District and its suburbs remain mostly shut down.

In Virginia, some restaurants, barber shops, and hair and nail salons in areas outside Northern Virginia can reopen with limited capacity, and religious organizations are cleared to hold reduced-capacity services.

Much of Maryland has similar precautions in place, although restaurants remain closed for in-person dining. Populous areas of the state, including Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, remain closed.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser this week extended the restrictions in the city to June 8. Starting on Saturday, D.C. residents and visitors are required to wear face coverings when out in public near others, with some exceptions. People who are exercising or walking do not need to wear a mask, as long as they stay six feet away from others.

For a look across the nation, The Washington Post also has a state-by-state review of the stay-at-home orders.

When will the region reopen?

Any reopening will be gradual, with restrictions lifted in phases.

Each jurisdiction has set goals for lower infection rates, increased testing, greater hospital capacity and much more personal protective gear. Until those goals are met, local officials say most restrictions will remain in place.

In addition to rolling back restrictions outside Northern Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam (D) also may adjust the stay-at-home order that expires June 10, which restricts gatherings and other social activities.

[When will Virginia reopen?]

In Maryland, Hogan already has eased some restrictions on outdoor activities, opening public beaches and golf courses in the state. The Washington Post’s Erin Cox reports the plan is to reopen businesses and allow certain social activities in phases.

[When will Maryland reopen?]

Bowser extended the city’s stay-at-home order, ban on mass gatherings and closure of nonessential businesses through June 8. Starting Friday, however, educational and academic retail shops, such as bookstores, can seek waivers to reopen for curbside and front-door pickup sales.

The mayor has created an advisory group, led by Susan E. Rice and Michael Chertoff, to decide when and how to lift restrictions.

[When will D.C. reopen?]

Why are people still getting sick in the region?

Doctors and public health officials tell The Post the coronavirus is increasingly infecting people who cannot afford to miss work — such as grocery store employees, delivery drivers and construction workers. Despite the broad shutdown, there’s still communal spread.

Increased testing across the region helps explain why the daily case count continues to rise. “That is expected,” said Laurie Forlano, Virginia’s deputy commissioner of health. “Obviously we’ll detect more cases, and those cases will be counted.”

But health experts say the region is far from testing enough of the population, including those who are symptomatic and those who are not, to truly know who is infected. The District, Maryland and Virginia do not have enough contact tracers in place to sketch a picture of how the coronavirus is spreading.

Where can I get tested for covid-19?

New testing sites are popping up across the region. Most — but not all — sites require a doctor’s note and scheduled appointment. Clinicians are prioritizing front-line workers and adults who are 65 or older.

Local officials have repeatedly stated reopening the region will depend on how fast they can expand testing capacities in the coming weeks. Health experts say the region still needs to test far more of the population to get a clear picture of who has the virus.

Here’s an updating list of testing sites in the District, Maryland and Virginia.

Can I travel for work? Can I travel out of state?

Certain jobs are listed as essential, and those people are still allowed to travel for work. The definition of essential differs slightly in all three jurisdictions. Read more here.

Some Americans are concerned about heading to work as states reopen businesses to restart the economy. Here are common questions and answers regarding an employee’s rights when returning to work.

There are no restrictions on interstate travel in or out of the District, Maryland or Virginia. However, officials recommend those traveling in from out-of-state locations self-quarantine for 14 days.

Can I go to church, the mosque or synagogue?

Religious institutions in the southern and western parts of Virginia on Friday were cleared to resume indoor services for groups larger than 10.

Houses of worship in Maryland will be allowed to operate at 50 percent capacity — unless local governments deem it unsafe. The Post’s Sarah Pulliam Bailey and Michelle Boorstein report many religious leaders in the area are hesitant to open up their doors again.

The District allows residents to travel to places of worship, but most services have been canceled because of the limitations on gatherings in the region.

A coalition of religious leaders, business owners and Maryland state lawmakers are suing the state government over the governor’s stay-at-home orders. In the lawsuit, the group argues Hogan is violating the constitutional rights of individuals to gather to worship or engage in free speech.

Is public transportation open? Are there any restrictions?

Starting Monday, Metro will require riders to wear masks while on a bus or train. The transit agency has reduced service after “significant” drops in ridership due to regional stay-at-home orders and advised passengers to use Metro only if no other option is available.

Metro officials don’t plan for service to return to pre-pandemic levels until spring of next year, The Post’s Justin George reports. The transit agency plans to continue the current reduced-service schedule until the start of the school year.

Metrobus operates from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. During the week, buses arrive on a Sunday schedule, and over the weekend, they arrive every 30 minutes. All customers should enter and exit the bus at the rear door, except those using mobility devices or who require bus kneeling. Fares are waived during this time.

The D.C. Streetcar operates Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. for essential trips only. Passengers are encouraged to allow extra travel time, as D.C. Streetcars will arrive approximately every 20 minutes.

In Prince George’s County, residents are required to cover their faces on the county’s bus system.

Amtrak has reduced its service between Washington and Boston by as much as 35 percent, The Post’s Luz Lazo reported. All passengers on Amtrak trains and in stations are required to wear masks. The rail company will restore some service on June 1, with the return of Acela, the premier passenger trains that run through the Northeast Corridor.

When will schools open? What about colleges and universities?

Schools in Virginia, Maryland and the District are closed for the rest of the academic year, but remote learning is underway.

In the District, instruction will end in late May, instead of June 19. Some charter schools say they will remain open into June. Private schools are following their own schedules, though most are expected to remain closed through the academic year.

The public school system says it will offer summer school, though it is still unclear if that will be done in person, remotely, or a combination of the two.

Maryland officials say masks, temperature checks and shortened weeks could become the norm when students return to in-person instruction, The Post’s Donna St. George reports.

Schools in Montgomery County and Fairfax County have grappled with the complications related to transitioning to full-time online learning.

Most jurisdictions are offering free meals to students and all children, and the federal government is allowing school districts to distribute meals “to a parent or guardian to take home to their children,” The Post’s Hannah Natanson reports. Here is a list of places to pick up breakfast and lunch in the District, Maryland and Virginia.

Local colleges and universities have cleared their campuses, too, but are now facing questions about how to fill classrooms in the fall. Hundreds of colleges and universities have pushed back admission decision deadlines to June 1 and offered extensions, especially for out-of-state students.

As schools prepare for next semester, leaders are considering a few different options — including extending virtual classes, bringing students back to campus for in-person classes, or a hybrid model in which students do both. Final decisions may not come for weeks.

Officials at George Washington University said they will make a decision about next semester by June 15, though university President Thomas J. LeBlanc warned he may extend that deadline as it approaches. Jay A. Perman, chancellor of the University System of Maryland, which includes U-Md. and 14 other public universities and education centers, said he is “reasonably optimistic” campuses will reopen by September.

What’s the situation at local nursing homes?

As of late April, at least 255 nursing homes in the greater Washington region reported coronavirus cases.

Former and current employees at Maryland nursing homes tell The Post their facilities are struggling with shortages of staff, testing and personal protective equipment. Maryland regulators already have announced fines for one nursing home.

Hogan has ordered universal testing for nursing home residents and employees, making Maryland one of the first states to do so.

The federal government issued guidelines in April requiring nursing homes to update patients’ families regularly on coronavirus cases in their facilities.

Maryland health officials publish a list online of every nursing home reporting an outbreak. As of May 6, according to state data, long-term-care facilities in Maryland have accounted for more than 6,000 of the state’s coronavirus infections and more than 800 covid-19-related deaths.

The District occasionally provides a list of nursing homes with outbreaks in the mayor’s daily briefing.

Virginia reports the aggregate total of outbreaks at nursing homes across the state but does not list specific long-term-care facilities.

What businesses are open? When will other stores reopen?

In Virginia, restaurants already licensed for outdoor seating can open at half-capacity with social distancing requirements, while barber shops and hair and nail salons can open for appointments and with strict guidelines. Nonessential retail stores can open with limits on the number of customers allowed in the store. Employees are required to wear face masks, and customers are strongly encouraged to wear them.

While religious organizations can hold services, gatherings must be at 50 percent capacity and are subject to other safety requirements. Movie theaters, concert venues, amusement parks, bowling alleys and indoor gyms remain closed.

In Maryland, many similar precautions are in place, although restaurants remain closed for in-person dining. Hogan replaced a statewide stay-at-home order with a “safer at home” policy that relaxes some restrictions.

The new policy allows some nonessential retailers to reopen, including clothing and shoe stores, pet groomers, animal adoption shelters, carwashes, art galleries and bookstores. But they must remain at 50 percent capacity or less, employees must wear masks, and other social distancing restrictions must be observed.

The changes took effect at midnight in Virginia and at 5 p.m. Friday in Maryland. The changes do not apply to Northern Virginia or the Maryland suburbs.

How can I apply for local unemployment benefits?

A few weeks ago, The Post’s personal finance columnist, Michelle Singletary, shared her guidance about eligibility and how to apply for unemployment benefits.

More than 885,000 people have filed for jobless benefits in the District, Maryland and Virginia since the Washington area closed down under the stay-at-home orders.

What do I need to know about grocery shopping?

Supermarkets, convenience stores and restaurants have all adapted to meet the changing demands, now that people in the Washington region are stocking up.

Face masks are required at grocery stores in the District and Maryland, while face coverings are recommended in Virginia but not mandated. Officials recommend shoppers wash their hands before and immediately after shopping for groceries and bring their own disinfectant wipes if planning to use a shopping cart.

Stores are offering older shoppers dedicated hours, usually early in the mornings, so they can shop without crowds. The District has extended sidewalks near some grocery stores to allow for social distancing.

Farmers markers in the region are still open, but vendors often require advance orders for curbside pickup. Farmers report more people are signing up for community-supported agriculture, or CSA, preorders, and some already have waitlists for new members. Restaurants are selling staples, like milk and eggs, alongside prepared takeout fare.

Can I go for a run? What else can I do outside?

The District, Maryland and Virginia’s stay-at-home orders allowed for walking, biking, dog walking, hiking and running outside, as long as people remain six feet away from those outside their household. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people build exercise into their routines during the outbreak to keep physically and mentally healthy.

A person is allowed to walk, bike or run through a park or trail, but all three jurisdictions caution against sitting or congregating in parks or public fields.

Maryland has relaxed some restrictions on outdoor activities. Public beaches are open for exercise. Family members from one household can go camping, fishing and hunting, as well. For more on what is and is not allowed outside under all three orders, read here.

How can I help?

People can donate blood, give to a local or national nonprofit, support local bars and restaurants or help an older adult with groceries.

1102,1102,1328,Home offices are expensive: Study says most people didn't have one before coronavirus,"Stephanie Silva didn't have a proper home office set up before the coronavirus pandemic, so the transition to remote work from her Orange County, California, home over the past couple of months was ""surprisingly expensive.""

During most of April, the HR assistant sat on the floor and worked from her personal laptop. But with the COVID-19 shutdown extending into May, she and her boyfriend invested in a more comfortable setup.

They ordered a desk from Wayfair, an office chair from Amazon, ink for the printer and other home office staples. In total, they spent more than $600.

""It all added up quickly,"" Silva said. ""I had no idea it would cost this much.""

Silva is far from the only person scrambling to piece together a home office in the stay-at-home era, and setting one up from scratch isn't cheap.

In fact, most people (54%) didn't have a remote work setup before the government moved to curb nonessential gatherings, according to a survey conducted by YouGov in partnership with USA TODAY and LinkedIn. Meanwhile, 74% of professionals age 18 to 74 said they're now working from home.

Supermarket spending:April grocery store prices made highest jump in more than 40 years

Bye-bye butterfly keyboard:Apple unveils 13-inch MacBook Pro with a better typing experience

While remote work cuts down on the cost of commuting, home offices come with other sets of expenses.

People who are used to endlessly charging their laptops and other devices at the corporate office are now facing higher household electricity bills. Then, there's the expense of office furniture and reliable Wi-Fi. You may even feel pushed to invest in a printer or extra monitors.

But do companies have to reimburse you for any of these?

""It's tricky,"" said Lara Shortz, a labor attorney at Michelman & Robinson. ""But it largely depends on the state you live in.""

Several states such as California, Illinois, Minnesota and South Dakota have laws that require some sort of reimbursement for necessary work-related expenses. That means companies are more likely to cover the cost of hardware that you need to fulfill your job, like a computer or laptop, Shortz said.

Upgrades to your home internet typically wouldn't qualify for reimbursement under state laws, Shortz added.

Nearly a third of those working from home (32%) have had their calls or video chats interrupted by Wi-Fi or technology challenges, the study with LinkedIn and YouGov found. Some people are paying for more internet bandwidth to overcome these issues.

Johanna Appel, an elementary school teacher in Long Island, New York, upgraded her home internet plan to accommodate an influx of Zoom calls with dozens of faculty members and students.

Her job provided her with a Chromebook laptop, though it wasn't powerful enough, she said. She spent nearly $2,000 on a Dell HP desktop, a set of headphones and a printer since the school closed its doors in mid-March.

""I had to do it for my sanity,"" Appel said. ""I think the money was worth being spent, but I don't think I'll get reimbursed at all.""

If you use part of your home for business, you may be able to deduct some of the expenses when you file your taxes. The IRS website says the home office deduction is available for both homeowners and renters.

Not everyone can afford a comfy work setup at home. Internet providers like AT&T and Comcast have offered incentives to ease the burden. And not everyone has space to fit a work desk. But experts have tips for using what you do have.

A quality pair of headphones is a simple way to help you focus on your tasks by reducing the noise you hear around you, according to Madeline Pratt, founder of the technology consulting agency Fearless in Training.

""With people having kids, dogs and partners at home, getting a really good headset situation is critical to be clear and focused on calls,"" Pratt said.

You don't necessarily need to buy a desk in order to look professional on Zoom calls, said LinkedIn career expert Blair Heitmann. Just ""avoid couches, beds and cozy chairs that put your posture in a more relaxed position,"" Heitmann said.

These days, coworkers are understanding when it comes to occasional interruptions from kids or pets. Still, finding a dedicated space to work that's free from unnecessary distractions is essential.

""Try to find a place that is set apart from the rest of your family with a door,"" Heitmann said. ""And be sure to communicate with your family when you need some alone time.""

1402,1410,1989,Globalists in Panic: George Soros Warns EU May not Survive Coronavirus Crisis,"The coronavirus crisis is affecting the European Union on multiple levels. The union is in complete disarray economically, socially, and politically. As the block plunges into recession, anti-EU and anti-Euro sentiment is continuing to grow rapidly.

The ground zero for this sentiment is Italy. For almost a decade, Italy has been on the edge of facing a similar crisis to that of Greece. This has mainly been due to the large deficits produced by the right-wing Berlusconi governments. Since 2018, anti-establishment and anti-EU sentiment in Italy continues to grow, with anti-EU populists now making up a majority of the Italian parliament. Berlusconi’s party is now polling at 6%, while former centre-left Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s party continues to barely make the polling threshold needed to enter parliament. When the coronavirus crisis hit, right-wing populists such as Matteo Salvini and Georgia Meloni viciously went after the Euro, pushing for a return to an Italian currency to better handle the crisis. They also criticized the European Union as a whole for its late response to the coronavirus in Italy, which forced the government to turn to aid from Russia.

Their push seems to be working. According to a poll published by Tecne, 47% of Italians support leaving the Eurozone and 46% support leaving the European Union altogether. To compare, only 41% of those polled supported remaining in the union.

Italy, however, isn’t the only nation in Europe where Europskepticism is on the rise. A recent poll suggests nearly 60% of France has no trust in Brussels, up 10 points since the election of Emanuel Macron. This comes as Macron faces increased pressure to resign, this time coming from the left as 10 of his party’s MPs have switched parties. Macron, a former Rothschild banker, often dubbed as a “puppet of the big banks”, has slowly been losing control of his country. As the Yellow Vest protests are starting to revive, the president is also being faced by migrant riots. Time will tell how long Macron can hold on. Recent polling suggests that he could be ousted in the next election by the far-right Marine le Pen.

As the union struggles to hold on economically, the idea of issuing Eurobonds is being seen as an option to satisfy Italy. That option, however, may be off the table as a German court recently declared it unconstitutional. Merkel has since announced she opposes the plan.

George Soros has came out in support for the Eurobond program: “A 1 trillion-euro bond would cost 5 billion euros a year, assuming an interest rate of 0.5%. The consols would not need to be sold all at once; they could be issued in tranches and they would be snatched up by long-term investors like life insurance companies.” The move would add $1 trillion of debt to the European Union as a whole, as if Europe didn’t have enough debt.

Along with Soros, Macron has announced his support for the plan. Unlike Merkel, who at times will turn on the World Order in favor of the interests of her own nation, Macron almost always carries out the interests of those who put him in power. Despite support from Macron, the move seems more and more unlikely as Merkel has not backed down in her opposition to the plan.

Will economic troubles lead to a collapse in the union? George Soros seems to think so. “If the EU is unable to consider it now [Eurobonds], it may not be able to survive the challenges it currently confronts… This is not a theoretical possibility; it may be the tragic reality.”

With globalist leaders such as Macron and Italian Prime Minister Conte on the edge of losing power to the far-right, economic troubles for the block may trigger the collapse of both the European Union along with the establishment governments within the block. Time will tell. However, since one of the main architects of the union already echos this sentiment, we may already know the answer.

181,181,249,New York City Has Contingency Plan For Temporary Burials Of COVID-19 Dead,"New York City Has Contingency Plan For Temporary Burials Of COVID-19 Dead

Updated at 2 a.m. ET Tuesday

In New York City, as the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic continues increasing, officials say the city may have to temporarily bury some of the dead at a public cemetery in Long Island Sound.

New York City Councilman Mark Levine says that if the death toll doesn't level off soon, the city will likely start doing ""temporary interment."" New York City's data indicate that total deaths in the city averaged nearly 150 per day before the pandemic. On one day recently, the city reported that 806 people died in a single day.

In an interview, Levine said, ""It would be done in a way that allowed these bodies to then be disinterred and given a proper burial at such time as the crisis is over and our normal cemetery system and funeral home system are running again.""

In a string of tweets, he detailed contingency plans for handling the dead. Trenches, he says, would be dug in a city park for caskets that would be placed 10 in a line.

This tweet has gotten a lot of attention. So I want to clarify: the is a contingency NYC is preparing for BUT if the death rate drops enough it will not be necessary. https://t.co/6wLO8qWtML — Mark D. Levine (@MarkLevineNYC) April 6, 2020

However, later Levine clarified that the plan was only a contingency and might not be necessary — and still later that no bodies would be buried at city parks, after all. Instead, temporary interment, if necessary, would take place at a public cemetery on Hart Island, in the Bronx, he said.

""I have spoken to many folks in City gov't today, and received unequivocal assurance that there will be *no* burials in NYC Parks,"" Levine tweeted late Monday. ""All have stated clearly that if temporary interment should be needed it will be done on Hart Island.""

I have spoken to many folks in City gov’t today, and received unequivocal assurance that there will be *no* burials in NYC Parks. All have stated clearly that if temporary interment should be needed it will be done on Hart Island. 1/2 — Mark D. Levine (@MarkLevineNYC) April 6, 2020

A spokesperson for Mayor Bill de Blasio also confirmed in a tweet that the city was not planning to use parks as temporary burial sites.

We are NOT currently planning to use local parks as burial grounds. We are exploring using Hart Island for temporary burials, if the need grows. https://t.co/LfgGjULjh8 — Freddi Goldstein (@FreddiGoldstein) April 6, 2020

Levine said 80 refrigerated trailers big enough to hold 100 bodies each have been deployed to hospitals in the city. Some hospitals now have added a second and even third trailer, holding the remains of people who died from COVID-19 or other causes. With so many dead, funeral homes and cemeteries in the region are unable to keep up.

""People who lose someone to this virus, they're calling half a dozen funeral homes, and there's just no way now to get served through those normal channels,"" he says. ""You really can't get a burial in a cemetery at all now. Their resources are stretched and they have no capacity to handle the number of people who need burials.""

Asked about the city's plans for dealing with the growing number of bodies, the mayor confirmed officials were looking at contingency plans, but wouldn't go into details.

""We will have the capacity we need,"" de Blasio said. ""We may be dealing with temporary burials so we can then deal with each family later. But again, I'm not going to detail it.""

The mayor said the Defense Department had sent personnel and equipment to help, but that ""it's going to be very tough.""

Levine, who is the chairman of the New York City Council Health Committee, conceded it's a tough topic, but one he felt needed to be discussed in public. ""We need more help. We need more resources. We need more staffing for our city's mortuary system, just like we need more doctors and nurses,"" he said.",1
268,268,345,31 Deaths: Toll at Quebec Nursing Home in Pandemic Reflects Global Phenomenon,"
MONTREAL — Thirty-one people were found dead in less than a month at a nursing home in Montreal, at least five confirmed to have coronavirus — a powerful Canadian emblem of how nursing homes are among the places hardest hit by the pandemic.
In the United States 17 bodies were recently discovered at a long-term care facility in New Jersey, among 68 deaths linked to the residence, 26 confirmed as coronavirus cases. And it was at a long-term care facility in Kirkland, in Washington state, that Americans first got a glimpse of the horrors to come after residents fell ill with Covid-19 in late February.
The phenomenon has been seen across Europe as well. In Spain, soldiers sent to disinfect nursing homes found people abandoned, or even dead, in their beds. Italy, Britain and France have acknowledged that their official statistics have overlooked many virus-related deaths in long-term care facilities.
The deaths in Canada were discovered late last week at Résidence Herron, a private home for seniors in Montreal, after the local health authority, alarmed by staff shortages and the spread of coronavirus at the home, took control of the residence.
They found dehydrated residents lying listless in bed, unfed for days, with excrement seeping out of their diapers.
“I’d never seen anything like it in my 32-year nursing career,” said Loredana Mule, a nurse on the team. “It was horrific — there wasn’t enough food to feed people, the stench could’ve killed a horse.”
After she left the home, she said, she collapsed in her car and wept.A skeleton staff of two nurses had been left to care for a private residence with nearly 150 beds, she said. The remaining staff had fled amid the outbreak of the coronavirus, leaving patients, some paralyzed or with other chronic illnesses, to fend for themselves.
In announcing the deaths on Saturday, François Legault, the premier of Quebec, said there appeared to be “gross negligence.”
The Montreal police, Quebec’s health ministry and the provincial coroner’s office have begun investigations into the home. Officers from Montreal police’s major crime unit have been sifting through evidence, confiscating files and interviewing employees.
Autopsies of the dead are also expected, though families of relatives said they feared they may never learn the truth about how many residents had died of the virus since many of the bodies had been cremated.
“How is it possible that so many body bags left that place and no one raised the alarm?” Ms. Mule asked.
After discovering the deaths at the Herron, Quebec’s ministry of health this week inspected 40 private homes for the elderly, and Mr. Legault called for volunteers to fill staffing gaps at residences. On Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Quebec officials had asked the federal government for staffing help for its overwhelmed nursing homes.
Quebec is the Canadian province most severely affected by coronavirus, with 15,857 cases and 630 people dead. Health officials say retirement homes accounted for roughly half of the total deaths in Quebec.
Mr. Legault has blamed Herron’s management for the catastrophe, saying that after the residence was informed last month that a patient had tested positive for the virus, it refused to cooperate with the regional health authority, forcing it to obtain a court order and delaying intervention.
By the time a team of health care workers arrived on March 29, the coronavirus had already invaded.Résidence Herron is owned by a Quebec real estate company, Katasa, which owns six other retirement residences. A spokesman for the company declined to comment on allegations of negligence.
But Katherine Chowieri, whose father, Samir Chowieri, is president of Katasa and who is a manager at the company, denied negligence to local news outlets, telling them that she blamed the health authority for not heeding the residence’s calls for help as staff left amid a shortage of protective equipment.
On Tuesday, Patrizia Di Biase-Leone learned that her mother, Antonietta Pollice, who turned 97 on March 11 and suffers from dementia, had tested positive for the virus. She said the residence had obfuscated her mother’s condition, even as she suffered symptoms including diarrhea, dehydration and hallucinations.
“Of course, we are gravely concerned about our mom,” she said. “She is emaciated and losing the will to live. We are getting no cooperation. What do we do? Call the cops?”
The glossy website of Résidence Herron touts a nutritionist for personalized meal plans, a bistro cafe, a hairdresser and a full-time nursing staff for its elderly patients.
But families of residents said in interviews that, over several years, they had seen their relatives deprived of basic needs like diapers, exercise, proper hygiene and healthy meals, despite a monthly cost of between 3,000 and 10,000 Canadian dollars to stay there.
When the coronavirus spread to the residence, they said, they desperately struggled to get information about their loved ones, while their pleas to test their relatives for the virus were ignored.
This is not the first time the Herron’s services have come under scrutiny. Last year, a report by Quebec Health and Social Services warned that the home’s palliative care was lacking.
In 1981, Mr. Chowieri, the owner of Résidence Herron, was convicted of drug trafficking, serving about 15 months in prison. One year later he was convicted of fraud. In 1994, a seniors residence he owned was the subject of a money-laundering inquiry by the national police. And in 2002, he was fined $125,000 for tax evasion.
Frédéric Lepage, a spokesman for the company, said Samir Chowieri’s criminal record was expunged in 2014 due to good behavior.
Leane Conti, whose mother, Carole Stewart, 79, is partially paralyzed and was bedridden at Residence Herron for two years, said staff repeatedly refused to lift her mother off her bed to properly bathe her, leading to infections in her legs and feet.
She said she was chided by the residence that her mother was “urinating too much and using too many diapers.”
After her mother came down with a fever in late March and was sent to a nearby hospital, Ms. Conti said she finally learned from the hospital that there was a case of coronavirus at the residence.
Ms. Stewart was sent back to the Herron, where Ms. Conti said she wasn’t quarantined, pending test results. She has since tested positive and has been hospitalized.
“When I learned there were 31 bodies in less than a month at the Herron, I was shocked but not surprised,” she said.",1
920,920,1094,Slovenia becomes first European nation to declare an end to its coronavirus epidemic,"Slovenia has become the first European country to declare its domestic coronavirus outbreak officially over.

The country's government confirmed in a statement on Friday that its Covid-19 epidemic had ended, after Slovenia's National Institute of Public Health concluded ""all indicators point to a slowdown in the spread of the virus in the population.""

According to data from Slovenia's Ministry of Health, just one new case of the coronavirus was confirmed on Thursday, with no deaths reported. Over the past two weeks, just 35 people had been infected with the coronavirus, according to the health authority, while the reproductive number for the virus — known as the R rating or R0 — was below 1.

An R below 1 means each infected individual will on average transmit the virus to less than one other person.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Janez Jansa told parliament that the Balkan country ""has the best epidemiological picture in Europe.""

Despite declaring an end to the epidemic, the government said it would keep measures such as widescale testing, contact tracing and bans on public gatherings in place pending a review on May 31. It will also remain mandatory to wear face coverings in public spaces until at least the end of the month.",1
443,443,548,Healing Power of Light: Why Viruses Thrive in Winter but Not Summer,"Comments by Brian Shilhavy

Editor, Health Impact News

The COVID-19 situation has drawn the attention of the world to the subject of “viruses.” What are viruses, how does one treat them, and other such questions are highly controversial with very many different viewpoints.

One fact that seems to be agreed upon by everyone, is that viruses, at least the kind of “influenza” type of viruses that are seasonal, are a problem in the winter months, but not so much during the summer months.

Since daylight hours are extended during the summer, most of the research on this topic has surrounded Vitamin D, a vitamin best obtained from the sun.

But there is much more to this topic of “light,” and its effect on human health, than just Vitamin D.

Given how much attention has been given to the “coronavirus” topic, it is time to look at this issue more closely to see if there are factors during the shorter daylight winter times that can be studied and understood to improve our health during this time, without always looking for a drug or vaccine to cure everything.

So I assigned this topic to Health Impact News independent researcher and writer Crystal Lauer. She took over a month to research the topic.

During that time, President Trump and a team of researchers working with William Bryan in the Science and Technology division of the Department of Homeland Security, announced results of some their own studies within their laboratory looking at the effects of “solar radiation” and its effect on the Coronavirus, which seems to confirm that some of the research presented in this article may apply to COVID-19.

Of course, since this is a preventive measure with no patented drugs involved, the studies were quickly condemned by the medical industry, and an off comment made about disinfectants was what the corporate-sponsored “mainstream” media decided to focus on instead.

While Crystal was hesitant at first to spend so much time researching this topic, being a busy homeschool mother, in the end she reported that based on her research, her family made some big changes to their lifestyles to take better advantage of the healing power of natural light, and as a result she reported:

We found that we all are sleeping better, have much more mental energy and are overall feeling far more relaxed, even in the midst of this pandemic.

The Influence of Natural and Artificial Light on Human Biology

by Crystal Lauer

Health Impact News

The eyes are not only the windows to the soul, but the window through which light influences our biology, and while the radiation absorbed through the eyes is particularly influential on our cells, scientists suggest it is not the only way light, whether thermal or non-native, is able to affect our health.

Human cells, and in general every living thing, are optimized by the sun’s broad full spectrum of solar radiation, which starts with the higher energy UV (ultra-violet) rays beginning in the invisible range, progressing through the visible range and ending with the red-to near-infrared at the far opposite side of the spectrum.

The thermal radiation from sunlight holds the complete variations of wavelengths needed to drive our metabolic processes, balance our endocrine system, power our mitochondria, strengthen and build our bones, produce beneficial levels of the hormones dopamine and melatonin and even help prevent pathogens from damaging our bodies.

The sunlight is also known as a Chronobiologic, signaling to non-vision related receptors in our system, the changes in seasons and environment. Approximately 125 million photoreceptors in your retina are neurons transforming light waves into electrical signals which are sent to the brain.

Morning sunlight, which has the most blue light in it, will increase alertness, improve cognitive function and suppress melatonin, the sleep hormone produced in the pineal gland, when exposure occurs within the first couple hours after rising.

The rays contained in the visible blue and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum, which vary in wavelength from 380 Nanometers to 500 nanometers, are largely responsible for synchronizing your body’s clock, or Circadian rhythm, to the 24-hour solar cycle, with their short highly active waves.

Sunlight Directly or Indirectly Influences Almost Every Process in our Physiology

Extensive studies suggest that mitochondria, the powerhouse of our cells, use the near-infrared radiation, which makes up 42 percent of the sun’s light, to produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), an organic compound that provides energy to the cell.

By altering the physical properties of the water inside the cell’s membrane, the body’s most prolific chromophore which is a molecule which absorbs light, red- to near-infrared (R-NIR) light turbo-charges chemical reactions which result in cellular energy, while largely down regulating reactive oxygen species(ROS), which are responsible for oxidative stress.

This means that at an atomic level, cellular respiration allows photons in both red- and near-infrared light to excite electrons. Theses electrons break up nitric oxide bonds which compete with oxygen and clear the way for hydrogen ions(H+) to make their way through the process which will eventually lead to them becoming ATP molecules more efficiently.

This influence of red-and-infrared light on the cellular respiration has shown to be beneficial for the reduction of inflammation and pain, to improve muscle and wound recovery and even affect athletic performance for the better.

Another Way the Natural Spectrum of Light Provides Health Benefits is Through its Influence on the Immune System

By now most people are aware of the importance of Vitamin D, an ancient signaling molecule which allows the human body to cope with the increased absorption from UVB rays as the seasons change and the solar radiation in the UV range becomes more abundant.

Sunlight is efficient in producing Vitamin D, being reliant on the number of photons from the sun’s rays which are able to penetrate the skin. The increase in clothes, body fat, the use of sunscreen and our overall fear of the sun has led to epidemic levels of clinically low Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) circulating in the blood of the average individual, with numbers increasing only slightly in the summer months and falling again over the winter.

It is estimated that over a billion individuals worldwide are deficient in Vitamin D, making it a major medical health problem globally.

Part of the problem lies in the reduced exposure to adequate UVB, which is often unavailable in many regions, except for a noticeably short amount of the year. Other complications which limit exposure to Vitamin D producing solar light is overcrowded cities and polluted skies, which block the necessary UVB rays needed to create Vitamin D from cholesterol in the skin.

The fat-soluble essential vitamin, 25 hydroxyvitamin D, is necessary for proper bone mineralization, support of most metabolic functions, neuromuscular health and immune modulation.

This increase in Vitamin D production is supposed to be, in part, responsible for the decrease in viral illnesses during the summer months when the sun’s solar rays are more intense, and more people spend time outdoors in less clothes.

So, while uncoupled from the more prolific red-and-infrared spectrum of full solar radiation, high-energy short-wave UV can easily become damaging to the human body, but its overall benefits to the health of our organism is inarguable when used responsibly.

So why, over the past century, has much of the messaging concerning the sun revolved around the dangers of excessive sun exposure and not its benefits?

The effects of UVA radiation which penetrates deep into the skin tissue can, when used inappropriately, can lead to cancer indirectly through the production of harmful molecules like ROS ( reactive oxygen species) that deleteriously affect DNA or through the more direct damage done to DNA broken by UVB radiation, which is more commonly known to be responsible for sunburns, the breakdown of collagen, skin aging and the heightened risk of skin cancers.

But, while the WHO (World Health Organization) has declared the Sun, or more specifically ‘solar radiation,’ to be a group 1 carcinogen, they also acknowledge that lack of sun exposure is responsible for far more death and disease overall. Evidence strongly suggests that adequate amounts of Vitamin D3 are unable to be gotten though dietary means, leaving responsible exposure to the sun the best way to increase needed Vitamin D stores.

Still, with the prolific warnings to avoid the dangers of the sun screaming at us from bottles of sunscreen and lotions, commercials, medical websites and posters for more than half a century, it’s no wonder we eventually stopped questioning the message and, in large part, accepted the idea that nature was attempting to kill us through her thermal light.

Eventually many of us went inside our tightly-constructed homes, flipped on our cost-efficient LEDs, turned on our televisions, scrolled through our smart devices and avoided the obvious hazards which lurked just outside, happily safe from the sun and bathed in the comforting blue glow of technology.

But not all light is created equal, and some scientists are now worried at the amount of time people spend exposed to non-thermal light sources.

Appearances can be deceiving and while we perceive the combination of the colored light waves in the solar spectrum to be a white light, it’s really a combination of distinct colored light waves with varying lengths containing energy in the visible spectrum that scientists say ranges from 380 Nanometers at the blue end to approximately 780 nanometers at the red end.

“Blue” light, which makes up approximately one third of the visible light spectrum, is a short high-energy visible (HEV) wave.

It is also the predominate light wave represented in light-emitting diodes, better known as LEDs. Because they are highly efficient to the tune of decreasing energy requirements as much as 95 percent when compared to the older incandescent thermal light bulbs, LEDs have largely replaced their inefficient counterparts.

This single change to our indoor environments may be far more disruptive than proponents could have appreciated.

While the heat from the old incandescent and halogen bulbs was an infrared that bestowed beneficial health effects and balanced the spectrum of light, the new LED bulbs are a non-native EMF radiation source which some photo biologists are warning can lead to age-related macular degeneration, through damage to photoreceptor cells and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Because blue light exposure causes overproduction of ROS resulting in oxidative stress, the damage done by excessive exposure to these lights would also necessitate increased regenerative light exposure from the red- and near-infrared spectrum to balance it out, however, little red and no near-infrared is found in the LED spectrum.

Blue light exposure in the evening, which is common in the average household across the planet, is also responsible for suppressing melatonin production and increasing cortisol, ultimately confusing the biological day and night cycle, your circadian clock.

Melatonin is more than just the hormone instigated by your ganglion cells in your retina and produced in the pineal gland to help you sleep at night.

It is also a free radical scavenger, an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory and a circadian modulator, among other thing.

Exposure to artificial light sources after the sun has set is linked to a variety of disorders and pathologies including breast cancer, neurological, psychiatric and metabolic disorders.

Researchers have even found that circadian disruption may cause structural changes to the brain, affect moods, decrease neurogenesis, cause impairments in learning and memory and even increase depression.

Interestingly, while white and blue light had a marked negative effect on the hippocampal region of the brain, red light had very little effect, making it a non-threatening light source.

According to Dr. Alexander Wunsch, a respected expert in the field of photobiology, clear incandescent bulbs are preferred for indoor lighting over the newer LEDs as they have a color rendering index equivalent to the sun’s, which is 100, and a color temperature that rarely exceeds 3000 kelvin(k).

By comparison, the sun is at 5,500 kelvin at its center, and natural light is approximately 2700 kelvin, LEDs on the other hand can run as high as 6,500 kelvin, without the thermal component, making them higher in color temperature than the sun, yet deceivingly clear and inviting.

The influence of light over our biology is unquestionable, yet the study into the extent and depth of that influence is still in its infancy.

Humans have adapted and thrived since the beginning of humanity beneath the watchful rays of the sun. Ancestrally we rose with the dawn and we slept when darkness fell, our only light, that of the moon, the stars and perhaps a glowing fire.

With fire lights CRI of 100 and a color temperature of 1900, this glow doesn’t affect the natural rise and fall of melatonin, and thus our biological clocks were set by the native rhythms of full spectrum light and the changing seasons which we were intimately connected to all year-round.

Modern life has given us undeniable advantages and innovations, but in the midst of this lies an unfortunate loss, with the severing of our connection to the natural rhythms and while we may be unconscious of the impact of this loss, our cells and our physiology are definitely not.

While this branch of science necessitates mature solutions such as blackout curtains, street lights whose design points its light towards the night sky to prevent leakage of light, LEDs which adjust their wavelength to mimic the progression of the daylight and shift into red after dark, and even glasses that use amber lenses to block the more harmful blue rays from indoor lighting and electronics, will more and more be used to negate damage being done through our constant exposure to light pollution?

For now, perhaps the easiest and best place to start with resetting your circadian clock and increasing your mitochondria’s ATP potential is to get out in the early morning sun for a good half hour to an hour, put your feet on the ground around noon and step out into the rays of the UVB rich light and let your body absorb and create plenty of Vitamin D, and then when night falls, put on your blue blocking glasses or eat by candle light and read a book rather than stare at an electronic blue back-lit device.

How Our Family has Benefited from Changes in our Routine

While researching this subject, I found myself compelled to make rather large changes in my daily routine, and that of my children.

Understandably, they were not terribly excited when I woke them up at dark o’clock to witness the sun’s triumphant return. But with bare feet pressed into the earth beneath their deck chairs, they silently watched the sun peek through the trees and eventually reveal herself completely.

The birds who arrived for their morning worms were as confused as the children by our presence in the yard and watched us suspiciously from the branches above.

But an odd thing happened over the course of the first week, we became addicted to this early morning rise and setting an alarm soon became unnecessary. After a few days, the birds and the squirrels showed up to greet us each morning and became so bold as to practically pull up a chair next to us.

I made it a point to do the majority of my work and the children’s work outside in the yard or on our porch in order to be exposed to natural light for the majority of the day, and we also decided to eat by candlelight each night and use red light before bed to help prevent the suppression of our natural melatonin wherever possible.

As a result, we found that we all are sleeping better, have much more mental energy and are overall feeling far more relaxed, even in the midst of this pandemic.

Perhaps, the most life-changing thing you can do right now, given the circumstances, would be to go outside and reset your internal clock, soak up (responsibly) some UVB and infrared rays to boost your immune system and turn off your LEDs after the sun goes down.

SUMMARY: White House forecaster thinks Americans will just stop dying. Trump bars pandemic task-force members from talking to Congress. US is facing a new, more dangerous coronavirus mutation. How much will we pay for a vaccine? We need a national plan, not local plans. The 1918-19 flu caused a surge of right-wing extremism. The Big 3.

Key forecasts for coronavirus deaths are rising as states reopen. Meanwhile, a White House forecaster thinks people are just going to stop dying.

Coronavirus-related deaths in the United States are nearing 70,000.

On Monday, as Insider's Sinead Baker reports, researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington nearly doubled their US death forecast to 134,000 by early August, with more deaths expected thereafter.

The IHME increased the death forecast because the epidemic peak in the US is lasting longer than expected and new cases are declining more slowly than expected.

As Insider's Eliza Relman reported on Monday, another forecasting model, featured in a government ""situation update,"" assumes a radical acceleration in daily new cases and deaths by the end of this month.

US Department of Homeland Security presentation, via New York Times

This latter forecast was apparently preliminary, and the White House and CDC have since disavowed it. But the researcher from Johns Hopkins who put it together told The Washington Post that ""there are reopening scenarios where it could get out of control very quickly.""

Meanwhile, the White House's own model is decidedly more optimistic.

The Post reports that economist and Trump adviser Kevin Hassett has developed a model that predicts coronavirus deaths will drop sharply this month and ""essentially go to zero"" by May 15. Here's his ""cubic fit"" model overlaid with the other models.

No one knows the future. Everyone is free to come up with their own forecasts. But some forecasts have more logic supporting them than others.

And the White House's, meanwhile, seems more like a dream. — HB

The White House has barred 'Coronavirus Task Force' experts from speaking to Congress

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and President Donald Trump during a briefing on the coronavirus at the National Institutes of Health, March 3, 2020, in Bethesda, Maryland. AP

The Trump administration this week squashed two efforts to start a broader conversation about its coronavirus response.

The White House barred the members of its pandemic task force from testifying to Congress, effectively preventing the legislative branch from asking any questions of the executive branch about the most significant global catastrophe since World War II. The White House claims it wants to keep task-force members from being distracted.

On the same day, the administration skipped a global vaccine summit designed to raise billions for research, rally public support, and start the conversation about how to collaborate globally on manufacturing and distribution.

What did the administration not skip? Self-promotion. It arranged for a friendly Fox News interview of the president inside the Lincoln Memorial, an unprecedented use of that sacred civic space.

This is a demoralizing trend: The Trump administration enthusiastically seeks any opportunity for self-promotion and aggrandizement of its COVID-19 response, any occasion when it can claim success.

But the coronavirus crisis is not a problem solved by mere claims, by the rhetorical energy the president specializes in. Solving it requires constant effort, improvement, revision, cooperation, clarity, and transparency. If the administration refuses to answer hard questions, listen to Congress, or even collaborate with allies, we'll continue to lag the world in stopping the pandemic. —DP

A study shows coronavirus may have mutated

An early draft of a study from researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory — which has not been published or peer-reviewed yet — suggests that the coronavirus mutated over the past few months. They concluded that the strain of the virus that has afflicted most people in the US is the newer version.

The researchers have not yet figured out whether one strain is significantly different or more harmful than another. If a virus mutates enough, it could have implications for treatments and vaccines, but researchers so far think the new coronavirus mutates at a very slow rate, which is promising.

In previous epidemics, such as the devastating ""Great Influenza"" of 1918-19, a second strain of the virus — the one that wiped out most of the estimated 39 million people who died — was more deadly than the first.

The challenge for vaccines, meanwhile, is that if a virus mutates a vaccine that works for one strain might not work for another.

The researchers' draft study itself is here, but it's dense. —HB

How much will a COVID-19 vaccine cost? Way way way way less than it's worth

COVID-19 vaccine trials are starting at an encouraging clip. Insider's Andrew Dunn reports on a new Pfizer one today.

But the high stakes and enormous costs of accelerating research have raised fears that a COVID-19 vaccine will be too expensive, and that whatever company makes it will score windfall profits.

Since there's not yet a vaccine, it's too early to answer the pricing and profit questions. But surveys I've seen, including this Insider story, suggest a possible cost of about $10 per dose when manufacturing gets scaled up. Here are a few key things to remember about that vaccine, when it does arrive:

It will need to be made available worldwide. There will be monumental pressure on the manufacturer and the nation that made it to license it globally. And if they don't license it, it will be pirated. It's too valuable for any country to go without it.

It will get cheaper as we learn how to make and distribute it better.

The company that makes it will earn billions in profits, even if their original research was funded by a government.

Most important, however much the vaccine costs, however huge the windfall profits to the manufacturer, it will be worth it.

Conservative estimates suggest COVID-19 will slash $3 trillion from global economic output in 2020. That's $375 per person this year alone. It will inflict trillions and trillions more damage in years to come.

If a vaccine ended up costing $100 per dose (and it definitely won't be that pricey), and we spent $780 billion to vaccinate everyone on earth, it would still be the bargain of the century. —DP

We need national leadership and a national plan

Many states in the US are beginning to reopen. Their eagerness is understandable: The pandemic and lockdowns are having a devastating effect on our economy, jobs, and lives, and we're desperate to get back to normal. And with warmer weather outside, and declining cases in some areas, patience is nearing its end.

The problem is that this initial phase of our national coronavirus-attack plan — mitigation — did not go as well as planned.

Nationwide, new cases and deaths per day have flattened (good), but they have not yet meaningfully declined (bad). Excluding the tristate area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, in fact, US cases per day are continuing to rise.

Two caveats to this. First, the economist Ian Shepardson points out that most of the increase outside of the tristate area is coming from only seven states. A trailing average of cases in 40 of 50 US states, he says, are now declining.

Second, the steady (and important) increase in US testing capacity may account for some of this increase in confirmed cases. But it probably doesn't account for all of it.

Most important, we still don't have a plan for the next phase or a leader to bring us together and lead us through it.

State and local governments do have a critical role to play. Each county, state, and region is facing a different situation, and each needs to approach their situation differently.

But US states and cities are not separate countries. US citizens — at least in normal times — travel freely from one state and city to another. Even if each state and city were capable of eliminating the virus on its own, traveling Americans would continually bring the virus with them.

If we want to get back to normal, therefore, we need a national approach, not just a state and local approach. The federal government can't just be a ""backup,"" as the Trump administration has recently been saying.

The federal government needs to lead. And the federal government needs a plan.

What do we need in this federal plan?

Mostly, funding. Funding for the states. Funding for testing. Funding for contact tracing. Funding for isolation and quarantine facilities.

But also leadership.

We need our federal government to use its resources and expertise to develop, communicate, coordinate, and execute a national and then global plan. We need regular updates from relevant experts on how the plan is going and how we're changing it as the circumstances change.

That's what our federal government is there for, after all. That's what we built it and pay it to do.

And yet, even as the country opens back up, it is clear that our federal government has no real plan. Instead, our federal government appears to be leaving the problem to someone else. —HB

Will COVID-19 lead to a rise in political extremism?

German cities with higher mortality from the 1918-19 flu voted more heavily for the Nazis in 1932-33, a New York Federal Reserve researcher concludes in a new paper.

Even after controlling for other factors including income, religion, and ethnic makeup, flu deaths corresponded to a rise in right-wing extremism 14 years later. (Though not to a rise in left-wing extremism. Voting for the communist party was unaffected.)

Will COVID-19 cause a similar extremist surge in hard-hit countries? —DP

1248,1249,1634,Hillary Steamrolls Trump With Fact Check Of Vote By Mail Lies,"There is a disturbing core of Donald Trump voters who talk about him as if he is God’s chosen one and follow him with the fervor of a Jim Jones tribe before they drank the Kool-Aid. Their dislike of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has not softened even a little in the four years since she ran against him. Certainly, she turns off others for a variety of reasons, but when she strikes back at Trump, it really hurts.

Thursday, Clinton pointed her rapier wit at the president for being hypocritical, lying, and threatening. She noted that he voted by mail, too:

‘Trump himself votes by mail but is spreading lies and making threats to prevent his fellow Americans from pursuing the same option during an epidemic. It’s clear we’ll have to work to protect safe access to the ballot box this fall.’

The thing is that all of the president’s men have told him Republicans only win when they manage to limit the number of people who can vote. If people can vote by mail, say during a coronavirus pandemic, they will vote him out of office.

Clinton is right when she said “we’ll have to work to protect safe access to the ballot box.” It is hard to shut down a voting location when the vote goes by mail. A number of states already have full access to voting by mail, and that may be one reason POTUS has been trying to take down the post office. Never mind that American veterans get all of their medications through the mail.

There will be other ways that Trump tries to limit people’s Constitutional right to vote.

Twitter world went nuts at Clinton getting under Trump’s skin — both pro and con. Check out some of their responses below:

37,37,70,Q&A: Can I go outside? Should I get an antibody test? Plus other coronavirus questions answered.,"Is it safe for me to go outside?

For most people, absolutely, experts say. The outdoors may preserve your sanity — and save social distancing.

“If we don’t encourage people to get outside, we will have a widespread social insurrection,” said Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “People are already challenged by the isolation imposed by social distancing.”



Experts say that if you maintain a six-foot distance from other people, you should be even safer outside than in a closed area.



When outdoors, “you don’t have to stay six feet away from your spouse or child,” said Maria Raven, chief of emergency medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. “But if you are meeting a friend for a hike or going to the grocery store, keep your distance.”

Dog walking is a good activity — as long as you don’t let your pet get too close to other dogs or other people. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is no indication pets play a significant role in transmitting the virus, it recommends you treat them like family members, keeping them away from animals and people not in your household. Duke University researchers recently reported that Winston, a pug in North Carolina, tested positive for the virus — the first reported canine case in the United States. But the results still need to be confirmed.



If you are a senior citizen or someone who is chronically ill or has a suppressed immune system, see if you can get prescriptions and groceries delivered, or send a younger relative to pick them up.



If I’m older, do I have to stay inside all the time?

It’s hard to generalize, Marrazzo said, because “some 70-year-olds run marathons, so you can’t make a blanket statement about people’s risks.” But conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and diabetes raise people’s risks of becoming severely ill or dying of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. And even healthy seniors, she said, “don’t get a complete pass” on increased risk. The bottom line: All seniors should take extra care.



What about masks? Should I wear one?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that face coverings be worn in public places to slow spread of the virus, a reversal of previous recommendations.

The CDC’s website says the agency recommends the coverings for “public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g. grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”



Some businesses do not allow customers to enter without wearing masks.

The recommendation was announced in early April by President Trump, who stressed that the guidance was voluntary and said he wasn’t planning to wear a mask. The guidance was issued after a vigorous debate within the administration. Some officials wanted the recommendation targeted primarily to locales that are being especially affected by the virus.



But health officials argued that universal masking was necessary, pointing to new data showing that a high proportion of infected people may not exhibit symptoms, even as they spread the virus by emitting droplets when they talk, sneeze or even exhale. A mask — or some kind of cloth face covering, such as a bandanna or scarf — keeps those people from infecting others, they say.



Health officials made clear that the public should avoid using the kind of gear — N95 respirators or surgical masks — that is in short supply and desperately needed by health workers.

What do I do if my significant other gets sick?

It depends. If you have been with the person day and night for several days, you may already be exposed. Still, you can’t know for sure, and doctors say it’s wise to err on the side of caution and distance yourself as much as possible.



Most cases of covid-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, and a spouse probably will be able to take care of himself or herself. If possible, the ill spouse should move into an extra bedroom, use a different bathroom and wear a mask to protect others in the household.

If you are living with someone who needs help, you should wear a mask and gloves while providing care. If you are removing a dinner plate, for example, grab it with a dishrag or wear gloves, doctors say.



Even at a distance, however, it’s important to monitor a person with covid-19. Doctors are finding that covid-19 can apparently raise the risks of blood clots, strokes and other serious conditions that require immediate medical care.



What are the symptoms of covid-19?

A few months into the crisis, we know the disease has a far wider range of symptoms than initially thought. In addition to fever, coughing, shortness of breath and other flu-like symptoms, doctors are seeing gastrointestinal problems — nausea and vomiting, for example — chest pain and a loss of smell. Some doctors report brain inflammation and pinkeye in patients. It’s not clear, physicians say, whether the varied symptoms are caused by covid-19 or just occurring at the same time.

The CDC recently added several new symptoms to its list for the coronavirus, including chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and loss of taste and smell. The symptoms could appear two to 14 days after infection, the agency said.





What do I do if I think I’m infected?

Consult your primary care doctor, if you have one. Don’t go to the physician’s office or the emergency room without calling ahead. The coronavirus is highly contagious, and doctors want to protect themselves and other patients from infection. You’ll probably be advised to self-quarantine and, because there is no effective treatment for the disease, take over-the-counter pain medicines such as Tylenol.

If symptoms worsen, and you have trouble breathing or have underlying medical conditions, seek immediate medical care.

Will I be tested for the virus?

It depends on where you live and even what hospital or health system you use. After a sluggish start, diagnostic testing is ramping up in many parts of the country, helped by the entry of commercial labs and the approval of rapid tests by the Food and Drug Administration.





But in some states, laboratories are still overwhelmed by the demand and struggling with shortages of critical items, including chemical components needed to run the tests.

Governors, congressional leaders and public health officials have pressed for a robust testing plan from the federal government, insisting that frequent and widespread testing is crucial to ending the stay-at-home orders that have idled businesses in much of the country. But a “blueprint” presented Monday by Trump leaves the onus on states to develop their own plans and rapid-response programs.

The United States has run more tests than any other country but trails many nations in per capita testing.

What about home tests?

The FDA has not approved any tests in which the entire process — collection of nasal specimen, followed by processing and result — occur at home. But it did give emergency authorization for a test that allows patients to collect nasal samples at home. The idea is for consumers to go online and fill out a questionnaire with LabCorp, a North Carolina company. If they meet CDC guidelines for testing, they’ll be sent the Pixel kit that includes swabs and saline. Once patients collect the specimens, they can mail them to a LabCorp lab for processing.



LabCorp said it would initially make the test available only to health-care workers and emergency workers showing covid-19 symptoms. The company plans to make the test available to consumers in coming weeks. Allowing people to self-swab reduces the risk of transmitting the virus to others and the need for personal protective equipment, because health-care providers are not involved in sample collection, the company said.

What about antibody tests?

One of the hottest topics now is serology tests, designed to detect whether you have been exposed to the virus and have antibodies that may help show whether you have immunity to the illness. They are not designed to detect active infections.

Dozens of antibody tests are on the market, but the FDA has authorized fewer than 10. The agency has taken a hands-off approach, allowing companies to sell the test after notifying the FDA and saying the tests have been validated. At the same time, the agency and testing experts have warned that some of the tests are being marketed fraudulently and are of dubious quality. The government is trying to validate the unvetted tests, but it is unclear when the data will be available.

Even authorized tests have come in for scrutiny. Some government and business officials tout them as a way to reopen the economy by identifying people who can safely return to work. But many scientists, as well as the World Health Organization, say evidence is lacking that even high-quality antibody tests can prove someone who was infected has immunity from the novel coronavirus and is not at risk of being reinfected.

When will this end?

No one knows, though experts say the social distancing practiced by many Americans has prevented the pandemic from being worse. It isn’t clear how the arrival of summer’s warmer weather will affect the virus.

The White House is finalizing expanded guidelines to allow the phased reopening of schools and camps, child-care programs, certain workplaces, houses of worship, restaurants and mass transit, according to documents under review by administration officials.

Several states are lifting, or considering lifting, strict stay-at-home orders to allow some businesses to reopen. Colorado, Georgia and Texas are among those pressing ahead. Even New York, which was hit especially hard, is exploring a loosening of the rules. But public health officials warn state leaders to proceed carefully and to be prepared to reinstate tough regulations if the number of virus cases surges. Experts say any successful reopening strategy must be accompanied by additional testing and contact tracing to quickly find and isolate people who contract the virus.

Even after Americans emerge from their isolation, chances are good we will have to maintain some measures — isolating the infected, regular hand-washing, some degree of social distancing — until viable treatments and vaccines are developed, which could take months or years.

283,283,363,Baseball without fans sounds doable. Baseball without COVID-19 sounds hard to believe.,"Everyone needs hope, especially now, even if it’s a tiny dot of light at the end of a long tunnel. I don’t know if sports can provide that, but it can provide a sliver of normalcy, and that’s what most of us want right now. We’d like as close to normal as we can get, as fast as we can get it.

So baseball games without fans in the seats? Yes, please. No runs, no hits, no errors and nobody in the stands? No problem. It would be strange for a while, then we’d get used to it.

But a dose of reality: Does anyone really believe a season could be played without players getting infected with the coronavirus? And does anybody really believe the season wouldn’t be shut down at the first hint of a positive test?

Major League Baseball is considering a plan in which its 30 teams would compete at spring-training sites in the Phoenix area, as well as at the Diamondbacks’ ballpark, possibly as soon as May. Players, coaches and essential personnel would live in hotels away from their families.

If there’s a more miserable existence than being isolated with 25 major-league ballplayers for five months, it has yet to be invented. I know: You’d sequester yourself with 25 telemarketers if it meant millions of dollars in your bank account. But in the case of ballplayers, that’s a lot of video games, ornery personalities, hunting stories and pent-up, um, urges. If Phoenix-area bars were to open during the season, would you trust a libidinous teammate to continue watching reruns of “Baywatch”? And how soon before he brings COVID-19 to the clubhouse?

To rally the troops for ninth-inning comebacks, managers like to say, “All it takes is one.’’ One hit to turn the tide. And all it takes is one positive test to shut down the season again.

I want this to work. I find it hard to believe it can.

Players take infield practice before each game, touching baseballs that have been in the hand of the coach hitting to them. The players throw those baseballs to a first baseman, who also touches them. It’s a germfest out there. A pitcher and catcher touch the same ball often during the game. A batboy delivers balls to the umpire several times over nine innings. Et cetera.

And spitting! It’s what baseball players do between breaths. They spit saliva, they spit sunflower seeds and some still spit tobacco. They spit when they wake up, and they spit when they go to bed. It’s reasonable to expect that they’ll spit wherever they sit during games. It’s reasonable to expect that teammates will step on those expectorations, spreading whatever there is to be spread.

Little things we take for granted will come with question marks. The big things — one player sliding into another, trading sweat — seem like major stumbling blocks. I’m assuming teammates will be sharing clubhouse washrooms, showers and weight rooms. Who will be cleaning players’ hotel rooms? Serving food to them? Hard to believe those people will be cloistered from their families, too.

(I’m not worried about mound visits. Players have been talking through their gloves for years. It’s baseball’s version of N95 masks.)

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it’s possible for pro sports to return in 2020.

“There’s a way of doing that,” he said on “Good Luck America,” an interview series from Snapchat. “(No fans come) to the stadium. Put (the players) in big hotels wherever you want to play. Keep them very well-surveilled and have them tested, like every week, and make sure they don’t wind up infecting each other or their family and just let them play the season out.”

Scientists in China have found that people infected with COVID-19 likely are spreading the disease for up to 2½ days before showing symptoms. Or, as the Los Angeles Times puts it, “an infected person can walk around feeling fine for more than two full days while spewing virus into the air, depositing it onto doorknobs and handrails, and sowing the seeds for future infections.’’

Play ball!

This brings us to the feeling of being stuck, which is one of the dark byproducts of the coronavirus. We can’t live our lives in the fear of something bad happening, but what if the odds are decent that something bad will indeed happen? Should we carry on anyway? Or should we wait for a vaccine, which might not be available for a year?

The nation is facing the same questions. When do we reopen society? Is there ever a point where the health of the economy is as important as the health of the citizenry?

Sports are being presented as a national balm to help us get through the pandemic. We know it’s really about the billions of TV dollars, but we don’t care. We want baseball back.

But how long can it last? Or, asked another way, anyone up for Esports?",1

But nothing about the venture was right, from the workers’ failure to change gloves between customers to a bogus claim on a sign that the operation was approved by “HIPPA,” a misspelled acronym for the federal law that restricts how health data can be shared.
Instead, said David James, the president of the Louisville Metro Council, it was a flagrant attempt to con panicked citizens into handing over their money, along with social security numbers and credit card information that could be used for identity theft.
“It was ridiculous,” Mr. James said. He estimated that more than 100 people were deceived before the leaders of the apparently fake testers threw their supplies into the back of a truck and fled north up the highway.
Federal, state and local law enforcement authorities are reporting an explosion of such scams as fraudsters move to capitalize on public panic over the fast-moving pandemic and the flood of federal money making its way to most Americans to help address the economic fallout.
“We are seeing fraud across the board, everything from low-tech to very sophisticated schemes,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The pandemic has affected so many people in so many different ways, he said, that “it just allows the fraudsters to have their buffet, as it were, to prey upon vulnerable people.”
Seeking to stay ahead of the curve, the Justice Department has set up a task force to investigate price-gouging and prosecutors have been instructed to prioritize fraud cases. With more than $2 trillion in federal assistance pouring into the economy, the authorities are girding for both lone wolf operations and more complicated schemes akin to those that arose during the 2008 federal program to bail out financial institutions.
Other agencies have followed suit. The Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to more than 15 companies peddling unproven treatments or diagnostic tests. State attorneys general are fighting the same practices by issuing cease-and-desist orders.
The Environmental Protection Agency has threatened legal action against retailers that sell unregistered disinfectants and sanitizers that falsely claim to protect against the virus. And the Federal Trade Commission reported Tuesday that the number of coronavirus-related complaints it had received from consumers this year had doubled during the previous week, reaching more than 7,800.
“Scams follow the headlines, and that’s certainly the case with this,” said Monica Vaca, a consumer protection lawyer for the agency.
Last month, Dr. Alexander G. Salerno, an internist in East Orange, N.J., was desperately searching for personal protective equipment for his fellow medical workers. “It is like trying to find spare change in your couch,” he said.
His regular suppliers were out, but through similarly hard-pressed medical providers commiserating in a WhatsApp group chat, he was able to contact several sellers. A man who never revealed his name to Dr. Salerno — and who the authorities later said was operating out of an auto body shop — agreed to sell him 3,000 surgical masks and 2,800 sterile gowns for $12,000, a markup of about 700 percent. Dr. Salerno wired the money to a bank account.
When he went to pick up some of the supplies on March 18, he said, the man led him to a warehouse packed with enough medical equipment to outfit an entire hospital.
Inside, he saw pallet upon pallet of N95 protective masks, surgical gowns, Clorox wipes and hand sanitizers. “He had everything, right from the factory, certified real stuff,” Dr. Salerno said.
The doctor said he tried and failed to alert the state attorney general’s office. But the morning after a local television station aired a story about his experience, F.B.I. agents appeared at his office.
“We jumped all over it,” said Craig Carpenito, the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey who leads the task force from Newark. “It’s outrageous. If I was married to, or if I was a health care professional, I would be horrified right now that I can’t get the simple equipment I need for protection.”
The seller, Baruch Feldheim of Brooklyn, ran a company called “Solo Supplies” that had compiled a vast stockpile on the open market, including from a source in Canada, of 192,000 N95 masks, 598,000 pairs of surgical gloves and 130,000 other items like surgical masks, the authorities said.
Mr. Feldheim was arrested on Monday and charged with false statements and — because agents said he deliberately coughed in their direction and said he was sick with the virus — assaulting a federal officer. Asked why he was not charged with the crime of hoarding essential materials, authorities said that the investigation was continuing.
Using its authority under the Defense Production Act, the federal government bought Mr. Feldheim’s entire inventory — at standard prices — and shipped it to hard-pressed medical workers in New York and New Jersey.
“It’s just about the most un-American thing that I have encountered in my life,” Mr. Carpenito said. “People are out there looking to profit, despicably, from the greatest national crisis we have seen since World War II.”
The Newark case is one of a handful that federal prosecutors have brought over the past few weeks. In Austin, Texas, the F.B.I. shut down a website that promised consumers access to World Health Organization “vaccine kits” in exchange for a shipping charge of $4.95, payable by credit card. No vaccine for the virus exists.
In Georgia, F.B.I. agents arrested a 49-year-old man on charges of collecting kickbacks for Covid-19 tests and screenings for other respiratory illnesses in a scheme that aimed to submit $1.1 million in fraudulent Medicare claims. According to court documents, the man was upfront about his motives.
“Everybody has been chasing the Covid dollar bird,” he said in a telephone conversation, according to court papers. “While there are people going through what they are going through, you can either go bankrupt or you can prosper.”
That was apparently the view of another operator who promised a California union of nearly 100,000 health care workers that he could provide them 39 million N95 masks. But when health care providers like Kaiser Permanente sought to verify and inspect the man’s supply chain, he proved more and more elusive.
Last week, a federal prosecutor contacted the union, the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, for details about the seller. “As far as we know, no money changed hands,” said Steve Trossman, a spokesman for the union, which was trying to serve as an intermediary to hospitals. “The really bad thing was, the masks were desperately needed.”
In Southern California, agents arrested a 53-year-old, small-time actor for seeking investments in a nonexistent company that he claimed was just days away from marketing pills that would ward off the virus and injections that would cure Covid-19. The authorities said his YouTube and Instagram videos, in which he displayed a syringe of clear liquid or nondescript white pills, had been viewed more than two million times.
A self-described genius entrepreneur, the man claimed in a text to a cooperating witness that a Los Angeles patient stricken by Covid-19 rose from a sickbed and “walked out 51 hours after my injection,” the authorities said. He claimed he knew a doctor with White House ties who was on his way to President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for an emergency order authorizing his drugs and promised a $300,000 investment in his company would yield a $30 million return.
Law enforcement officials are warning consumers to be especially wary of cyberscams, including sophisticated emails claiming to be from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Red Cross or other health organizations. One study suggested 3 percent of coronavirus-related domain names registered since January were malicious, while another 5 percent were suspicious. State attorneys general, like Letitia James of New York, have been warning companies that register domain names to be more vigilant.
Such frauds are only expected to multiply as the federal government doles out financial aid to individuals and businesses as part of the $2.2 trillion stimulus package.
Twelve years later, federal investigators are still pursuing bad actors who misused the $475 billion federal program intended to bail out banks and financial institutions after the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008. More than 400 people have been prosecuted, including 76 bankers who went to prison.",1
19,19,45,NASA center in California issues mandatory work-from-home policy after employee tests positive for COVID-19,"One of NASA’s research centers in California has issued a mandatory telework policy after one of its employees tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The move is temporary for now, coming just a few days after NASA’s centers throughout the country tested out their work-from-home capabilities during a voluntary telework day on Friday.

On Sunday, NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, California, announced it was restricting access to its facilities. Engineers and scientists at Ames play roles in many of NASA’s major programs, focusing on areas like supercomputing, artificial intelligence, air traffic management, and more. The center is also home to immense wind tunnels that help test both aircraft and vehicles bound for space.

“We believe the exposure at the center has been limited.”

In its telework announcement, Ames Research Center noted that more updates would follow for employees who work in the labs and facilities on site. “We believe the exposure at the center has been limited, but — out of an abundance of caution, and in consultation with NASA Headquarters and the NASA Chief Heath and Medical Officer in accordance to agency response plans — Ames Research Center will temporarily go to a mandatory telework status until further notice,” the center said in a statement.

Employees have long had telework capabilities at NASA, but as the novel coronavirus outbreak spreads throughout the US, the space agency wanted to do a wide-scale test of its telework capabilities last week. NASA employees were encouraged to bring their laptops and badges home on Friday, March 6th.

“The purpose of this exercise is to test our capabilities, resources, and preparedness for large-scale teleworking,” Steve Jurczyk, NASA’s associate administrator, wrote in an email last week. “I encourage civil servants and onsite contractors who are telework eligible to participate by working from an alternate location Friday.” Jurczyk also told employees that they should start taking their laptops and other important work items home daily in case the outbreak progresses further in the coming weeks and days.

“Your continued support helps us remain vigilant if the situation requires additional actions,” Jurczyk wrote.",1
957,957,1150,German soccer's Bundesliga gets underway after coronavirus shutdown – with noticeable changes,"Millions of sports fans will be watching their first live game in months when Germany's Bundesliga plays its opening game on Saturday. As the first major sports league in the world to return during the coronavirus pandemic, some hope it could provide a roadmap for the U.S.' major leagues – the NFL, NBA, MLB and others.

""Every little thing about what Germany has done should be watched very closely by U.S. sports,"" Grant Wahl, a leading soccer journalist and author of ""Masters of Modern Soccer,"" told CBS News' Roxana Saberi.

Many Bundesliga teams resumed training in April after regular games were sidelined in March over COVID-19 and players were sent into quarantine.

One team, Dynamo Dresden, has already had to delay its start after two players tested positive for the virus and forced the entire team into a 14-day lockdown.

The return to the pitch will have some noticeable changes, starting with teams' entrances. A single team will have to ride in on multiple busses to observe social distancing rules.

At games, coaches and substitutes not in play will have to wear face masks.

Players on the field have been told they can make physical contact as part of the game, but the hugging and celebratory embraces that come with scoring a goal are no longer allowed.

""We have to think about this, what we could do, because sometimes automatically you go to your teammate to celebrate the goal,"" Robert Lewandowski, striker for Bundesliga's Bayern Munich team, said.

The stands will also be noticeably quiet, with live fans banned for the rest of the season. Some will be paying to have cardboard cutouts of themselves sitting in stadiums instead.

""We of course will miss spectators, and therefore of course it's important, but it's not the time for wishes and dreams,"" said Carsten Cramer, managing director of the team Borussia Dortmund.

Although soccer fans may be excited, opinions in Germany are split. As the country eases its strict pandemic lockdown, a recent poll suggests just over half of respondents oppose the return of soccer matches.",1
859,859,1030,Why unemployment fueled by pandemic is hitting women harder than men,"The joblessness crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has dealt an unprecedented blow to women in the workforce, hitting women of color particularly hard. Just over 15% of women in the U.S. lost their jobs in April, compared to 13% of men — the first time an economic spiral has affected women, who were making big job gains until the crisis, worse than men.

""I worked… my son went to school, and all that's changed since the virus,"" Missouri mom Meghan Hiles told CBS News' consumer investigative correspondent Anna Werner.

Hiles worked as a massage therapist until she was furloughed on March 14. She said the spa she works for reopens June 1, but she worries for her and her 11-year-old son's health, because they both have asthma.

Hiles is also concerned for her stepmother, who has COPD and is her primary child care provider.

""If something were to happen to my stepmom, as in, I go in and I work on somebody, come to pick him up, and come over there and give something to her — if she died, I would feel terrible,"" she said.

More than 36 million Americans lost their jobs since the pandemic began. Experts say women have born the brunt of job losses because the industries that were hardest hit are ""hugely dominated by women"": leisure and hospitality, retail, education and health services.

""Think about who teaches, you know, grade school kids? Who works at a daycare center? Health care, who typically works in a doctor's office?"" economist Diane Lim, with the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said.

National Women's Law Center President and CEO Fatima Goss Graves said the crisis ""basically wiped out the job gains that women, and particularly black women, had since the last recession.""

The center ran an analysis that found roughly one in six black women and one in five Latino women are now unemployed.

""We don't know what the other side of this is going to look like,"" Goss Graves said.

New Jersey resident Simone Bailey found herself temporarily laid off from one of her hotel restaurant jobs. Her other new, full-time job was completely eliminated.

""We got called into the office and they let us know that we are laid off. Not even furloughed, just laid off,"" Bailey said.

The mother of two said the job losses left her feeling ""very displaced,"" and she has spent her time sewing face masks instead.

Bailey said her state unemployment check is just under $300 per week, and the extra federal money she was receiving only came for three weeks.

""I still don't see how I'm supposed to live,"" she said. ""And everybody else that I've worked with, all the other women that I was working with, it's the same thing.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP

President Trump has drawn repeated comparisons between the novel coronavirus outbreak and the flu season.

""We have a lot of people dying from the flu on top of everything else,"" he said Monday. ""It's very bad. It looks like it could be over 50,000.""

The reality so far for the current flu season is still emerging. There have been at least 23,000 deaths from flu during the 2019-2020 season, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The upper range of the estimate for deaths is 59,000.

The CDC estimates there have been at least 38 million flu illnesses and 390,000 hospitalizations.

The CDC estimates are based on weekly surveillance data and are preliminary.

The rates of hospitalization for flu ""remain moderate"" overall, according to the CDC. But some age groups have experienced higher hospitalization rates than usual. Flu hospitalizations are ""the highest CDC has on record"" for young children, up to age 4, and adults ages, 18-49.

While the flu can send hundreds of thousands of people to the hospital each year, the seasonal effect is reasonably well understood and planned for. The comparison between flu and COVID-19 doesn't capture the strain that the new coronavirus is putting on hospitals.

COVID-19 is a new disease that is hard to predict. And the surge in cases requiring intensive care that was seen in China and now in Italy can lead to a health system's collapse, health officials have said.",1

1104,1104,1330,The Pandemic’s Geopolitical Aftershocks Are Coming,"Read: Our democracy will survive this pandemic

History, as Barack Obama said of American progress, zigs and zags. Great changes set off chain reactions: The Wall Street Crash of 1929 ushered in the New Deal era; Allied victory in 1945 created the conditions for the Cold War. Each event creates political aftershocks and trends that we can see clearly only afterward. The decade that followed the 2008 financial crisis saw the euro zone teeter on the brink of collapse, Britain vote to leave the European Union, and Donald Trump elected president. Today, the global economy has suffered another sudden seizure, shifting geopolitics as U.S.-China tensions have risen, trade has slowed markedly, and structural divisions between northern and southern Europe have widened. The question, then, is what might happen in the decade after this crisis?

“Historians love chapter breaks,” said Robert Kaplan, an American foreign-policy expert and former member of the U.S. Defense Policy Board, who this month briefed officials at 10 Downing Street on the potential second-order effects of the coronavirus crisis. “COVID-19 will come to be seen as a chapter break.”

Among Kaplan’s concerns is how Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin, will act, a fear echoed by some of the most influential voices in British foreign policy, who worry that the geopolitical second wave of COVID-19 will hit Europe the hardest. Michael Clarke, a defense-studies professor at King’s College London and former special adviser to Britain’s national committee on security strategy, who remains plugged in to the country’s foreign-policy establishment, told me that an economically weakened Russia, hit by the recent collapse in oil prices, poses a greater danger to Western security interests. “Putin’s aggressive opportunism will probably get worse,” Clarke said. “The nature of Putin’s leadership is that he can’t stand still; he has to keep pushing forward. This makes him more volatile.” What happens if the Russian leader, spooked by the country’s collapsing economy, eyes an opportunity to test NATO’s resolve? Others, such as Bruno Maçães, Portugal’s former Europe minister, told me that the crisis might not embolden Russia, but cripple it, leaving it more dependent on China and bringing Beijing’s sphere of influence to the borders of continental Europe. “Crises,” Kaplan noted, “put history on fast-forward.”

The array of possible second-wave consequences is dizzying: the prospect of the disease taking hold in a developing G20 country—think India—which could see the virus quickly doubling back to Europe and the U.S.; the uncertain impact of technological advances in fields such as artificial intelligence as they are used to help combat the disease’s spread; a recession pulling at the ties between the European Union’s poor south and wealthy north. Clarke is particularly concerned about an arc of instability from West Africa through the Middle East to Asia, where conflict and instability have in recent years forced people to flee. Karin von Hippel, the director general of the Royal United Services Institute, an influential British defense and international-affairs think tank, told me that “some kind of reckoning with China” is likely as well. “Some countries will emerge from this trying to cling to China … but most others are likely to try to decouple,” she said. For Britain, Germany, France, and other major European economies reliant on the American security umbrella but wanting to maintain strong economic ties with China, the difficulty of managing the fallout from the Trump administration’s anti-China rhetoric may now only increase.",1
1038,1038,1234,State and Federal Data on COVID-19 Testing Don’t Match Up,"The data sets have one known major difference: Some states report the total number of people tested, while the CDC reports every test, even if a single person is tested more than once. A spokesperson for Indiana’s public health department pointed to this difference to explain the state’s test gap. But our analysis suggests this—or any other methodological factor—does not fully explain the widespread discrepancies. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told us that one possible explanation is that the CDC could be overreporting testing totals in some states if it is including antibody-test results, which don’t track real-time infections, and underreporting in other states because of delays in paperwork. But the differences seem to be so widespread that they are unlikely to arise from a single discrepancy in how certain kinds of tests are reported. At their current rate of growth, Florida’s state-reported testing numbers would not match the CDC’s current totals for another two weeks.

“This is more evidence of the dysfunction of the CDC,” Jha said. “There is not supposed to be a lot of daylight between the CDC and the states.” Jha has previously criticized the CDC for being “inexplicably absent” during the coronavirus pandemic.

Some of the mismatch between states and the CDC could be explained by the federal government’s unusual manner of collecting testing data. Generally, disease-surveillance data flow from local public-health departments to state governments, and then on to the federal government. But in April, Vice President Mike Pence asked hospitals to start reporting their COVID-19 testing data directly to the federal government. In an email, a CDC spokesperson confirmed that the new website reflected test data from more sources than just states, saying it came from hospitals, private medical-testing companies, and state and local public-health labs.

Yascha Mounk: No testing, no treatment, no herd immunity, no easy way out

The data that Pence requested fed into a piece of software called HHS Protect, which was meant to serve as a clearinghouse of coronavirus data for the Trump administration, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS Protect was developed by the defense contractor Palantir. The company declined to comment on the record.

It’s unclear exactly when the CDC site first appeared. A CDC spokesperson told us that it went live on May 7, but the first Internet Archive cache of the page is dated May 9. The CDC did not announce the existence of the page in any statement, social-media post, or press conference.

In many of the counts the CDC did provide over the past several months, it missed the large majority of tests. In early May, the CDC reported that only about half a million tests had been conducted in the U.S. But the COVID Tracking Project had tallied the results of more than 7.5 million tests reported by states by then. In late April, the White House used the COVID Tracking Project’s data in a major report on national testing strategy. It cited the data again earlier this week in a press conference.

The CDC should provide the country with a single, trustworthy data source on the state of COVID-19 testing. But the fact that its data are still in such disagreement with the state-reported totals means that the CDC’s latest efforts are not of much use to politicians and the public. For now, the agency that should be a respected source of truth in this crisis is only adding to the national confusion.

3,3,4,Coronavirus disrupts the world: updates on the pandemic,"A new coronavirus appeared in Wuhan, China, at the start of December, and it has since infected millions of people all over the world. In March, the World Health Organization declared that the virus was a pandemic.

Coronaviruses are common in many types of animals and can sometimes jump to humans. In this case, the virus probably originally came from a bat. Two other coronaviruses have infected humans, causing outbreaks of SARS and MERS in 2002 and 2012, respectively.

The illness caused by the new coronavirus, COVID-19, appears to cause fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include loss of taste and smell and gastrointestinal problems. Some people never display symptoms but could still infect others. The illness appears to be severe in around a quarter of COVID-19 patients, and thousands of people have died from the disease in the US and around the world.

Public health officials are still trying to control raging outbreaks in many countries, and scientists are searching for treatments. As that work continues, businesses are shuttered, hospitals are struggling, and millions of people are staying quarantined for their safety and the safety of others.

1324,1327,1801,Trump administration might consolidate pandemic response at State Department,"The overall effort, first reported by the media platform Devex, is described as the President’s Response to Outbreaks, or PRO.

Under the proposed initiative, the State Department would appoint a coordinator to oversee nearly every aspect of pandemic preparedness and response — from the global distribution of vaccines and therapeutics to the development of modernized protocols to prevent the spread of an outbreak.

“Having a singular initiative to focus global attention and resources has been an effective model to turn the tide of diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria,” reads an outline of the new model that U.S. officials planned to circulate on Capitol Hill. “Through PRO the U.S. will assert global leadership for mobilizing private and public partners, multilateral institutions and other bilateral donors to support a global pandemic response that will deliver results for the American people.”

The proposal comes as senior administration officials grapple with ongoing flaws in the federal government’s response to Covid-19, which has pitted top agencies against each other as they work to secure medical supplies for U.S. stockpiles and other nations, and has often resulted in conflicting guidance from the White House and public health officials.

The plan could decrease USAID’s role by consolidating pandemic preparedness under the State Department, which lacks the volume of supply chain experts, epidemiologists and public health experts on staff at USAID. There also are questions about whether the initiative will focus strictly on infectious disease outbreaks or be expanded to include other types of global health issues.

One USAID official familiar with the proposal described it as a “power-grab” by the State Department. Another called it a “turf fight.”

The State Department declined to comment on “purportedly leaked deliberative documents.” A spokesperson for USAID declined to comment.

Some at USAID questioned whether now is an appropriate time to overhaul the existing response model given the ongoing coronavirus crisis. The number of pandemic-related deaths in the United States is nearing 100,000, and the Trump administration is shifting its focus to a swift reopening of the U.S. economy.

But, according to one USAID official, State Department leaders have been frustrated with USAID’s response to the novel coronavirus, feeling it’s been slow and not always aligned with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s priorities.

Members of the White House coronavirus task force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, also previously complained about USAID’s distribution of medical supplies to other countries at the height of the Covid-19 crisis, when U.S. hospitals and front-line workers faced shortages of personal protective equipment.

USAID is technically an independent agency, but it is supposed to take policy guidance from the secretary of State, whose department plays a role in USAID’s budget management.

“My read of it is they’re unhappy with USAID,” the USAID official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the topic. “USAID hasn’t been able to deliver on certain things.”

Documents circulated inside the administration were short on details about which programs at USAID could be relocated under the two components of PRO: America’s Response to Outbreaks, and the Preparedness Initiative for Pandemics and Emergency Response. It will differ from programs such as the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the President’s Malaria Initiative, but will incorporate lessons from them, according to an FAQ.

Aside from working on the coronavirus response, Birx — who could not immediately be reached for comment — holds titles including U.S. special representative for global health diplomacy. She’s been based at the State Department, and her duties include dealing with global HIV/AIDS programs, including PEPFAR.

“The goal at this stage is to develop a unified whole-of-government response and approach to pandemics that will allow us to bring together all of our government’s tools to meet the challenges we will face in this new era of pandemics,” one of the documents reads. “As the discussions progress towards implementation, we will clearly define specific roles and responsibilities across agencies, consistent with their mandates.”

According to the proposal, the ARO coordinator would work with government agencies and the private sector “to ensure the full power and expertise of the United States are leveraged to … prevent, detect, and respond to infectious diseases and mitigate and prepare for future disease outbreaks.”",1
1006,1006,1201,Obama criticizes U.S. leaders’ virus response in online graduation speech,"WASHINGTON — Former President Barack Obama on Saturday criticized U.S. leaders overseeing the nation’s response to the coronavirus, telling college graduates in an online commencement address that the pandemic shows many officials “aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”

Obama spoke on “Show Me Your Walk, HBCU Edition,” a two-hour event for students graduating from historically black colleges and universities broadcast on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. His remarks were unexpectedly political, given the venue, and touched on current events beyond the virus and its social and economic impacts.

“More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing,” Obama said. “A lot them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”

Later Saturday, during a second televised commencement address for high school seniors, Obama panned “so-called grown-ups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs” who do “what feels good, what’s convenient, what’s easy.”

“Which is why things are so screwed up,” he said.

Obama did not name President Donald Trump or any other federal or state officials in either of his appearances. But earlier this month, he harshly criticized Trump’s handling of the pandemic as an “absolute chaotic disaster” in a call with 3,000 members of his administrations obtained by Yahoo News.

The commencement remarks were the latest sign that Obama intends to play an increasingly active role in the coming election. He has generally kept a low profile in the years since he left office, even as Trump has disparaged him. Obama told supporters on the call that he would be “spending as much time as necessary and campaigning as hard as I can” for Joe Biden, who served as his vice president.

As he congratulated the college graduates Saturday and commiserated over the enormous challenges they face given the devastation and economic turmoil the virus has wrought, the former president noted the February shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, who was killed while jogging on a residential street in Georgia.

“Let’s be honest: A disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country,” Obama said. “We see it in the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on our communities, just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn’t submit to their questioning.”

“Injustice like this isn’t new,” Obama went on to say. “What is new is that so much of your generation has woken up to the fact that the status quo needs fixing, that the old ways of doing things don’t work.” In the face of a void in leadership, he said, it would be up to the graduates to shape the future.

“If the world’s going to get better, it’s going to be up to you,” he said.

It is a perilous time for the nation’s historically black colleges and universities, which have long struggled with less funding and smaller endowments than their predominantly white peers and are now dealing with the financial challenges of the coronavirus. Even at the better-endowed HBCUs, officials are bracing for a tough few years.

Obama’s message to high school students came at the end of an hourlong television special featuring celebrities, including LeBron James, Yara Shahidi and Ben Platt, and was less sharp-edged than his speech to the college graduates. He urged the young graduates to be unafraid despite the current challenges facing the nation and to strive to be part of a diverse community.

“Leave behind all the old ways of thinking that divide us — sexism, racial prejudice, status, greed — and set the world on a different path,” Obama said.",1

April was the worst month for job losses in the history of the US.

More Americans lost their jobs last month than during the entire financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 — or during any downturn in the past 80 years.

Our official unemployment rate is now 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression. Moreover, as Insider's Carmen Reinicke explains, this rate counts only people who are actively looking for work and not finding it, so it most likely is a significant undercount, as it excludes the Americans who want to be working but aren't even looking.

The ""employment to population"" ratio also dropped to a record low. Only about half of Americans — 51% — are employed right now. The peak of this measure was about 64% in 2000.

7.7 million restaurant, bar, and hotel workers lost their jobs.

2.5 million health-services and education workers lost their jobs.

2.1 million retail and store workers lost their jobs.

And so on.

The only bright spot is that about 18 million of the 20.5 million job losses are considered temporary. At least for now, these folks think they'll be rehired when the economy improves.

This devastating jobs report raises a reasonable question that has come up often in the past few weeks:

Why, in the face of this economic and social calamity, is the stock market going up?

Back in February and early March, as the pandemic ravaged one industry after another, the stock market plunged by a third in five weeks.

Since then, the news has seemed to have only gotten worse.

And yet, since bottoming in mid-March, the stock market has risen steadily. Now, six weeks later, it has recovered about two-thirds of its losses and is not far below its all-time high.

So what gives?

Well, first, stock prices generally reflect investors' assessments about the future, not the past. As horrific as the economic news has been over the past six weeks, it has actually been better than some investors expected it might be back in mid-March.

Some economists, moreover, believe that we've already experienced the worst of the impact of the pandemic and that the economy will improve from here.

Second, the government's fast, aggressive financial response to the crisis — in the form of emergency aid packages from the Treasury and Congress and emergency liquidity from the Federal Reserve — has significantly limited the potential economic damage.

The government aid packages haven't saved all jobs (by a long shot), and they won't save all US businesses, but they've helped save a lot.

In fact, one of Wall Street's best economists, Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs, estimates that the various forms of government aid — including enhanced unemployment benefits — will actually more than offset the income Americans have collectively lost this year. This aid will not be shared equally, so there will still be plenty of individual pain, but, in aggregate, a lot of the economy's consumer spending should be maintained.

Goldman Sachs

Last of all, the market has done well because many of the most valuable companies in the index have been shielded or actually even benefitted from the crisis.

The Charles Schwab strategist Liz Ann Sonders notes that more than half of the value of the S&P 500 comes from companies in the tech, healthcare, and communications-services industries. These companies have done fine or even well in the past few months.

The so-called FANG+ companies, moreover — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, and other internet giants — make up a bigger percentage of the market than ever before. And they have collectively risen.

So, in short, for now, the reason the stock market is rising is that some investors believe we've seen the worst of the impact and that the situation will improve from here.

Other investors, meanwhile, think there's more bad news to come and those hoping for a quick recovery will be disappointed. The most famous investor on the planet, Warren Buffett, appears to be in this camp.

Which investors are right?

We'll see. No one has a crystal ball, and the endless challenge of trying to make better predictions than other investors is one reason the stock market is so fascinating.

In the meantime, our sympathies to the tens of millions of Americans who have lost their jobs in this crisis. We all hope that the optimists are right, that the worst is over, and that we can rebuild our economy quickly from here.

1176,1176,1492,Polls show Europeans losing patience with governments,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1

In early February, China's ruling Communist Party was facing one of its biggest political crises in more than three decades. A rapidly spreading outbreak of the new coronavirus was a ""massive risk and challenge"" to social stability, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned top party officials in an internal speech that was later published publicly.

But with new domestic infections near zero, China has claimed victory over a virus that much of the world is still struggling to curtail. Newly confident and sensitive to criticisms that it initially covered up the outbreak, China's leadership is now seeking to recast the pandemic as a political win by arguing that its centralized, top-down governance system made it uniquely well-suited for containing and managing the virus; according to official figures, the virus has claimed fewer than 5,000 Chinese lives.

""The way the Chinese handled the coronavirus is coupled with technology, with culture and with very effective government coordination,"" said Wang Huiyao, president of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization. ""That's something unthinkable in Western countries.""

Emboldened, China has also taken a bellicose, sometimes-threatening approach to countries that are critical of its response to the coronavirus. China has pressured European Union officials to tone down or outright remove language describing disinformation that Beijing put out during the pandemic — a story The New York Times first reported. On Twitter, Chinese diplomats have lashed out at those criticizing China's handling of the pandemic.

China has been especially aggressive in countering a narrative pushed forth with no evidence by senior U.S. officials, including President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, that the virus originated — perhaps accidentally — in a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Scientists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious disease specialist, say the novel coronavirus probably developed in nature. ""The sole purpose for some U.S. politicians trying to fool others with their obvious lies is to shift the blame of their own incompetence,"" a Foreign Ministry spokesman said last month. China's state broadcaster recently released a satirical cartoon video depicting Lego characters representing China and the U.S., with America's Statue of Liberty making contradictory statements and throwing insults as China's mask-wearing terra cotta warrior patiently explains.

YouTube

""One of the most striking elements of Chinese diplomacy at this particular time is just how undiplomatic it's been,"" said Elizabeth Economy, Asia director at the Council on Foreign Relations.

When Australia joined the U.S. in demanding an investigation into the origins of the virus in China, Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor-in-chief of the Global Times state tabloid, likened Australia to ""chewing gum stuck on the sole of China's shoes. Sometimes you have to find a stone to rub it off."" ""You do not know how aggressive, how unreasonable the West can be in making up their fictions,"" Hu told NPR.

A colorful provocateur who supports his country's more aggressive diplomacy, Hu justified China's more hawkish behavior as a natural response to American aggression. ""China is getting better and better, while the future success of the U.S. is not assured,"" said Hu. ""When the U.S. continually attacks China, mocks China, can you expect us to say nothing?""

While striking a more combative tone may have found support among its own more nationalistic citizenry, Beijing may not have expected the global backlash it is now encountering.

Faulty Chinese medical products, including face masks, have led some European countries to reject medical donations from China. Racism against thousands of Africans living in China's southern city of Guangzhou has wiped out much of the goodwill Beijing built up on the African continent. Several American lawmakers have argued that the U.S. should waive China's sovereign legal immunity; that would allow at least two states suing China for damages from the coronavirus to proceed to court.

China has shifted blame by accusing the U.S. military, without providing evidence, of first bringing the virus to Wuhan when it competed in sports games last October. The claim has gained traction on the mainland.

Zhao Lijian, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson known for his bellicose Twitter presence, has suggested several times that the coronavirus did not originate in China. State media outlets have repeatedly accused the U.S. of downplaying the severity of its outbreak.

""We think Americans came to the Wuhan seafood market in October when there were military sports games being held in Wuhan,"" said one former vendor at the Wuhan market where the first cluster of human coronavirus cases was reported. The seller would not use his name because he wants to open a new store and does not want to be associated with the market. ""The Americans are behind it all,"" he said.

Behind China's hostile rhetoric is a strong sense of aggrievement that other countries have overlooked its role in containing the coronavirus pandemic.

""People in China feel a sense of pride because they had to sacrifice and that the leadership in the [Chinese Communist] party led them in an effective way,"" said Susan Shirk, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who's now chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego.

Others sense a more nefarious purpose behind the China bashing. ""The ultimate purpose behind fanning the flames for racial discrimination and assigning responsibility is to demonize China and suppress China's rise,"" wrote Lin Yueqin, a scholar at the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in April.

Ultimately, what may be driving Chinese leaders' strident messaging is less a desire to impress other countries and more one to reassure its own citizens that China is standing up to American criticism.

""Either the Chinese diplomats are delusional, or they are simply doing their very best to prevent the international narrative from seeping into domestic Chinese discourse and undermining the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. And I would wager that the second is probably more likely than the first,"" said Economy, of the Council on Foreign Relations.

While assigning blame might score points with populist elements in both China and the U.S., it comes at a cost for an important geopolitical relationship.

""The epidemic at home was a real domestic crisis for the party leadership, and I think they've gone into overdrive to shore up domestic support,"" said Shirk, who is writing a book titled Overreach, about Chinese politics and diplomacy. ""But what's happened is they're overdoing it in a way that's causing this international backlash against them. So it's very counterproductive.""

Instead of collaborating on a global health crisis, the two countries are now even further apart, according to U.S.-China relations experts.

""The situation has decayed so much that to turn things around now and restore the level of international trust that China had previously enjoyed is all but impossible. It would be a challenge for even the most talented, cultivated and practiced diplomats,"" Zi Zhongyun, a widely respected scholar of U.S.-China relations at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in late April.

The voices of reason are increasingly being censored and silenced in China, leaving only those at the extremes of the political spectrum, Zi lamented.

""And as for the ignorant and the shameless online thugs,"" she wrote, ""well, they get a free pass.""",1
198,198,268,Lockdowns mean millions of women can’t reach birth control,"JOHANNESBURG — The callers were in tears. One by one, women in homes across rural Zimbabwe had a pleading question: When would family planning services return?

Lockdowns imposed to curb the coronavirus’ spread have put millions of women in Africa, Asia and elsewhere out of reach of birth control and other sexual and reproductive health needs. Confined to their homes with their husbands and others, they face unwanted pregnancies and little idea of when they can reach the outside world again.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

In these uncertain times, women “have to lock down their uterus,” Abebe Shibru, Zimbabwe country director for Marie Stopes International, told The Associated Press. “But there is no way in a rural area.”

Eighteen countries in Africa have imposed national lockdowns, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All but essential workers or those seeking food or health care must stay home for weeks, maybe longer. Rwanda, the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to impose a lockdown, has extended it for two weeks, a possible sign of things to come.

Even where family planning remains available, providers say many women fear venturing out and being beaten by security forces and accused of defying the new restrictions. Meanwhile, outreach services, the key to reaching rural women, have largely stopped to avoid drawing crowds and the risk of workers spreading the virus from one community to another.

The International Planned Parenthood Federation, or IPPF, in a new report Thursday says more than one in five member clinics around the world have closed because of the pandemic and related restrictions. More than 5,000 mobile clinics across 64 countries have closed. Most are in South Asia and Africa, but Latin America and Europe have seen hundreds of closures as well.

From Pakistan to Germany to Colombia, IPPF members say they have scaled down HIV testing and gender-based violence response work and face shortages of contraceptives.

“They have needs that cannot wait,” IPPF director-general Alvaro Bermejo said of women in a statement, pleading for help from national governments to help provide personal protective equipment to allow for intimate care.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild to moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia and death.

In Europe, 100 non-governmental groups on Wednesday called on governments to ensure reproductive health services during the pandemic, saying many facilities have sharply reduced them or shut down. The French government last month said pharmacies can deliver contraceptive pills to women unable to renew prescriptions under lockdown.

The predicted baby boom in Africa alone, even as birth rates have dropped in many countries as more girls are educated, will add to the growth that already is projected to see the continent of 1.3 billion people double in population by 2050.

In Zimbabwe, Marie Stopes provided more than 400,000 women last year with family planning services, Shibru said, including averting nearly 50,000 unsafe abortions. But now the organization’s outreach services, which reach more than 60% of clients, are suspended. Even at clinics that remain open, the number of clients has dropped by 70%.

That leaves a country of men, no longer free to work in the fields or elsewhere, and without the distraction of sports, confined with their wives for weeks on end.

“Husband and wife, what else can they be doing in that house?” asked Future Gwena, a Marie Stopes outreach worker. “I think we’re going to have a lot of pregnancies and, unfortunately, unintended. And most will result in unsafe abortions, domestic violence. Our community is paternalistic. If something goes wrong in the home, it’s the mother’s fault, even if the man initiated it.”

Even in normal times, the average woman seeking contraception must get consent from her husband, Shibru said.

Meanwhile, travel restrictions and manufacturing slowdowns in Asia as a result of the pandemic mean that some family planning providers are waiting for shipments of emergency contraceptives and other items as stocks run short at home.

“Today I expected a shipment from Asia, but it’s suspended,” Shibru said. “I don’t know how to fill that gap. It was supposed to come today to serve us for the coming six months. So this is one of the tragedies. ... We’re expecting a huge shortage of contraceptives in African countries. Absolutely, condoms also.”

In Uganda, Marie Stopes country director Carole Sekimpi said they don’t know when a shipment of emergency contraceptives will arrive because India, their source, has also locked down. They’ve been out of stock for a month and need oral contraceptive pills as well, she said.

“Yesterday when I heard (neighboring) Kenya talking about a lockdown in Nairobi and (the port of) Mombasa I thought, ‘My god, what’s going to happen to all of our shipments?’” she said. “Overall, there’s definitely going to be a problem.”

She worried about the girls and women confined in homes with potential assailants, even uncles or cousins. Her organization has suspended outreach, which provides about 40% of services, and clinics that remain open have seen a drop in client traffic of about 20%.

“We don’t see you anymore,” anxious callers say. “What’s happening?”

Even the capital, Kampala, has been affected. Sekimpi said she visited a large government-run hospital there on Monday, “but when I got there my heart was broken because the one service suspended was family planning. With good reason, because it’s usually crowded.”

She expects not only a baby boom but a rise in unsafe abortions and post-abortion care, along with panicky women seeking to remove their IUD (intrauterine device) or birth control implant earlier than expected as they fear no family planning worker will be around to help them later.

Even the U.S. Embassy in Uganda has taken note of the challenges women face, tweeting that “Periods don’t pause for pandemics” and sharing advice on how to make washable sanitary pads at home.

The range of issues is similar across Africa, Shibru in Zimbabwe said, citing a daily call with country directors in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Madagascar and elsewhere.

“Look, everything has been diverted to COVID,” he said of the disease caused by the coronavirus. “But after COVID, another catastrophe will be women’s health, unless something is done right now.”",1
1138,1138,1384,America Is Reopening Itself: Will Politicians Be Able To Stop It?,"I&I Editorial

Weary of more than two months of lockdowns, lost jobs, vanished income, and emotional distress, Americans are practicing a bit of Irish Democracy, shopping, dining out, gathering, and trying to carry on as before the pandemic arrived without approval from authorities. It was bound to happen.

As has been widely noted, we were initially told that we needed to shut down and shelter in place so that we would “flatten the curve” of infection growth to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed by people sick with COVID-19. That benchmark was met a little more than a month into the lockdowns. Time magazine reported in late April that “The U.S. Has Flattened the Curve.” This New York Times chart clearly shows that the flattening began early last month.

Yet many Americans are still under shelter-in-place orders, some of which have been extended. We hate to use a cliche, but politicians have been moving the goalposts. Flattening the curve isn’t good enough. They want to keep people home until there’s a vaccine; or science, which has sadly become a loose term that means whatever the user wants it to, has established an effective treatment; or maybe until there are zero coronavirus cases.

This has rankled more than a few. The masses are fed up with huddling in their homes and are yearning to breathe free.

The center of the “resistance” might be, oddly enough, in California, which has three “Free Counties.” Sutter and Yuba, just north of Sacramento, and Modoc, in the state’s far northeast corner, have reopened without Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approval. More counties quickly followed, rushing, reports the Sacramento Bee, “to persuade state health officials they are ready to reopen key segments of their local economies on a fast-track basis.”

In Southern California, Orange County engaged Newsom in a bitter battle over reopening beaches there. Newsom closed the shoreline when he saw photos that he didn’t like of people on the sand in Newport Beach. County Supervisor Michelle Steel called it an “act of retribution against Orange County.” But beachgoers eventually won by kicking up such a fuss that Newsom and state authorities were pressured into making a decision they otherwise would not have made.

Meanwhile, Michiganders are chafing under the boot of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has issued arguably the harshest lockdown orders in the country, and has even extended to May 28 her initial closure order for some businesses. The capital in Lansing has been the site of demonstrations by some deeply restless, and in many cases angry, protesters.

“We haven’t had any bloodshed yet,” one member of a Facebook group called Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine recently wrote.

We hope there is none. But tempers are short. One man has already been charged with making death threats against Whitmer and the state attorney general. And we’ve seen members of the Michigan Militia swear they aren’t going to allow law enforcement to arrest an Owosso barber who reopened his business because he had no other income. How long can she hold back demands for freedom — in America?

Other developments include:

Palm Beach County, Florida, reopened before it had met federal guidelines, according to a weekend story in the Florida Sun-Sentinel.

“Lockdown-weary New Yorkers ditched the distancing to get social instead this weekend — transforming parts of the Big Apple into a raucous, late-season Mardi Gras,” the New York Post reported last week.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court has struck down Gov. Tony Evers’ orders, immediately lifting “all restrictions on businesses and gatherings imposed by the administration’s order” while keeping “in place the closure of schools until fall.” The suit was filed by the Republican leadership in the Wisconsin Legislature.

A group has filed a lawsuit against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the attorney general for using the “pandemic as an excuse to revoke a long list of natural rights” guaranteed by the Constitution, and “recognized in the Declaration of Independence.”

Stephen Kruiser, who writes PJMedia’s Morning Briefing, suggested Monday that the lockdown governors need to be locked up. “The ‘never let a crisis go to waste’ crowd continues to overplay its hand, which is why this would be the perfect time to begin some real push-back against them,” he writes. They “need to be reined in for the financial well-being of the people whose lives they’re ruining.”

Law enforcement officers showed up Monday at a New Jersey gym that opened without permission. One of the officers read a notice informing the members they were in violation of the governor’s orders. He then said “on that note, have a good day. Everybody be safe,” before turning and walking away.

A few days after Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said that counties and businesses that plan to reopen without state approval were committing a “cowardly act,” protesters rallied on the capitol steps in Harrisburg, chanting “open us up” and “let us work.”

Other protests have been seen on Long Island, and in Sacramento; Annapolis; Washington, D.C.; North Carolina, Rhode Island, Ohio, Minnesota, and Livermore, California.

The control that politicians and unelected bureaucrats who are advising them have been exerting is clearly slipping away, and they are facing a choice: They can work with the people who feel suffocated and expeditiously restore as much normalcy as possible, or they can remain on their present course, which increases the chances there’ll be violence because either a protester or someone in a security line will make a poor decision of out anger or fear, and then pay the price on Election Day.

As Adm. Josh Painter said in “The Hunt For Red October,” “this business will get out of control. It will get out of control and we’ll be lucky to live through it.” There is that much raw emotion out there.

101,101,148,Instagram will let you browse posts with friends over video chat to promote social distancing,"Instagram is ramping up its efforts to combat coronavirus-related misinformation on its platform while also giving people tools to promote healthy behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. These new measures are in addition to the company’s existing misinformation policy, which Instagram has been actively enforcing alongside parent company Facebook over the course of the virus’s worldwide spread over the last two months.

Part of this new effort includes a new feature Instagram is calling Co-Watching, which will let you browse posts with your friends over in-app video chat. The feature can be accessed by starting a video chat through the Instagram Direct messaging tab and tapping the photo icon in the bottom left of the video chat screen. It lets you look at saved, liked, and recommended posts together as a group.

The new misinformation measures include a new educational alert at the top of search results for connecting users with World Health Organization (WHO) resources; stickers promoting accurate and verifiable information from health authorities (like a “Stay Home” sticker to promote social distancing); more aggressive removal and moderation of coronavirus-related content from the Explore tab; and downranking of content in both the Instagram feed and in Stories that doesn’t meet the bar of third-party fact-checkers.

“If posts are rated false by third-party-fact checkers, we remove them from Explore and hashtag pages,” an Instagram spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge. “We also remove false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities as having the potential to cause harm to people who believe them.”

Prior to this new set of policies, Instagram has already begun taking action against coronavirus-related misinformation in the form of banning misleading ads for products claiming to offer cures or prevent people from contracting COVID-19 as well as temporary bans on ads and branded content promoting medical supplies like face masks and hand sanitizer. Earlier this month, Instagram removed the ability the search for COVID-19-themed augmented reality effects unless they were created in partnership with a “recognized health organization,” such as the WHO.",1
1281,1283,1694,Restaurants still struggling in areas where restrictions have been lifted as many patrons still voluntarily staying home,"(Natural News) A growing handful of states have begun their reopening phases, in some cases allowing for dine-in patrons at restaurants. But reservations are still down in many areas to such a degree that some restaurant owners are unsure if their businesses will survive.

In Georgia, for instance, which was the first state to end the lockdowns and restart its economy, dine-in business has plummeted to as low as just eight percent of what it was a year prior. And in Texas, which is only allowing restaurants to open at 25 percent capacity, in some cases with airport-style “security” at the door, reservations are consequently down about 83 percent.

The two states receiving the most restaurant business are Alabama and South Carolina, but even these are seeing reservations at barely above 25 percent of normal. This is making it difficult for many restaurants to remain open even if they desperately want to return back to normal.

Because of the way things are opening back up gradually in phases, some experts predict that a shocking one in four restaurants will ultimately go out of business for good. The result will be the further decline of our nation’s economy, which is already on the rocks in many other ways due to the government’s response to the pandemic.

Even in Georgia, strict requirements were put in place to limit the number of customers in restaurants at any given time. Only 10 customers per 500 square feet are permitted, which greatly impedes the ability of restaurants to operate at a feasible capacity to still turn a profit.

Government tyranny is why American restaurants are suffering

Interestingly, polls conducted in states like Alabama and South Carolina show that the vast majority of people are willing to eat out again. The fact that restaurants are continuing to suffer, in other words, has everything to do with government restrictions on how many can eat out at a time.

Data from the National Restaurant Association shows that the restaurant industry as a whole lost an astounding $80 billion in revenue during the months of March and April, mid-March being the time when most states began to shut down in response to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

During the month of April alone, the hospitality industry saw a record five million jobs lost, meaning five million people who could have been serving patrons willing to brave the pandemic are now unemployed indefinitely.

But they were still allowed to serve take-out, right? In many cases yes, assuming this was allowed under state and municipal guidelines. The problem, however, is that to successfully run a kitchen it takes a lot of manpower, not to mention enough supplies to make a variety of meals, which many restaurants simply could not provide with very limited service capacity.

Even with the lockdowns being somewhat lifted in many areas it is still not enough for these businesses to survive, let alone thrive.

“Restaurants are complicated beasts,” says OpenTable CEO Steve Hafner. “You have to order food and supplies. You have to make sure you’ve prepped the kitchen and service areas to be easily disinfected.”

Meanwhile, Anthony Fauci, who heads a government agency promoting new “blockbuster” drugs and vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), has stated that he believes the country is moving too fast and that everything should continue to remain closed indefinitely.

“I think we’re going in the right direction, but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak,” he is quoted as saying.

Last we checked, the goal was never to attain “total control” over this outbreak, but rather to “flatten the curve.” Why have the goal posts suddenly shifted?

672,672,817,"$2.5M in coronavirus stimulus to Navy Pier Inc., clout-heavy nonprofit run by $500K exec","Navy Pier Inc., the clout-heavy not-for-profit whose president is paid more than $540,000 a year, has received a nearly $2.5 million coronavirus stimulus loan from the federal government toward salaries and other expenses.

Facing what it says are losses of $10 million, Navy Pier Inc. says the loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program will cover expenses and the salaries of 147 employees, some who have been “sidelined” since the pier was shut down in March by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The federal loan will be used to cover all salaries, including that of Marilyn Kelly Gardner, the Navy Pier Inc. president and chief executive officer whose salary, bonus and other compensation totaled $541,051 in 2018, according to records filed with the Internal Revenue Service.

The company’s board of directors, which includes former Mayor Richard M. Daley’s daughter, spends more than $3 million a year on pay for Gardner and seven other top employees. That includes $419,204 for chief operating officer Brian Murphy, a former Chicago cop who was Daley’s deputy chief of staff, and $258,816 for vice president of operations Michael Degnan, the son of longtime Daley political adviser Timothy Degnan.

The pier’s payroll topped $15.4 million for 2018, the most recent data available.

The $2,489,500 loan “made it possible for us to resume work and payroll from some employees who had been sidelined prior to receiving the loan,” according to Navy Pier Inc. spokeswoman Payal Patel. “Unlike other similar cultural institutions sitting on public land in Chicago, the pier does not have an endowment nor does it receive any monetary support from any government entity. Ninety percent of Navy Pier’s revenue is realized through earned operating income, and the balance is generated through philanthropy.”

Navy Pier Inc. does get a big break on rent, though. It pays the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois just $1 a year to lease the pier, which is the state’s largest tourist attraction.

The PPP loans cover about 10 weeks of expenses and won’t have to be repaid as long as the companies don’t cut their workforces.

Illinois businesses, including the parent company of the Chicago Sun-Times, secured about 69,000 loans through April 16 totaling $15.9 billion, according to SBA data.

Navy Pier was long run by the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, a government agency established by the city and the state to oversee the pier and also to operate McCormick Place. In 2011 as Daley was soon to leave City Hall, he agreed to a deal, approved by Illinois legislators, to allow the authority to lease the pier to the newly created Navy Pier Inc., run by Daley allies including his daughter Nora Daley Conroy.

Navy Pier’s operators, past and present, have a history of making deals with politically connected people and businesses, giving them lucrative contracts to operate restaurants and shops and other attractions that together lure 9 million visitors a year to the pier.

Who got those deals was public information when McPier ran Navy Pier. Now, the not-for-profit’s board says the public no longer is entitled to know the terms of those lucrative contracts.

The Better Government Association has sued for such access. Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas Allen threw out the suit, but the BGA has appealed to the Illinois Appellate Court.

In 2018, Navy Pier Inc. lost nearly $5.5 million, primarily because its revenue declined to $56.5 million from $65.3 million the previous year.

At the end of 2018, Navy Pier Inc. owed $57.9 million in bonds and construction loans. It’s required to pay slightly more than $3 million on those debts this year.

With Illinois residents still sheltering at home while non-essential businesses remain closed under orders from Gov. J.B. Pritzker, there’s no timetable for Navy Pier to reopen or to resume its weekly fireworks displays along the lakefront.

“We got to be open to the public as soon as this thing lifts,” according to a source familiar with Navy Pier’s operations, who says the hope is that the government money will allow that to happen.",1
484,484,590,91-year-old woman stays busy by doing fashion shows during quarantine,"A 91-year-old fashionista in Georgia is not letting her wardrobe go to waste. While Georgia is slowly opening up, Betty McDonald is in a high-risk group for coronavirus and she can't go out to socialize. But she's found a new way to show off her outfits.

""I've got three closets full of clothes ... and jewelry like you wouldn't believe,"" McDonald told CBS Atlanta affiliate WGCL. ""I mentioned to my caretaker that I sure miss getting dressed up."" Her caretaker, Kim Taylor, wanted to do something to help take their minds off the pandemic.

So they started holding daily fashion shows in the yard. ""Every day she does a different outfit, and I take pictures,"" Taylor told the station.

Kim Taylor takes photos of Betty McDonald's outfits so they can take their minds off the pandemic and have fun. Kim Taylor

Taylor has snapped countless photos of McDonald in flowing skirts, elaborate baubles and interesting hats. All of her outfits are perfectly coordinated. ""I like flashy stuff, as you can tell,"" McDonald said.

McDonald's husband passed away in 2007 and she doesn't have any kids. She has Taylor send the photos and videos from their fashion shows to family, friends and neighbors to lift their spirits, WGCL reports.

""She has lots of people telling her that it's reminded them that there's more to life than watching television, and hearing the latest on COVID-19,"" Taylor said.

After Taylor put some of their videos on YouTube, she ""received almost 200 comments and she loved sitting down and telling me what to type for her responses,"" Taylor told CBS News via email. ""She is like a kid on Christmas Day opening up many gifts.""

The pandemic hasn't been easy on McDonald, who loves being outside, traveling and socializing. ""It's a very sad time, it's heartbreaking,"" she told WGCL.

She was anxious about the coronavirus, but the fashion shows have helped take her mind off of things.

""At 91, she is in the high-risk group as far as if something should happen, and she told me once, I don't know how much longer I have to live, yet she can find joy in doing something for today,"" Taylor said.",1
1387,1394,1936,"Report: Cuomo shipped off 4,300 coronavirus patients to NY nursing homes","(Natural News) Over 4,300 recovering COVID-19 patients were shipped off to New Yorkâs nursing homes and long-term care facilities as a result of a controversial state directive, according to The Associated Press.

In a count published on its site Friday, the news organization tallied the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals and transferred to nursing homes under Gov. Andrew Cuomoâs March 25 directive after the New York State Health Department declined to release the figures gleaned from its internal survey, conducted two weeks ago.

The health department is still verifying âincompleteâ data.

According to critics, the directive, which had been intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged, instead only helped speed up the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus in the mentioned establishments, in addition to placing an additional burden on already overwhelmed facilities.

âA number of nursing homes have felt constrained by the order and admitted hospital discharged patients without knowing what their COVID status was,â said Chris Laxton, executive director of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

According to numbers posted by New Yorkâs Department of Health, the state’s nursing home COVID-19 death toll stood well over 5,000 as of this writing, making it a significant chunk of the stateâs total running death toll from the virus.

The directive, which also noted that the stateâs nursing homes and related facilities cannot refuse patients, was reversed on May 10.

Following intense criticism, Cuomo, in his subsequent media briefings, said he was merely following recommendations set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

No matter how much Cuomo spins the said directive however, Stuart Almer, a nursing home operator, said it cannot be denied that the state order still put staff and residents at great risk.

âWe canât draw a straight line from bringing in someone positive to someone catching the disease, but weâre talking about elderly, fragile and vulnerable residents,â Almer stated in an interview with AP. (Related: New York nursing homes now a âslaughterhouseâ for elderly coronavirus patients.)

According to Almer, his staff at Gurwin Jewish, a 460-bed nursing home on Long Island, had to scramble in order to accommodate what he called a âfloodâ of 58 recovering COVID-19 patients from local hospitals.

Almer stressed that while they did what they could to ensure the safety of their residents, such as by erecting more walls and by implementing other safety measures, residents at Gurwin nonetheless started falling sick, 47 of which died of confirmed or suspected COVID-19.

The families of those who died are furious.

“It was the single dumbest decision anyone could make if they wanted to kill people,” Daniel Arbeeny told the AP in an interview.

According to Arbeeny, his 88-year-old father succumbed to the virus after being pulled out of a Brooklyn nursing home that saw more than 50 deaths.

“This isn’t rocket science. We knew the most vulnerable were in nursing homes and rehab centers,” Arbeeny said, citing studies that pointed to the elderly and immunocompromised as being the most likely to succumb to the virus.

Former New York lieutenant governor and Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths founder Betsy McCaughey did not mince words when speaking about the current situation in the stateâs nursing homes.

âTheyâre death pits,â McCaughey told The New York Times.

âThese nursing homes are already overwhelmed. Theyâre crowded and theyâre understaffed. One COVID-positive patient in a nursing home produces carnage,â she added.

As of press time, the state of New York has recorded a running total of 358,000 infections and 23,195 deaths from the coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

823,823,992,Coronavirus puts the future of college — and colleges — in limbo,"SAN FRANCISCO — Like so many college students who have seen campus life supplanted by a computer screen thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, Allie Larman faces a difficult decision about the fall semester.

Set to enter her junior year at the University of California, Davis, where she is earning a double major in community and regional development and Spanish, Larman returned to her parents’ home in nearby Albany, Calif., in mid-March, when Gavin Newsom became the nation’s first governor to issue shelter-in-place restrictions that put an end to in-person instruction.

Larman and nearly 40,000 of her classmates continued their education on Zoom, an online platform few had ever heard of before and that teachers and students alike have found to be a disorienting, two-dimensional substitute.

“I feel like I’m definitely not learning as much in my classes and I’m not having a very good time,” Larman told Yahoo News. “I really thrive off of being on campus. Seeing all of my friends in my classes really keeps me engaged. I like going to the coffee shop on campus and walking around. I like that routine.”

While Larman says that “the school did a really good job considering the crazy circumstances,” Zoom instruction isn’t what she bargained for, and she’s considering taking a leave of absence rather than return for another quarter of online offerings.

“I’m not sure if it’s worth around $5,000 a quarter [the cost of tuition only, excluding room and board] to attend a Zoom university,” Larman said.

She’s not alone. Dozens of students and their parents have filed lawsuits against colleges and universities this spring seeking tuition reimbursement. But the question of value is even more pressing looking ahead. Last week, California State University announced it would hold most of its classes next year online thanks to the coronavirus. That means 500,000 students will have to decide, in Larman’s words, whether “to attend a Zoom university.” If polling on this question is accurate, that could prove ruinous for higher education. A recent survey conducted by the American Council on Education found that nearly 20 percent of students currently enrolled in college are either unsure they will continue in the fall or say they will definitely not do so.

And the academic disruption caused by the pandemic has sparked a debate about the future of higher education in America.

“Nobody knows what the retention rates are going to be in the fall,” Roblin Meeks, associate dean of graduate studies at Manhattan’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told Yahoo News. “I think everybody is in a holding pattern. If Congress appropriates money for the states, then it won’t be as bad. It’s hard to know how much money the campuses are going to have to work with.”

John Jay, with 13,000 undergraduate and 2,000 graduate students, is part of the City University of New York, which receives approximately 60 percent of its funding from the state.

“There’s no school in the CUNY system that has a large endowment,” Meeks said. “Everyone is tuition-driven, so if a bunch of your students don’t show up, that’s really bad.”

It’s unclear when restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus, which hit New York harder than any other city in the world, will be lifted. While the president of the well-endowed Ivy League Brown University, Christina Paxson, foresees implementing rigorous coronavirus testing, contact-tracing cellphone apps and new social distancing policies in order to lure students back to campus, for colleges in the CUNY system like John Jay, making that transition is harder to envision.",1
1178,1178,1494,How Russia’s Coronavirus Crisis Got So Bad,"Despite the official assurances, by mid-March our only topic was coronavirus. Should we be worried or not? Some were cavalier. “It’s a bunch of nonsense,” said Masha, the owner of a big friendly mutt. Others were worried, especially if they had health problems or, like one neighbor, a newborn grandchild at home. And we were all worried about the dozen or so small businesses that had appeared on our block in the past couple years — especially because some of the owners were our neighbors.

Alexander, the owner of a big white boxer, has a nail salon in the building next to us. He was worried. The ruble had already tumbled against the dollar and euro. To be on the safe side, he had borrowed some money from a friend and bought a large stockpile of imported materials. And then he waited. But not for long. Just about a week later, Sobyanin, the Moscow mayor, ordered all nonessential stores and services to close, including Alexander’s nail salon.

In other countries, salons might have closed immediately. But Alexander was worried about his staff. He called them in to discuss their options, and they decided to take the opposite approach, to keep the salon open late every night until the cutoff date, March 28, so that they could earn enough money to hold them over for a week or so. That was almost two months ago. The salon has been closed since.

Alexander and his wife have other jobs that provide basic income. He thinks some of his staff are earning money doing house calls, and others are just waiting it out. Even when he can reopen, he doesn’t really know how to reopen. “It’s a question of safety for the staff and customers. I can figure out how to keep two meters between customers, but when will people feel safe and confident enough to come in?” He thinks it may be a year or more before he can recoup losses and pay off the debt in rent he is running up.

Another neighbor and dog owner Sergei runs a specialty shop. He used to get 35 to 50 orders a day; now it’s two or three. “My landlord lowered the rent by 40 percent, but that doesn’t help much when income has fallen by 90 percent,” he told me.

I asked Nikolai Petrov, a senior research fellow on the Russia and Eurasia Program at Chatham House in London and professor in the political science department at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, why he thought Putin was willing to risk alienating voters like Alexander and Sergei.

Petrov said Putin didn’t need their support. “Authoritarian regimes rely on important people who are key to stability and staying in power,” he said. “Putin’s political base is the big companies, banks and state companies. He doesn’t depend on citizens, so he doesn’t see or hear those 10 or 15 or 20 percent of the population who are really suffering today from the measures to fight Covid.”

On May 11, Putin announced that the “national vacation” that had begun in March would end the next day, but that each regional leader would determine how and when to open up businesses. In Moscow, Sobyanin announced that the lockdown would continue until at least the end of the month and now include mandatory gloves and masks in public places, but that several categories of business could open. People shook their heads: Is the situation more dangerous or safer?

And there was a new joke making the rounds: “When we had 1,000 new infections every day, we were put on lockdown. Now that we have over 10,000 new infections every day, they’re sending us back to work.”

The problem is that not everyone is going back to work or working at home on salary. Small shops, businesses and services are still closed. In our neighborhood, one beauty salon — a branch of a citywide chain — closed and moved out within the first week of the lockdown. Three other shops have closed and might not reopen.

With the economic pressure mounting, Putin announced in his May address that he would increase aid to the population, mostly through direct payments to families with children, but including tax and insurance write-offs for sole proprietors and even reimbursement of income taxes paid in 2019. I asked my friends if this would help; they laughed. The first round of aid consisted mostly of benefits such as partial debt forgiveness, salary reimbursements if companies continued to pay their staff, and some tax deferments — none of which they qualified for or needed — and the current aid package wasn’t enough to make up for their catastrophic loss of income and continued rent payments.

But neither Alexander nor Sergei had expected state aid. “We never thought we’d get any support,” Sergei said. “But that’s the deal. Either you’re free and are totally on your own, or you work for the state and get a salary and aid, but you also have to do what they say, go to political rallies, whatever. Better to be free.”

Looking ahead, it’s clear that millions of small-business people, gig economy workers, waiters, salespeople, actors, dancers, musicians, museum curators, nannies, cleaners, fitness instructors and all those Russians working off the books — a large portion of the population — could come out of this with nothing. If they hold on to their businesses, they will probably have a huge debt to pay off. Many thousands, if not millions, of them could lose everything.

To some extent, given the nature of the crisis, economic pain is inevitable. Sonin says, “The crisis is unprecedented, and because the government didn’t move quickly and the measures aren’t, to my mind, sufficient, the downturn will be greater. But getting out of this crisis would have been difficult regardless of what Russia did.”

The government’s approach isn’t going to improve its popularity ratings, Sonin says, but adds, “I don’t think there is a risk of great discontent. In 2008 and 2009, the GDP fell by 9 percent, and the majority of households were cutting back on basic necessities. But the public didn’t rebel then, and I think it will be about the same this time.”

Nor does he think this crisis, however difficult, will spur Russian leadership to change: “There is no discussion of reconsidering priorities, like cutting back on defense spending, security, or propaganda, or repealing the countersanctions, which in my view would have been the first thing to do. There is no discussion of any of that. That’s not being done because they think the way things are is the way the things ought to be.”",1

But Russian President Vladimir Putin believes there may be more pain ahead.

According to Putin, the virus may once again begin to spread widely from October to November. During a meeting to discuss the epidemiological situation in Russia, he said the country needs to be ready for a second wave later in the year.

Putin added that the removal of the present restrictions in Russia must be guided by science. However, he also asked officials to prepare recommendations for dealing with the consequences of the pandemic, especially the economic repercussions.

“In order to gradually emerge from restrictions with which we still live to a large extent today, we need to think about what the experts here and their colleagues abroad are talking about, that another wave may possibly come in the fall,” Putin warned.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin insisted that he feels obliged to maintain the current lockdown in the capital, including the system of self-isolation and the control of movement using digital passes. Moscow has largely been shut down for almost two months now – since March 29.

Anna Popova, the head of health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, pointed out that the infection curve has been flattening in Russia. She praised the country’s medical system for its handling of the crisis and said the nationwide spread is showing a “clear downward trend.” Putin noted that there are now fewer new positive tests in Moscow, which has borne the brunt of the Russian outbreak.

According to official statistics, a total of 326,448 cases of Covid-19 have been found in Russia, with over half in the Moscow area. The reported death toll is 3,249 with 99,825 people known to have recovered.

575,575,705,Roy Horn of Siegfried & Roy dies from coronavirus at 75,"LAS VEGAS — Roy Horn of Siegfried & Roy, the duo whose extraordinary magic tricks astonished millions until Horn was critically injured in 2003 by one of the act’s famed white tigers, has died. He was 75.

Horn died of complications from the coronavirus on Friday in a Las Vegas hospital, according to a statement released by publicist Dave Kirvin.

“Today, the world has lost one of the greats of magic, but I have lost my best friend,” Siegfried Fischbacher said in the statement. “From the moment we met, I knew Roy and I, together, would change the world. There could be no Siegfried without Roy, and no Roy without Siegfried.”

He was injured in October 2003 when a tiger named Montecore attacked him on stage at the Mirage hotel-casino in Las Vegas. He had severe neck injuries, lost a lot of blood and later suffered a stroke. He underwent lengthy rehabilitation, but the attack ended the long-running Las Vegas Strip production.

The darker-haired of the flashy duo, Horn was credited with the idea of introducing an exotic animal — his pet cheetah — to the magic act.

“Roy was a fighter his whole life including during these final days,” Fischbacher said. “I give my heartfelt appreciation to the team of doctors, nurses and staff at Mountain View Hospital who worked heroically against this insidious virus that ultimately took Roy’s life.”

The two became an institution in Las Vegas, where their magic and artistry consistently attracted sellout crowds. The pair performed six shows a week, 44 weeks per year.

They returned to the stage in February 2009 for what was billed as their one and only comeback performance, to raise funds for the new Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. The brief performance, which included Montecore, became the basis of an episode of the ABC television show “20/20.”

Horn and Siegfried Fischbacher, both natives of Germany, had first teamed up in 1957 and made their Las Vegas debut a decade later. Siegfried & Roy began performing at the Mirage in 1990.

When they signed a lifetime contract with the Mirage in 2001, it was estimated they had performed 5,000 shows at the casino for 10 million fans since 1990 and had grossed more than $1 billion. That comes on top of thousands of shows at other venues in earlier years.

“Throughout the history of Las Vegas, no artists have meant more to the development of Las Vegas’ global reputation as the entertainment capital of the world than Siegfried and Roy,” Terry Lanni, chairman of MGM Mirage, the casino’s parent company, said after the attack.

The pair gained international recognition for helping to save rare white tigers and white lions from extinction. Their $10 million compound was home to dozens of rare animals over the years. The white lions and white tigers were the result of a preservation program that began in the 1980s.

“The good news is that the white tigers and white lions are going into the 21st century,” Horn said in a 1999 interview with The Associated Press. “The bad news is that if we don’t do something about the tigers in the wild, they will disappear.”

Siegfried & Roy’s show, incorporating animal antics and magic tricks, included about 20 white tigers and lions, the number varying depending on the night. The show also had other exotic animals, including an elephant.

“Their show is so fast-paced the viewer has time only to gasp before the next dazzlement,” an Associated Press reviewer wrote in 1989 when they brought their act to New York.

“A white car drives on stage — as Liberace used to do — bringing a mother white tiger and three cubs. Roy rides an elephant, which disappears, then reappears. At the end, a 650-pound white tiger climbs atop a globe. With Roy on his back, they’re pulled into the air.”

“It’s a Las Vegas show and it’s nonstop entertainment. New Yorkers aren’t too sophisticated for this.”

A later spectacular developed for the Mirage opened with a flashy “Star Wars” scenario and Horn and Fischbacher arriving in their own mini space capsules. Another segment had Horn sitting atop a 30-foot (9.1-meter) pyramid that was “destroyed” by an explosion and fire, leaving him levitated high above the stage.

It was halfway during a performance Oct. 3, 2003, when Horn was alone on stage with the tiger that it suddenly lunged at him.

Horn, who had turned 59 that day, had never been injured during a show before, “not a scratch, not by an animal,” Bernie Yuman, the pair’s longtime manager, said at the time.

He said he thought Montecore, a 7-year-old male, got distracted by something in the audience and Horn was trying to calm him. Horn himself said later that he fainted and the tiger was trying to help him by dragging him offstage, though animal experts disputed that possibility.

An investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture explored a variety of theories but was unable to reach a conclusion on what caused the tiger to attack. In its final report, the USDA also said the show’s producers had failed to protect the audience because there was no barrier separating the exotic animals from the crowd.

In October 2006, three years after the attack, Horn and Fischbacher attended their induction into the Las Vegas Walk of Stars. Horn’s speech was sluggish at times and he walked a bit slow, but he called the event “a deeply emotional experience.”

Born in Nordenham, Germany, Horn met Fischbacher on a cruise ship in 1957. Fischbacher performed the magic tricks, while Horn became his assistant, eventually suggesting using the cheetah in the act.

They honed their animal-magic show in small clubs in Germany and Switzerland in the mid-1960s. Their break came in a Monte Carlo casino when an agent in the audience invited them to Las Vegas. The pair made their debut at the Tropicana hotel-casino in the late 1960s.

The illusionists became popular in the 1970s, receiving their first star billing in 1978 as headliners of the Stardust’s “Lido de Paris.” Their show “Beyond Belief” opened in 1981 at the Frontier and played to thousands over seven years.

When Horn and Fischbacher became U.S. citizens in 1988, an elated Horn said, “Being an American means all the things we believe in.”

Horn once hand-fed a white lion cub born prematurely, starting with an eyedropper. But when a cub was donated to a zoo, Horn said he was heartbroken.

“When you love something, the hardest thing is to let it go,” he said. “But this is what Siegfried and Roy do. We live our dreams, and we fulfill our destiny.”

778,778,947,"Abbott rapid COVID-19 test may yield false negatives, FDA warns","The federal Food and Drug Administration issued a warning Thursday night that early data suggests Abbott Laboratories’ rapid coronavirus test, touted by the Trump administration as a game changer, may return inaccurate and false negative results — findings the Chicago-area firm vehemently denied.

The Abbott ID NOW test — which can provide results in minutes — is used by the White House to quickly test anyone who comes into proximity of President Donald Trump. Trump has lavished attention on the Abbott ID NOW test and featured it at a White House event three days after the FDA fast-tracked its approval by granting an emergency use authorization on March 27.

In just a few weeks time, Abbott has shipped 1.8 million of the ID NOW tests, which is used at several Chicago-area testing sites.

The FDA warning came a day after a New York University preliminary study raised questions about its accuracy. The study was not subject to peer review, a process that checks on the procedures used for a study as well as its findings.

“We are still evaluating the information about inaccurate results and are in direct communications with Abbott about this important issue,” Dr. Tim Stenzel, director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.

“We will continue to study the data available and are working with the company to create additional mechanisms for studying the test. This test can still be used and can correctly identify many positive cases in minutes. Negative results may need to be confirmed with a high-sensitivity authorized molecular test.”

Abbott: Study flawed

Abbott, headquartered in Lake County near North Chicago, said the NYU study is flawed.

“We’re seeing studies being conducted to understand the role of ID NOW in ways that it was not designed to be used,” the company said in a statement. “In particular, the NYU study results are not consistent with other studies. While we’ve seen a few studies with sensitivity performance percentages in the 80s, we’ve also seen other studies with sensitivity at or above 90%, and one as high as 94%.

“While we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection, specimen type, collection, handling, storage, transport and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run. ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method,” Abbott said.

That test compared findings between two systems: the Abbott ID NOW and the Cepheid Xpert Xpress. The samples were obtained from 101 patients with COVID-19 symptoms seeking treatment at New York University’s Langone Tisch Hospital.

In using one kind of nasal swab and liquid to store the sample, the “Abbot ID NOW COVID-19 missed a third of the samples detected positive by Cepheid Xpert Xpress” with the rate going to 48% using a different type of nasal swab, the study found.

Though the FDA acknowledged it was aware of some studies that have raised concern over the accuracy of Abbott’s device, the agency said in the statement it “is investigating whether it could be due to the types of swabs used or the type of viral transport media.”

Rapid testing is seen as key to easing stay-at-home orders and Abbott’s ID NOW was one of the first on the market.

Some inaccurate negative results

The Abbott ID NOW system also has the advantage that the machine used to analyze samples is about the size of a toaster and can be used anywhere.

Abbott and the FDA are currently working to analyze the information that has been gathered and to alert users that any negative results that aren’t consistent with a patient’s symptoms or signs should be confirmed with another test.

The FDA is now reviewing 15 “adverse reports” about the device which “suggest some users are receiving inaccurate negative results.” Abbott has also agreed to conduct post-market studies of the device that will include at least 150 COVID-19 patients in various clinical settings.

The FDA granted Abbott emergency use authorization — known as EUA — for the test on March 27. Abbott said in a release when the ID NOW went on the market, the “ID NOW COVID-19 rapid point-of-care test can provide test results in 13 minutes or less. Early detection can accelerate care, reduce viral spread and help people get on the road to recovery sooner.”

Physician here had doubts

At least one local physician has been hesitant to use the scrutinized Abbott test even before the new study.

When Dr. Rahul Khare started offering coronavirus testing at his clinic in Lincoln Park, he opted to use polymerase chain reaction tests that he sends to an outside lab for processing. Though it takes about three days to get results back, Khare didn’t even consider using the speedier Abbott test

“I’m very particular about the tests I use and I know the technology of that test because it’s the same technology that I’ve used for Abbott rapid flu and strep [tests]. And I just know they’re not very good for a variety of reasons,” said Khare, founder of Innovative Express Care.

“It’s a very specific thing that happens: When you use a DNA amplifier, the problem is if you don’t get an adequate amount of the specimen, it makes it invalid. And on top of that, I know that that’s just not as best of a technology as PCR.”",1
862,862,1033,"What is a coronavirus ""super-spreading"" event?","A recent investigation showed that dozens of people were infected with the coronavirus during what is known as a ""super-spreading"" event. After a choir practice in Washington state in March, 52 out of 61 attendees became ill, 32 of whom were confirmed to have COVID-19 and 20 had symptoms consistent with the virus, according to Skagit County Public Health.

The investigation determined that only one person at the practice had ""cold-like symptoms"" beginning a few days prior to the practice. That individual was later confirmed to have COVID-19, Skagit County Public Health said.

The choir practice is not the only super-spreading event that has happened during the coronavirus pandemic, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the potential for these events ""underscores the importance"" of social distancing and avoiding large gatherings.

Here's a breakdown of what these events are and how they happen.

What is a super-spreading event?

Super-spreading events ""occur when a single person infects a large number of other people — sometimes 10, 20, sometimes even more in one setting,"" said Dr. Justin Lessler, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.



Other examples of super-spreading events during the coronavirus pandemic include 15 cases stemming from one person at multiple family gatherings in Chicago and more than 100 cases tracing back to multiple South Korean nightclubs that were visited by a man who later tested positive for the virus.



The term ""super-spreader"" refers to a person who spreads a disease to a large number of people.

""It's kind of different for different diseases whether it's a person or an event, but for COVID, it would be more like an event,"" said Dr. Jaline Gerardin, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.



The ""world's most famous super-spreader"" was Mary Mallon, known as ""Typhoid Mary,"" Lessler said. She infected many people with typhoid fever over several years in the early 1900s.

How do super-spreading events happen?

These events happen because of ""a combination of biology and setting,"" Lessler said.

An infected person has to be at a point in their illness when they are very transmissible and they have to be in a place where they can infect a lot of other people.

Places where people are densely packed and engaging in something that involves a lot of breathing, like singing or talking, are particularly risky for super spreading, Gerardin said.

Could the infected person be asymptomatic?

Yes, the person could be asymptomatic or presymptomatic, the doctors said.

""They may not feel sick, but the infection has spread enough in their body that they're shedding virus and they're putting enough virus out there to infect other people,"" Lessler said.

What is the average infection rate for the coronavirus?

Doctors have said they believe the number of people that one person with coronavirus typically infects is two to three. That number, however, is considered ""over-dispersed,"" Lessler said.

""When we say over-dispersed, what we mean is there are super-spreading events, so the average might be two, let's say, but most people are infecting one or no people and then a very few people are infecting 8 to 10 or even more people,"" he said.

The number of typical infections also varies by the density of an area and whether or not people are staying home.

How do we prevent super-spreading events?

The social distancing guidelines many places have adopted help reduce super-spreading events, the doctors said.

""We can either prevent them entirely by limiting the size of gatherings or we can mitigate a lot of the risk through good prevention,"" such as having everyone wear masks and being somewhere that's well ventilated, Gerardin said.",1
48,48,82,How NASA is preparing to launch humans to space as coronavirus pandemic worsens,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen in the US, NASA is still moving forward with many of its upcoming missions, including some launches that will send humans to the International Space Station in the near future. As of now, NASA does not foresee any changes being made to these missions, and there are already procedures in place to guarantee astronauts do not bring any illnesses with them into space.

NASA has its own internal “response framework” for how it plans to deal with the pandemic. It lists four different stages for the agency, which each detail the amount of people who will work from home, the level of access to NASA facilities, and how much travel will be allowed. Right now, two NASA centers — Ames Research Center and Marshall Space Flight Center — are on Stage 3, which makes telework mandatory and only allows “mission-essential” personnel on site at facilities. NASA bumped these two centers to Stage 3 after employees tested positive for COVID-19 at each place.

NASA has its own internal “response framework” for how to deal with the pandemic

NASA’s Johnson Space Center, which oversees the agency’s human spaceflight launches and operates the International Space Station, is only at Stage 2. At that level, teleworking is strongly encouraged, though not mandatory, while various facilities are closed down. “The health and safety of NASA’s workforce is the agency’s top priority. As the coronavirus (COVID-19) concern continues to escalate, NASA is taking steps to ensure its workforce is protected and informed,” a NASA spokesperson at JSC said in a statement.

But as more workers at JSC stay home, they’re still looking ahead to the next launch of people to the ISS, which is slated for April 9th out of Kazakhstan. A Russian Soyuz rocket will launch three crew members, including NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy, to the station, where they’ll join three people already in orbit.

That launch is still on, and NASA says the agency hasn’t made any changes to operations and schedule surrounding the mission. As of yesterday, Kazakhstan effectively closed its borders after reporting its first coronavirus cases in the country. No one can enter the country except for diplomats, returning citizens, and those invited by the country’s government, according to Reuters. NASA is still assessing if changes are needed regarding how personnel will travel to Kazakhstan.

Of course, the concern is that the astronauts flying to the station could carry the coronavirus with them, if they don’t know that they’re infected with the virus. But NASA already has a long-held strategy in place for preventing astronauts from carrying any nasty bugs with them to space. All astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine called “health stabilization,” according to NASA. That way, the agency can make sure the crew is not incubating any illnesses before launch. However, NASA said it “will continue to evaluate and augment this plan, in coordination with its international and commercial partners” if needed.

In the meantime, Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, has decided to shut down all media activity surrounding the Soyuz launch, barring journalists from covering the mission in person. Russia will still live stream the launch, and NASA typically airs all of its crewed launches on its own online TV channel.

All astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine

Once this launch is over, the next big milestone for JSC is the return of crew from the ISS. NASA astronauts Andrew Morgan, Jessica Meir, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka are slated to return to Earth in a Soyuz capsule in mid-April, landing in the Kazakhstan desert. Such landings typically require large groups of recovery personnel to extract the astronauts from the landed capsule. NASA did not provide any details if those operations would change in light of the pandemic.

However, NASA has more than one upcoming crewed mission on its calendar. Soon, NASA’s commercial partner SpaceX will be ready to send its first crew of NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. The launch is a critical one for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, an initiative to develop privately funded vehicles to transport people to and from the ISS. SpaceX has been developing its Crew Dragon capsule for the program, and the first vehicle that will fly a crew of two to the station is already in Florida ahead of its inaugural flight.

SpaceX is currently targeting May for that flight, according to the company’s president Gwynne Shotwell. NASA also says that SpaceX’s passengers for the mission, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, are continuing to train for the mission as originally planned. As for operations at SpaceX, it seems like things are still moving ahead as usual. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sent an email last week to the company’s employees underplaying the coronavirus threat, arguing people were more likely to die in a car crash than from the virus.

Of course, the situations at NASA and SpaceX are subject to change quickly. The coronavirus pandemic is ever-evolving, with cities, states, and countries making swift changes every few hours to combat the spread of the disease. And already, launches are being affected. Europe’s primary spaceport in French Guiana, South America is suspending all launches from the site for the foreseeable future, in order to protect the health of employees and people in the area.

It’s possible that upcoming launches from the US could be postponed as well. It just depends on how companies plan to react and if governments take even more decisive action.",1
375,375,467,"NBC Sports Chicago to host star-studded COVID-19 fundraiser, pay tribute to front-line workers","When the sports world came to a standstill last month in an attempt to limit the spread of the coronavirus, Eddie Olczyk knew he couldn’t just sit back and ride out the pandemic at his home.

So, he called NBC Sports Chicago senior vice president and general manager Kevin Cross and pitched the idea of the station potentially holding a telethon.

“I said, ‘Listen, Eddie, you got me at hello. I think it’s a great idea,” Cross said Tuesday in a phone interview. “As a station, [we had] been doing things to try to help the community as well. We put together a promo that got all of our talent together and told everybody to be strong and ... we were looking at what else we could do and when Edzo came with this idea, we ran with it.”

In partnership with United Way of Metro Chicago and Chicago Community Trust, NBC Sports Chicago is hosting the “Be Chicago: Together We Can” telethon Wednesday, which will benefit the community COVID-19 Response Fund and honor front-line workers.

The four-hour TV event, which begins at 7 p.m., will feature several celebrated Chicago athletes — like Horace Grant, A.J. Pierzynski and Brian Urlacher — and exclusive music performances by Chicago, Brett Eldredge and the Plain White T’s.

There will be segments on the 1990s Bulls, 2005 White Sox and 2010 Blackhawks, with some players from each team discussing their favorite memories. Tim Anderson, Coby White and Tarik Cohen will also team up for a segment where the three young stars will discuss how their professional and personal lives have been affected by the pandemic and how this experience has changed their lives.

Fans without cable can tune in to the event on the MyTeams by NBC Sports app.

“People need a release,” said David Kaplan, who is co-hosting the event with Olczyk. “And I think tomorrow night will give [that release to] people. They understand what we’re all fighting against, but they’re also going to have a lot of fun.”

But the night’s focus isn’t all on sports.

The telethon will also include “Hero segments,” where nominated front-line workers will meet their favorite Chicago athletes via Zoom video conferencing.

Kaplan got to be on the call with one Lutheran General Hospital nurse who helped COVID-19 patients and their families. The nurse was surprised to learn his favorite athlete, Jon Lester, was also on the call.

We won’t give away too many spoilers, but Lester promised to give the nurse a once-in-a-lifetime experience at Wrigley Field when baseball returns.

“It was an emotionally charged moment,” Kaplan said. “And yeah, it’s cool to have all these celebrities on the thing .... but those are the moments people are going to get tears and go, ‘That’s amazing.’”

Most of the programming will be pre-taped and the interviews featured all took place via video conferencing calls from the individual’s own homes.

“We didn’t want to do something where we’re telling people to stay at home but we’re leaving our homes,” Cross said, “because that would be kind of hypocritical.”

There is one exception, however. Kaplan said he met up with Olczyk in the former Blackhawks forward’s backyard to shoot the opener, though he promised the camera crew wore masks and there was a tape measurer on the ground to make sure Kaplan and Olczyk remained at least six feet apart.

Viewers can donate by texting “Help4ChiCovid” to 41444 or visit NBCSportsChicago.com/BeChicago. All proceeds will go to the Chicago Community COVID-19 Response Fund, which has raised more than $25 million for the region’s most vulnerable residents.

NBC Sports Chicago’s goal is to “raise the most amount of money we possibly can.”

“We’re in sports and part of being in sports just by the very nature of that business is you’re used to keeping score,” said Cross, who also said NBC and Comcast have already made “sizable” donations to the fund. “And I think it’s important to keep score but I’ve told the folks don’t worry about the score, just do the best you can to reach the most amount of people.”",1
1296,1299,1731,Obama’s Ambassador To Beijing Compares Trump To Hitler On Chinese TV,"Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, American leftists have been repeatedly caught parroting the rhetoric of the CCP as they decried President Trump’s use of the term “Chinese Virus” as racist while amplifying unfounded claims that President Trump is solely responsible for all of the deaths in the US, despite the growing body of evidence that the coronavirus was spreading in the US even earlier than initially believed (the first known death has been dated to Feb. 6 in California, which suggests the virus was likely spreading in the US before the end of January).

As a reminder, China didn’t inform the world about the evidence of human to human transmission (which they likely possessed for 6+ weeks at that point) until Jan. 22.

Despite all of this, Democrats have taken a distinctly “soft on China” tack, in opposition to President Trump’s increasing hawkishness, even going so far as to side with the CCP (which, remember, just put 1 million+ Muslims into concentration camps) over the White House, as the National Review pointed out in a recent article.

494,494,606,Campaign organizing involves personal connections. Digital teams are trying to adapt amid coronavirus,"Six months out from the general election, the coronavirus continues to impact voters across the country regardless of party affiliation. Safety precautions forced Democratic and Republican organizers to rapidly transition operations to 100% virtual and, in some cases, in a matter of days.

Social distancing measures that have been implemented in response to the pandemic could delay a return to traditional political organizing for the foreseeable future or change them forever. As a result, the Democratic and Republican National Committees, various state parties, and political training organizations have been forced to rely on digital platforms to engage voters in more creative ways.

Party leaders and digital directors told CBS News they have had to adjust in different ways to digital organizing, including teaching volunteers how to use phone banking apps via Zoom, using the same platform to onboard and train volunteers, and hosting digital one-on-one coffee meet-ups between organizers and voters.

NDTC training

According to the RNC, in the weeks since they've gone fully virtual in their operation, they have held nearly 3,900 Trump Victory Leadership Initiative training sessions and more than 1,700 MAGA meet-ups. The committee also noted that they've made more than 20 million voter contacts and have added more than 300,000 new volunteers to their team since making the virtual transition.

""Modern campaigns are all done with digital and through apps,"" said RNC and Trump Victory spokesperson Rick Gorka, who added that being able to phone bank from home creates flexibility for volunteers. ""For us, it's just that that virtual campaign has been a part of what we've done throughout this [and] since the 2016 cycle.""

At the same time, the DNC digital unit has worked to help different departments move online and at the beginning of April, the committee announced in a memo that there had been nearly 7,000 individuals trained on digital organizing tools in the span of a few weeks through the committee's Digital Organizing 101 training sessions. Through partnerships with state parties in battleground states like Florida and Georgia, the committee has sent 2.8 million text messages to voters encouraging them to vote by mail. And the DNC has embedded 11 digital organizing fellows in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

""Organizing at its core is just relationship-building. I think digital organizing is like that as well. How connected does a supporter feel to us and how much of the party do they feel like is their own,"" said DNC Digital Organizing director Meg DiMartino. ""The thing I think about often is how do we continue to deepen and build that online …what are more ways that our supporters, our volunteers can feel more ownership over this program.""

NDTC training

Democrats only recently wrapped up a historically crowded presidential primary, with more than two dozen candidates vying for the nomination. After Joe Biden became the presumptive nominee in April, the Democratic Party immediately announced it would be using its resources to help his campaign scale up quickly. This came as the Biden campaign also had to shift all campaign efforts online. Organizing teams have remained engaged using Zoom to host action events like writing letters and creating signs for first responders. The campaign has also held community calls to check in with how volunteers and supporters are doing during the pandemic.

CBS News attended virtual training sessions with the DNC, RNC, and National Democratic Training Committee, to observe how the campaigns are engaging with voters behind closed doors. Training sessions with as many as 300 participants allowed people to tune in from home offices, living rooms, kitchens or even bedrooms. Volunteers of all ages intently stared at computer screens as hosts drilled down using PowerPoint presentations that lasted 10 to 45 minutes. One of the training sessions featured voters from at least seven different states, another had a steady stream of questions from participants that would show up as blinking notifications in the ""Comments"" section. After presentations, participants were sent handouts, and in some cases, had the opportunity to practice their newly-acquired skills with the trainer on the line.

""These virtual trainings are so easy. And you're actually able to do a lot more of them because you're not traveling from location to location,"" said Florida Republican Party chairman Joe Gruters, who gave remarks during a recent RNC virtual training. ""It's the exact same thing that you would do whether you see them in person, or you could do it over the phone because it's all about getting people set up on the system that they could use in their own homes to make those calls.""

ON THE GROUND FROM COAST TO COAST

Officials from both parties and training organizations insist that digital migration has been made easier because they were already in the process of putting infrastructure in place. CBS News spoke with a dozen Democratic and Republican state parties to survey how the shift to digital has impacted their operations.

""With all the technology that's available…we've done an incredible amount of voter contacts,"" Gruters said. He added that his team has made 4.5 million calls since going fully digital. ""We're hitting all of our numbers and the great thing about what we're able to do is when people are at home because of this crisis, you essentially have a captive audience.""

""One thing that's really interesting is, switching to virtual has actually allowed the team to connect more with rural voters,"" said Iowa Republican Party Communications Director Aaron Britt. He pointed out that rural voters helped President Trump win in 2016, saying ""that's been one of the great offsets especially here in Iowa, the uptick that we've seen in being able to connect with those rural voters as we make a lot of phone calls and things like that.""

Colorado Republican Party Communications director Joe Jackson noted that in his state, a one-size-fits-all approach does not work in both rural and urban areas, so they transitioned events starting at the county party level. When they did their caucuses and assembly, decisions were made at the local level within the governor's guidelines, leaving some counties to conduct drive-through caucuses while others did Zoom meetings or emails.

For Democrats, multiple state parties are trying to maintain high voter engagement. In many states where there was record voter turnout in primaries before the coronavirus pandemic, people have since been forced to shelter in place.

In late April, the North Carolina Democratic Party had record turnout during its county conventions, which were held virtually using Zoom for the first time. Normally, the conventions would have used a county-by-county approach, but because of the pandemic, the party centralized training and coordination to ensure the conventions ran smoothly. Officials and campaigns have also been using texting, phone banking, and holding virtual events and organizing communities online.

""Notwithstanding the challenge, I believe we are more organized and more focused than ever before,"" said NCDP Chair Wayne Goodwin. ""We had no choice but to do that.""

The Michigan Democratic party said it recruited more than 3,000 volunteers and made more than 60,000 direct voter contact calls in the first month of distancing. The party has continued to interview and train organizers, with a goal of having 70 in the state by the end of May. The Organizing Corps program, which trains college students, will be hosting a virtual bootcamp to train a third wave of organizers in the next few weeks for organizing in Michigan.

""We continue to grow this ground game,"" said MDP Chair Lavora Barnes. The 2020 organizing efforts have been underway since 2017. ""It's currently virtual organizers and a lot of these tools that we're using now, we'll continue to use even if or when we're able to get back out and knock on doors and stand on folks' porches and have conversations with them.""

Florida Democratic Party executive director Juan Peñalosa said they've already begun to implement contingency plans if the party has to continue digital organizing through November.

""I think now more than ever, when people vote in November, they're going to think about who helped them, who was there for them during this pandemic, through this crisis. And we've inserted that question into every aspect of our organizing program,"" said Peñalosa. ""Voters today are worried about their health, their jobs, home schooling, their kids. They're lonely and frustrated and good campaigns meet people where they are and our campaign is focused on meeting people where they are. So all of our outreach begins with a wellness check.""

In late March, the Texas Democratic Party launched a series of new programs. Those programs include an online community hub called ConnectTexas, a network of check-in calls across every county called Connect254 and a Community Captains program that has already recruited nearly 500 people. In a state without online voter registration, the party also launched a website in late April to facilitate getting registration forms and postage into the hands of new voters.

Before the pandemic crippled the country, the Texas Democratic Party told CBS News it was planning to put up to 1,000 field organizers and canvassers on the ground in the state as part of their effort to turn Texas from red to blue. At the time, more than 2 million voters participated in the state's Democratic presidential primary, and the party said its organizing operation would be the biggest in the state party's and perhaps Texas history. CBS News learned in a followup last week that the goal has not changed — it's just significantly shifted online.

""That's what organizing and campaigning are, you have to be willing to pivot, but you want to be clear, what we're doing now is aligned with what we planned to do which is building relationships, building connections,"" said Texas Democratic Party organizing director Olivia Stitilis.

DIGITAL GROWING PAINS

While field operations across the country have jumped into online organizing head on, the reliance on technology has not been without adjustments. In South Carolina, the state Democratic Party has worked with counties to hold virtual conventions for the past month. And original plans to hire a significant field staff have changed for the time being.

""We're analyzing the way we're going to have our state convention, we're doing our executive committee meetings completely differently…so there's been a completely re-organization as to how you organize, but also how you go about doing the perfunctory business of running the state party,"" said SCDP Chairman Trav Robertson. ""There's a portion of it that you anticipate doing as everything goes to a digital type of platform or campaign but I mean, the majority of this is a result of COVID-19.""

Training organizations like the National Democratic Training Committee and the conservative Leadership Institute have added online courses to help down ballot candidates and people who are interested in public policy to navigate campaigns and voter engagement during the pandemic.

""Campaigns are naturally risk-averse and late adopters of technology...for a variety of reasons,"" said National Democratic Training Committee CEO Kelly Deitrich. ""[Texting] is not normally a technology that down ballot campaigns with limited time, money and people invest in. They're out knocking on doors. Well, they don't have that option anymore. They're forced to adopt these new ways of communicating and reaching voters that wouldn't have been their first choice, but now may be their only choice.""

""I wouldn't say the goals have changed, I would say the relevant topics have changed,"" said Ron Nehring, who has worked at the Leadership Institute for five years. ""We're still teaching political technology but we're teaching in subjects that we haven't had to cover before. We've never had to do a program on 'how do you keep your campaign alive during a pandemic.""",1
169,169,231,"Former fat guy’s hard-won wisdom on staying healthy, fit despite coronavirus limits","These are not normal times. So we need to cut ourselves a little slack when it comes to our expectations regarding healthy routines.

As someone who’s struggled with his weight his entire life — during the past five years, I’ve managed to lose, and keep off, 80 pounds — I offer a few thoughts for how to focus on your physical health in an age of coronavirus and social distancing.

Also, I’ve been working from home for more than five years. So I know a thing or two about making sure you’re not raiding the fridge and cupboards at every possible opportunity.

I’m not a medical professional. I was a pretty fat guy, though, so I also know a thing or two about defeating old habits, developing better ones and getting into a successful routine.

And I spent three years working on my latest book, “Big Problems: A Former Fat Guy’s Look At Why We’re Getting Fatter And What You Can Do To Fix It” (TarcherPerigree, $17), which came out Tuesday.

For the book, I interviewed doctors, body builders, trainers, nutritionists, marathon runners and more, I tried bodybuilding, long-distance running, powerlifting and even spin classes, CrossFit and yoga, to try to answer a few incredibly complex questions:

Why is it so hard to lose weight? Why is it so easy to get overweight? And what does it mean to be healthy?

With that in mind, here are some tips to help you deal with your health, eating habits and anxiety during this acceptably scary time.

Shoot for good enough, not perfection

It’s hard to have a successful routine regarding your physical health even when there isn’t a global pandemic. That’s why you should feel OK if you aren’t doing a zillion things. It’s OK to not eat “perfect.” (Perfection with your eating is a myth, by the way. There is no perfect meal. OK, maybe a pepperoni-and-sausage pan pizza from Pequod’s.)

Instead, focus on everything being good enough. Have a good enough workout (if you choose to exercise). Have a good enough meal.

Good enough right now is actually quite great.

Make a plan, do your best to follow it

If you’re concerned about your health during the lockdown, or just want to get in better shape — feel free to define this however you like, by the way — you need to make a plan. A goal without a plan is just a wish. So figure out what you’d like to work on. And some kind of structure right now is incredibly important.

If you’re concerned about eating too much while in lockdown mode, write out a meal plan that matches your goals. This can be as simple as deciding what you’re going to eat that day for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Then, you just do the plan. And try to do it good enough.

What about when you wander through the kitchen and see some goldfish crackers? Maybe you should have six handfuls? Well, go back to the plan. Did you plan for goldfish crackers? No? Then, try to not eat ‘em.

Want to exercise more or keep up some kind of existing routine? Write down what your plan is. (I’m not going to tell you how to get into exercise. My book has a lot of options on that. Also, if you Google “home workouts” you’ll find 9,174 YouTube videos that are a great start.)

Once you’ve written down your plan, try your best to follow it. If it sucks and you hate it, look up a new kind of workout to do. The best workout is the one you’ll do consistently. And if you actually like what you’re doing, odds are you’ll do it more.

If you’re just starting and haven’t regularly done exercise before, ease into it. Do less than you think you should. That’ll make it more enjoyable in the long run, trust me.

When I began lifting weights five years ago, I started in my apartment for months, using cheap dumbbells I got on Craigslist and a crappy bench that smelled like feet before moving on to a gym and also running outdoors.

Now that the gym is closed, I “lift weights” three days a week at home using cables and small dumbbells and my body weight and also go on medium-length runs two or three days a week. It’s not perfect — but it’s good enough, especially now.

Am I planning on competing in a strength competition or bodybuilding competition or a marathon in the next few months? Uh, no. Neither are you. So whatever you’re doing, it’s good enough.

Don’t want to do strenuous exercise? Try walking! One recent large-scale study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that for every 4,000 steps a person took, regardless of their speed, their risk of dying from cancer, heart disease or anything else drops by at least 50 percent.

Just like with other endeavors, even if it’s walking, write down your plan, then try to stick to it.

For parents reading this, I know you’re being asked to do your regular job and be a teacher right now, so adding another daily task is daunting. But you need to take time to focus on yourself, too. You could always create a family workout time, even just a neighborhood walk, helping you complete your goals and your kids burn off some energy.

Focus on your mental health

One of the biggest things I discovered in my research is how much mental health plays a role in physical health. And if you are suffering from obesity currently, there’s a good chance you’re also dealing with anxiety, depression or both.

When your mental health is out of whack, it’s sometimes a full plate just to get out of bed, go to work and be productive. Trying to add other things on top of that — developing better eating habits, an exercise routine, writing that vampire-alien-werewolf-love-triangle stage play — can just be too much.

So if you don’t have the mental bandwidth to do more than you’re doing, that’s OK. Anyone who tells you differently is lying or probably has some fake productivity tool they’re trying to sell. We’re all already doing so much, and you should be proud of yourself just for making it through the day.

On this front, it might be good to not focus nonstop on the news. It can be stressful. For some, that stress can trigger overeating. Set timers for your daily social media usage and news consumption — basically a media diet. Getting your information in bigger chunks might be better than snacking throughout the day, just like with food.

Many mental health providers are offering teletherapy during the lockdown. And you can reach out to friends and family and do this thing people used to do way back in the 1990s: talk on the phone.

I just did a virtual Zoom “book party” to celebrate my launch and had people from across the country (and Canada) join in. I’ve had friends who’ve held virtual dinner parties (they all tried to make the same recipe), some who’ve had birthday parties, and one of my buddies attended a virtual wedding.

Community and connection are as important now as they were before COVID-19.

Get more sleep

Studies show you need seven to eight hours of sleep a night. Any less leads to cognitive impairment, which makes it harder to stick with good habits you’ve set up.

Whenever I hear someone say “I only need two hours of sleep to hashtag grind and be perfect!” what I am hearing someone actually say is I am a big liar. Nobody’s functioning at 100 percent if they’re sleep-deprived.

And right now we’re all dealing with more stress than we’re used to. People we know are losing their jobs and their lives. Whenever I feel any slight ailment, I worry that I’ve gotten sick. I’m concerned for my neighbors, for the businesses around me and their workers, everyone.

Getting enough sleep can help your mental health immensely. It also helps you to make healthier decisions.

If you’re mentally fatigued or physically tired, of course, you’ll eat an entire bag of sour cream and onion chips (the height of Midwestern culinary luxury) instead of making a healthier meal. If you’re tired, it’s also a lot easier to say, “I’m just too exhausted to exercise today, so I’ll do it tomorrow.” And then the next thing you know, whatever healthy routines you’ve built are gone. And you have to start over again.

In the end, we’re going to get through this. I think we’re all going to be much more empathetic than we were. You already see people coming together, helping those in need, acting selflessly.

Just remember to be good to yourself, too. This is a rough time. Nobody’s going through this perfectly. And if you had some good habits before the lockdown and they’ve kinda slid to the side, hey, maybe that’s what you need right now.

Love yourself and others. You’re doing a great job.

Republicans say they're moving ahead with plans to gather tens of thousands of people at their presidential nominating convention in North Carolina this summer — even as Democrats weigh their options for convening during the coronavirus pandemic.

In a statement Saturday marking 100 days to go before the 2020 Republican National Convention, the Republican National Committee said it is expecting nearly 50,000 attendees, including delegates and members of the media, at the convention scheduled for the week of Aug. 24 in Charlotte.

And in an op-ed published Friday for Fox Business, convention President and CEO Marcia Lee Kelly said Republicans are preparing to gather ""thousands"" to mark the formal renomination of President Trump and Vice President Pence to lead the party's 2020 ticket. She said organizers are working on details including the carpet and lighting at the convention.

Kelly said convention planners have ""recognized that large-scale events would need to look different in light of COVID-19.""

Kelly did not specify how the convention would be different because of the virus, though she told Fox that organizers would follow guidelines from federal, state and local authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She noted that the RNC has hired Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge — a physician, former medical director for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and former chairman of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — to oversee health and safety planning for the convention.

In an interview with NPR member station WFAE on Thursday, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said the RNC is committed to holding the convention in Charlotte, while adding that it's possible attendees may wear masks or hold some events in smaller venues or outside.

City leaders in Charlotte have been divided over how to move forward with convention planning given the public health threat. Some city council members in the heavily Democratic community have expressed fears that gathering thousands of people in a relatively small area could prompt a surge in COVID-19 cases. The city remains under a stay-at-home order and has limited mass gatherings to no more than 10 people.

And some Republicans, including North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, have cast doubt on the feasibility of moving ahead as planned. Tillis has said that hosting the party's convention could be ""very difficult"" under these circumstances.

In an interview this week with the Washington Examiner, Trump reiterated his determination to hold the convention, saying, ""I think we'll be in good shape by that time."" However, the president said he was concerned about the possibility of North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, ""playing politics"" with the convention. Cooper is running for reelection this year and, like every governor, is charged with making decisions about how quickly to reopen the state during the pandemic.

Meanwhile, Democrats have delayed the Democratic National Convention, originally planned for the week of July 13 in Milwaukee, pushing it back to the week of Aug. 17 — one week prior to the RNC. Party leaders have been exploring options for safely holding an event where former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to be officially named the party's nominee amidst the pandemic.

Democrats have already taken steps to allow delegates to participate remotely and are exploring other contingency plans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has tossed out suggestions that include shortening the convention or spacing out attendees in a ""gigantic stadium.""

In an interview with NPR, the Democratic convention's chief executive, Joe Solmonese, said it's too soon for organizers to know exactly how plans will need to be adjusted because of the virus.

""How many people we do that in front of, how many hotel rooms we occupy in the city of Milwaukee, how many buses and what sort of security infrastructure we end up having in terms of the uncertainty of the public health environment remains to be seen,"" Solmonese said.",1
460,460,565,"Shop Class, Over Zoom","CTE is one of the few areas of public education that has consistent bipartisan support among federal lawmakers, and it’s also favored by the public in national education polls. Massachusetts is one of a growing number of states boosting its investment in CTE: In recent years, it has distributed more than $78 million in grants to help expand CTE programs, including more classroom seats to accommodate students training for high-demand jobs.

The district has the resources for Essex Tech to adapt relatively quickly to remote learning; the school provided students with laptops or iPads at the start of the academic year, and administrators say they’ve been able to help families in need get access to mobile hotspots for internet service. The school’s leadership team also put together a thorough blueprint detailing processes and expectations for students and staff while distance learning is the norm, something teachers and parents say has eased the transition.

Not every CTE school will have the same supports to fall back on, Jarrod Nagurka, a spokesperson for the national Association for Career and Technical Education, told me. But CTE’s emphasis on creative problem-solving could help students and teachers adjust more swiftly to this new reality, Nagurka said. “We’re seeing an incredible amount of resourcefulness,” he said.

That’s been the case for Massachusetts’s CTE community more widely, which has responded rapidly to the remote-learning situation, Kevin Farr, the executive director of the Massachusetts Association of Vocational Administrators, told me. Teachers from the state’s 56 vocational programs are sharing lessons, video lectures, and ideas for activities. “We’re going to provide a solid bank of online resources from all over the country, as well as the state,” Farr said. “We have to fill that gap until we can get our kids back to school, and back to the hands-on piece.”

In the meantime, being forced to adapt to distance learning means that schools such as Essex Tech have a chance to reimagine how CTE is taught, which could be a boon for communities where the cost of building and outfitting specialized schools is an issue or for rural areas where in-person classes aren’t possible. “Necessity does breed invention, and this situation we’re all facing certainly qualifies as necessity,” Robin Lake, the director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington, told me. “We’re very eager to watch what kinds of solutions people come up with and what kind of evidence we can collect to see which approaches work better than others.”

For Benouardia, the Essex Tech freshman, the forced transition to remote learning has been both challenging and rewarding. Her classroom is now the two-story house that she shares with her parents, three siblings, and grandmother. The family’s internet service has slowed down considerably with more people at home, and for some classes the workload is heavier than when school was open. There have been perks, too, such as setting her own schedule, and assignments like the litter survey. “That was the best homework I’ve ever had,” Benouardia told me. “I learned a lot from it about my neighborhood and the people who live around me. That’s going to stick with me.”

60,60,100,FDA Seeks To Expand Treatment For Coronavirus As Part Of White House Response,"FDA Seeks To Expand Treatment For Coronavirus As Part Of White House Response

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Updated at 3:37 p.m. ET

The Food and Drug Administration is trying to clear the way to expand the types of medicines or treatments available during the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump said Thursday.

Early trials have begun for a prospective coronavirus vaccine, and the FDA also is working to permit patients to have access to medicines approved for use in other countries or for other uses.

FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn stressed that the agency is moving as quickly as it can while still following protocol to ensure safety standards are met.

The White House briefing comes as the administration continues to ramp up its response to the virus, including providing economic relief and mobilizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Trump met with governors about their needs.

Trump also said Thursday that he would support the prospect of the government taking an equity stake in companies as part of a big stimulus for the economy.

The particulars are being negotiated in Congress as part of another bill that could lead to hundreds of billions or $1 trillion in cash or other support for individual Americans, small business and big companies.

Trump's answer on Thursday suggested that he would be open to a situation in which the government might buy a percentage of the stock of a big company in order to provide it with equity to continue operating through the economic shock associated with the pandemic.

Trump said the amount of spending would depend on the virus.

If social distancing and the clinical response could stop the coronavirus ""in its tracks,"" about $1 trillion would be ""plenty,"" the president said. If that won't do, more negotiations might be required.

FDA fast track

FDA officials want to expand the treatments available during the pandemic in a way that's both fast and responsible, Trump said, so that authorities can monitor what works as soon as practical.

""Immediately — like, as fast as we can get it,"" the president said.

Trump said the measures he announced on Thursday could be a ""game-changer,"" but ""maybe not.""

Hahn, of the FDA, said he wanted to assure Americans that the agency would work as fast as it could to broaden access to new medicines and treatment but that it remained bound by its mission to ensure that those products would be safe.

""We are looking at everything that's coming across our desks as treatment options for coronavirus,"" Hahn said. ""We need to make sure this sea of treatments will get the right drug to the right patient at the right dosage at the right time.""

One first step in the short term, Hahn said, is to examine medications already in use for other purposes.

Doctors will look at an anti-malaria drug, for example, to see how it might be applied to coronavirus sufferers, he said. Another option might be to take blood from patients who've recovered from a coronavirus infection and inject it into sick patients to help their immune response.

Hahn said the FDA's work would be a ""continuous process"" and might take three to six months. A vaccine might not be complete for about a year.

Overall, it was not clear on Thursday that beyond officials' emphasis on doing lots of assessments quickly, when the work that has begun would start to pay off at significant scale.

""This is an unprecedented situation,"" Hahn said. ""This is a really significant time.""

More testing

Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus coordinator, told reporters in the same briefing that she recognized that the number of coronavirus cases in the United States would likely continue to rise as more tests become available and it takes less time to process them.

The number of infections has topped 10,000, as of Thursday afternoon, according to the latest reports.

Birx said the rate of positive results is between 10 and 11%, meaning that about 90% of people receiving tests don't have the coronavirus.

Even so, a more robust testing regime likely will reveal more cases, officials said.

Conference with governors

Trump traveled from the White House to the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday. He spoke with a group of governors about the need to be able to care for what is expected to be a wave of people needing treatment for the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

FEMA is accustomed to responding when natural disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes overwhelm local resources, but the scope and scale of the coronavirus pandemic presents huge logistical challenges.

Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp told Trump to ""leave the directives for the National Guard with the governors.""

Responded Trump: ""That's done. I like it.""

Kemp also asked Trump to consider maintaining staff at a military base used for quarantining cruise ship passengers in order to handle people from the metro Atlanta area.

Louisiana's Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards said he was worried that his state's medical facilities would be overwhelmed in a week. Edwards said the state would like to be able to send some patients to a hospital run by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Trump said he would work to approve that quickly.

Vice President Pence urged governors to place orders for N95 masks after a new change to liability laws made it possible for hospitals to use industrial masks, normally targeted for construction sites.

Pence also told governors that a survey was being done to determine the supply of ventilators. Birx, the response coordinator, urged them to ensure that coronavirus test results are reported centrally so that supplies can be surged to the right areas.

Nebraska's Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts said he was concerned about the supply of reagents for processing tests.

Ricketts also said there was an urgent need for ""pop-up alternative day care,"" especially for first responders and health care workers. He asked Trump for assistance with streamlining the process of clearing day care workers.

""We need a waiver from the fingerprint requirement to be able to do that quickly,"" he said.

Ricketts also asked that the Education Department relax ""free appropriate education"" requirements because recent guidelines created concerns. He said some school attorneys have told teachers they cannot teach because they could be sued under those ""appropriate education"" requirements.

Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Charlie Baker said his state has put in orders for personal protective equipment supplies, as Trump had previously directed. But he suggested the federal government was crowding out other buyers.

""On three big orders, we lost to the feds,"" Baker said, asking Trump to look into the issue.

Maryland's Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said the federal government should give at least half of stimulus aid funding to the states, saying that state government could get money out faster to where it's needed.

Pressure for results

Trump is under pressure to show that his administration has the situation in hand as Americans see their day-to-day lives dramatically change.

Schools are closed, people are heeding warnings to stay away from others, and many have lost their income as the economy has been shocked to a near-halt.

Meanwhile, Trump's administration is negotiating with Congress on a new package of aid to help people and businesses through the huge economic losses from the crisis. It will be the third round of aid in two months. Trump signed the second package into law Wednesday night.

But the virus is making it hard for lawmakers to do their work.

On Wednesday evening, two congressmen said they had tested positive for the virus, and others who had met with them — including Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 2 Republican in the House — said they would self-quarantine, to be safe.

No decision on Olympics, Trump says

Trump acknowledged at the White House that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe discussed the upcoming Summer Olympics, set to occur in Tokyo, in a call with world leaders earlier this week.

Abe hasn't decide whether to cancel the games, Trump said, but ""we'd live with his decision if he does.""

Trump was asked on Thursday when he thought life would get back to normal.

""I hope very soon,"" he said. ""We'll see. This is uncharted territory.""",1
80,80,121,Coronavirus Threatens Rural Hospitals Already At The Financial Brink,"Coronavirus Threatens Rural Hospitals Already At The Financial Brink

Rural hospitals may not be able to keep their doors open as the coronavirus pandemic saps their cash, their CEOs warn, just as communities most need them.

As the coronavirus sweeps across the United States, all hospitals are facing cancellations of doctor visits and procedures by a terrified populace — profitable services that usually help fund hospitals. Meanwhile, the institutions also find themselves needing to pay higher prices for personal protective equipment such as face masks and other gear that's in short supply. Vice President Mike Pence called on hospitals nationwide Wednesday to delay elective surgeries to free up capacity and resources for future coronavirus patients.

The American Hospital Association responded Thursday by asking Congress for $100 billion for all hospitals to offset coronavirus costs, citing rural hospitals' inability to withstand huge losses for long.

""If we're not able to address the short-term cash needs of rural hospitals, we're going to see hundreds of rural hospitals close before this crisis ends,"" warned Alan Morgan, the head of the National Rural Health Association, which represents 21,000 health care providers and hospitals. ""This is not hyperbole.""

Well before the COVID-19 threat, rural health care's profitability had collapsed nationwide due to a combination of narrowing Medicare reimbursements, a larger share of patients lacking high-paying private insurance and the hollowing out of rural America. Given such pressures, more than 120 rural hospitals have been forced to close over the past decade.

Those hospitals in small-town America that have survived rely heavily on moneymakers such as elective surgeries, physical therapy and lab tests to make their razor-thin margins work. But, according to the Chicago-based Chartis Center for Rural Health, almost half of them still operate in the red.

So the added financial hit from the coronavirus outbreak could be the final straw for many rural hospitals — exposing the complicated business dynamics at play within the United States' critical public health infrastructure.

""This virus, and what it is causing for these hospitals, is the perfect storm that will close these hospitals at a time this country critically needs them,"" says Robin Rau, CEO of Miller County Hospital in southwestern Georgia. ""This is going to be the death blow to them.""

Two weeks ago, she started eliminating all medical services that were not urgent. She estimates that has cut off at least half of the hospital's revenue. Other CEOs warned similar cuts at their hospitals mean they won't make payroll in the coming weeks.

The National Rural Health Association, along with many rural hospital executives, is lobbying for immediate cash assistance, no-interest loans, Medicare reimbursement adjustments and other suggestions to alleviate the pain. The association favors a bailout plan from Sens. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and Michael Bennet, D-Colo., which in early drafts called for the equivalent of a three-month advance based on hospitals' previous patient numbers, according to Bennet's office.

""Rural hospitals have already been closing their doors at startling rates, and this crisis will only exacerbate that fact,"" Bennet tells KHN in a written statement. ""There is an incredible opportunity for rural hospitals to shoulder some of the burdens of caring for patients and helping to meet possible bed shortages.""

Still, many rural hospital CEOs worry any assistance may come too late.

""And yet I hear they're going to bail out the cruise lines? Really?"" Missouri's Scotland County Hospital CEO Dr. Randy Tobler says.

As Tobler looks at his older, sicker, underinsured patient population, he says he is afraid the hospital, located on the state's northeastern rural border, might last only until May before running out of money for payroll.

""In the truly safety-net areas, we're being called to high duty,"" he says. ""And we're running on fumes.""

Michael Purvis, CEO of Candler County Hospital in Metter, Ga., says he's already fallen into a negative cash flow situation in the past week. The number of patients coming to his hospital, which is about 65 miles outside Savannah, for profitable outpatient procedures has dropped by half as people in droves have canceled their surgeries, MRIs and physical therapy. Purvis has implemented fever checks of people at the entrance. But he remains fearful that his billing staff could be forced to quarantine themselves if they fall ill — effectively shutting off the hospital's revenue.

""If my billers and coders stay healthy, I can make it to April, maybe end of June,"" Purvis says.

On top of the massive loss of revenue, Julie Jones, CEO at Community Hospital-Fairfax in northwestern Missouri, says she can only get specialty N95 respirator masks that offer critical protection for her front-line providers for about $5 each — more than 16 times the normal cost of 30 cents.

Angela Ammons, CEO of Clinch Memorial Hospital in Homerville, Ga., says she has warned staff that if hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes continue to go missing, she'll watch the video footage and fire on the spot anyone caught stealing supplies. And she is so worried about running out of protective equipment, she's asking any of her ""crafty"" staff with sewing machines to sew cotton masks.

""I would rather staff go in with a fabric mask than no mask at all,"" she says.

To be sure, rural hospitals are not as equipped as larger hospital systems to handle the most serious coronavirus cases. Many are not outfitted with ICUs or enough doctors and staff to handle multiple intensive care patients. That means they have to transfer those patients to larger hospitals.

Still, rural experts argue that their bed and health care capacity can be leveraged to keep potential coronavirus cases out of the major hospitals. Plus, rural facilities could be places for initial triage or eventual recovery care.

And if nothing changes, Rau worries, the country is about to lose this critical public health infrastructure.

""We can talk all we want about the cost of health care in this country in this ridiculous health care system we have,"" she says. ""But at a time like this, who for a minute would think about getting rid of rural hospitals?""

201,201,271,"When the spotlight returns to Biden, here’s hoping he calls on our better angels","Queen Elizabeth II’s speech to the United Kingdom was moving, even for those of us who are lifelong small-r republicans.

In some respects, her model cannot be copied in the United States. She is a monarch, and we had some disagreements about that matter in 1776. She is a living link to the most harrowing experience in living memory, the Second World War. And, at 92, she has accumulated a lifetime’s reservoir of trust and goodwill.

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

But the queen’s address does have lessons for us Yanks, and particularly for Joe Biden. Part of what made the queen’s speech affecting was its theme of unity. She didn’t speak to the people so much as for the people.

She thanked, first of all, the health care workers and other essential employees who “selflessly continue their day-to-day duties outside the home in support of us all.” Next, she extended her thoughts to those remaining in their homes and caring for loved ones. “Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it.”

In a nod to Winston Churchill’s iconic “finest hour” speech, she offered a tribute to the nation’s character:

“I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humored resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterize this country. The pride in who we are is not a part of our past, it defines our present and our future.”

We’ve heard that at stressful times, people want a strong leader, and that this accounts for the rally-around-the-flag effect so evident in opinion polls worldwide. Even Donald Trump has benefited, at least a little, from this reaction. But that isn’t the whole story.

Trying times also bring out people’s altruism and longing for unity. In my own circle, among friends, relatives and the neighborhood Listserv, offers of help, volunteering and contributions have overflowed. Neighbors volunteer to shop for elderly residents. Teenagers offer to help younger kids with homework via Zoom.

One person posted that she cannot cut her lawn because she hurt her foot. Another responded immediately, “I would be elated to mow your lawn since that’s what I do for work and I’ve got nothing better to do.”

Companies large and small have stepped up to donate supplies to health care workers, churches and others are caring for children whose parents are essential workers. Blood collection centers are crowded with donors. The list is nearly endless.

We’ve focused so much in recent years on the primitive side of our natures — the part that responds to tribalism and hatred of “out” groups. But while those traits are real enough, we didn’t achieve great civilizations by suspicion alone. Cooperation and, in Queen Elizabeth’s phrase, “fellow feeling,” is also part of our nature. Without cooperation, we’d still be wandering the savannah in groups of 15 or 20 with spears in one hand and babies on our backs.

Humans are cooperative creatures — even, at times, selfless ones. In wartime, men throw themselves on grenades to save others. In this time of plague, doctors and nurses willingly put their own lives at risk to save people they don’t even know.

Americans are already behaving in cooperative and unifying ways. What they lack is a voice. President Donald Trump is utterly incapable of sounding those notes. When he attempts it, as, for example, when an aide draws up some uplifting rhetoric, he seems to be sounding out the words as if reading another language. He is far more comfortable searching out enemies — the media, his predecessor, the “deep state,” underappreciative governors, General Motors and so forth.

Joe Biden, by contrast, is well-suited to the unifier role. His strength is a sympathetic understanding of others’ pain. His instincts are toward conciliation and cooperation, to the point that Democratic partisans were sometimes dismayed when, earlier in this cycle, he reminisced fondly about “getting things done” with Republicans.

Just now, in the midst of the crisis, Biden lacks an opportunity to voice a unifying message. But that time will come soon. He should seize it. It comes naturally to him. It would remind us of our better angels, and the country is yearning for it.

786,786,955,"With the focus on the coronavirus, Lightfoot opts for bare-bones capital plan","Singularly focused on the war against the coronavirus, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has opted for a $100 million, bare bones capital plan — bankrolled by an existing line of credit — to pay for new vehicles, sidewalks and the treasured aldermanic menu program.

Normally, the city issues general obligation bonds backed by property taxes to cover a more sweeping capital program. But these are not normal times.

The Lightfoot administration is preoccupied with the city’s response to the coronavirus and the budget crisis triggered by the stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy.

So the decision was made to proceed only with those capital projects and purchases that absolutely needed to get done and to finance it with a line of credit that remained, even after Lightfoot saved $22 million by eliminating a $1.4 billion line of credit negotiated by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

The bare-bones capital plan is on the agenda for Monday’s Finance Committee meeting.

It includes: $83 million for the aldermanic menu program; $3 million for the shared sidewalk program; and $13.8 million to replace aging police cars and other city vehicles.

“We were taking applications for the shared sidewalks in January. So those commitments have already been made. We’ve got to get the snow plows ordered. We’ve got to get these police cars traded out. These are standard things that have to happen. And they can’t wait,” said Kristen Cabanban, a spokesperson for the city’s Office of Budget and Management.

And what is so urgent about the aldermanic menu program other than the fact that it’s a sacred cow politically?

“They do things like repair streets. They do a lot of infrastructure improvements too. Those things are important to residents as well,” Cabanban said.

A larger and more traditional general obligation bond issue is still a possibility later this year, Cabanban said. But, she quickly added, “We will need to go back and have that discussion at a different time. Right now, our priority is responding to COVID.”

Still unclear is what, if any, impact the shrunken capital plan will have on the $95 million police academy in West Garfield Park.

Last year, Emanuel got the go-ahead to issue $850 million in general obligation bonds to fund a laundry list of capital improvement projects. It included $65 million for the police and fire training, $30 million short of the original price tag.

Last summer, Lightfoot told reporters that the project that critics called a symbol of Emanuel’s misplaced spending priorities needed to be made bigger, better and, undoubtedly, more expensive.

After touring the old police academy and seeing recruits apprehending mock suspects in a dark hallway, Lightfoot said she was not at all certain that the two-building campus to be built at 4301 W. Chicago Ave. on 30.4 vacant acres was big enough to house a training facility that will be “best-in-class” not just when it opens, but for decades afterward.

“I don’t know that it’s big enough. I don’t know that the plans, particularly on the fire [department] side, are gonna provide them with the different kind of training scenarios that they need,” the mayor told reporters outside the current facility, 1300 W. Jackson Blvd.

“This is gonna be a significant investment on the West Side that desperately needs investment, but if we’re gonna make that kind of investment, I want to get it right. I want it to be the best-in-class training facility for first responders anywhere in the country. That’s what we ought to aspire to.”

Much like Wintrust Arena, the police academy project became a symbol of Emanuel’s misplaced priorities, critics said. For years, it has drawn fire from Chance the Rapper, Black Lives Matter and other groups who have organized under the #NoCopAcademy label.

Emanuel was even confronted by anti-academy protesters on college campus visits to other cities.

Along the cement stars of Hollywood Boulevard, where vendors are normally packed arm to arm hawking maps to the stars, Michael Jackson gloves and the chance to pose with the likes of Johnny Depp, only a single vendor selling masks sat near Ida Lupino’s star hoping for a sale, while the marquee at the El Capitan theater flashed words of encouragement from the likes of “Toy Story” hero Buzz Lightyear such as, “The important thing is that we stick together.”

Further down the street a “Star Wars” stormtrooper looking like he just came off of a movie set skateboarded down Hollywood Boulevard — in the center lane, with no traffic in sight.

Under normal circumstances, there would be no room to skateboard on the sidewalks or the streets anywhere near Hollywood Boulevard, which would be flooded with tour buses and bumper to bumper traffic.

During his press conference, Gov. Newsom said, “At some point in the future, we will need to modify our stay-at-home order. … As we contemplate reopening parts of our state, we must be guided by science and data, and we must understand that things will look different than before.”

409,409,506,"If NHL season resumes in full in July, Blackhawks won’t have much to play for","Early in the coronavirus pandemic, when hundreds of potential scenarios for eventually resuming the 2019-20 season sat on the NHL’s desk, one idea to expand the playoff field piqued a lot of interest in Chicago.

The rationale was that if the league went straight into the postseason whenever hockey returned, bubble teams like the Jets and Blue Jackets would be unfairly denied opportunities to battle for spots down the stretch.

To resolve that injustice, the NHL mentioned potentially expanding the field. The most likely scenario was 10 per conference, but there were whispers of 12 as well — and, lo and behold, the Blackhawks ranked 12th in the West when the season stopped.

The thought that this mediocre-at-best Hawks team — six points out of a real wild card spot, with mere 3.4 percent playoff odds (per Moneypuck) — would get automatically inserted anyway was absurd but exciting.

That was weeks ago, though. Now, there’s growing optimism that the NHL will resume its season in July at one common, neutral location per division — most likely Minnesota for the Central Division — and conclude the regular season in part or full before beginning the playoffs.

That would result in the Stanley Cup being awarded in September, per a Wednesday AP report, and the 2020-21 season probably starting late. Nonetheless, it seems like the most thorough and developed plan yet.

For hockey in general, it’s great news. For the Blackhawks, though, it’s arguably disappointing: it will likely equate to much ado for a few weeks of largely meaningless games, then a return to the same nothingness that has filled April.

The real drama with the Hawks franchise right now lies off the ice, where John McDonough’s Monday firing opened up endless possibilities for the front office.

On the ice, there are approximately zero possibilities: no chance of making the playoffs, no chance of tanking for a top draft pick (barring another lottery miracle).

Corey Crawford, Malcolm Subban and Slater Koekkoek would be playing for new contracts, and Olli Maatta and Zack Smith to avoid juicy potential buyouts. And that’s about it.

Simply having hockey back at all would be rejoiced by the whole league, and the Hawks’ resident hockey nerds — Patrick Kane and Dylan Strome chief among them — would surely enjoy even watching the playoffs.

But as far as motivation to endure another training camp, an unavoidable quarantine away from family and friends and the physical bruising of several weeks of games, the Hawks would be sorely lacking.",1
1257,1259,1659,Chechen Leader Kadyrov Hospitalized With Coronavirus in Moscow: Reports – The Moscow Times,"Doctors reportedly recommended that Kadyrov go to Moscow after his “condition began deteriorating rapidly.”

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has been hospitalized in Moscow with a suspected coronavirus infection, Interfax reported Thursday.

Kadyrov, 43, was reportedly flown to the Russian capital Wednesday, a few days after reporting flu-like symptoms, the Baza Telegram channel reported earlier Thursday. Chechen doctors recommended that Kadyrov seek treatment there after his “condition began deteriorating rapidly,” Baza said.

The Telegram channel cited medical data as saying that Kadyrov has been diagnosed with lung damage and a suspected Covid-19 infection.

“He is under doctors’ supervision,” Interfax cited its source as saying.

A well-known transport tracker said Thursday that a private jet linked to Kadyrov arrived at Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport from the Chechen capital of Grozny.

Kadyrov’s official page on Russian social network Vkontakte has posted several updates in the past 24 hours, including posts on his charitable donations and birthday greetings for Russia’s defense minister, but has not yet addressed his alleged infection.

Kadyrov was last active on his Telegram account on Tuesday, while Instagram blocked his page last week.

1184,1184,1500,TV news adapts as COVID-19 dramatically changes broadcasts,"Huel Perkins still heads into the newsroom and works from 3 p.m. to midnight, five days a week.

Aside from that, ""everything is dramatically different,"" the WJBK-TV (Channel 2) news anchor says of working during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Like every other industry, the TV news business has been upended since mid-March when coronavirus became the story in America. Anchors are separated — sometimes by a newsroom, sometimes by miles — reporters are broadcasting from home and photographers are practicing social distancing guidelines with their subjects.

Newsrooms, once bustling with bodies, have been reduced to skeleton crews, while interviews that would normally take place in-person are now beamed across Skype and Zoom.

Perkins, who is co-anchoring evening broadcasts with an at-home Monica Gayle, says in normal times, he's used to there being anywhere from 225-250 people in Fox 2's Southfield headquarters. Now there's sometimes only four, ""and I'm the fourth,"" he says. ""It's incredible.""

Yet the show goes on. ""We are adapting,"" says Perkins, who has been with Fox 2 for nearly 25 years. ""We’re using our experience to get things done.""

Their efforts are being rewarded in the ratings department.

Viewership is up across the board for local news. At WDIV-TV (Channel 4), numbers from 4-8 p.m. are up 22% from a year ago, and year-to-year, ratings are up 70%, according to the station's vice president and general manager, Marla Drutz.

The rewards come as the various stations have had to employ new ways of working and reporters, producers, editors and on-air personalities have had to learn new skill sets on the fly.

Kevin Jeanes, the morning weatherman at WXYZ-TV (Channel 7), has been working from his Royal Oak home since late March.

In the newsroom, he's used to working off six computers; in his set-up at home, he has two laptops and two iPhones. The monitor he uses to communicate with the station is an old TV that he places in front of him during his morning remotes, which start every weekday at 4:30 a.m. and last through 9 a.m., at a rate of eight or nine per hour.

He's lit by a ring light he bought for $45 off Amazon and he broadcasts via an app on one of his phones from a back corner of his basement, which he outfitted with a few bookcases to look more like a home office and less like, well, the back corner of his basement. While he's doing local weather updates during cutaways from ""Good Morning America,"" his wife and 18-month-old son are upstairs sleeping.

Well, sometimes they're sleeping. ""My son can be kind of loud, and sometimes he'll be banging around upstairs and I know you can hear him on-air,"" Jeanes says. ""Yesterday morning, I changed his diaper during a commercial break.""

WXYZ-TV morning weatherman Kevin Jeanes works from home in Royal Oak. (Photo: Kevin Jeanes)

Jeanes, who's been giving himself haircuts since the lockdown began, also does call-ins with WKQI-FM's (Channel 955) ""Mojo in the Morning"" program; he does those from inside a storage closet, tucked between a mattress and some clothes.

He's making the most of the situation and enjoys being so close to his wife and child during a time of such great worldwide unease. What he misses most about going into the office is the camaraderie of his co-workers.

""It’s a little bit harder to have fun at work,"" Jeanes says. ""You're used to being around the buzz of the newsroom and a lot of people, and now I’m just in this quiet basement all by myself. And when you don't have people around you, it's hard to bring that high energy every morning, which is what people expect.""

Alex Atwell, a photographer for WDIV, is having to learn how to convey energy in his stories in a new way.

Under social distancing guidelines, he's filming interviews from at least six feet away using a long microphone, rather than having subjects fit with a small lavalier microphone, which clips on their shirts and allows for free movement — and with that, more visual possibilities for the Emmy-winning cameraman.

Buy Photo WDIV-TV news videographer Alex Atwell, wearing mask and gloves, works with general assignment reporter Larry Spruill in the parking lot at Channel 4. (Photo: Daniel Mears, The Detroit News)

""For me, the lavalier is key to creative storytelling and active interviews, and that has been taken away,"" says Atwell, who has been with Channel 4 since 2008. ""We all have to think differently try to keep the quality up and be creative in different ways.""

Atwell is used to teaming up with a reporter, talking through a story on the way to an assignment and collaborating on its look and various story elements.

Since the pandemic began, Atwell now rides alone in his news truck and meets up with a reporter, who drives separately, at an assignment; afterward, they use transcription apps to pass files back and forth to each other, rather than working on something together hand-in-hand.

""For the most part, I’m the only one in my truck,"" Atwell says. At the beginning of his shift he spends up to 15 minutes wiping down everything in the truck: the heat shifters, lights, radio, steering wheel, seats, work stations, ""all kinds of other buttons,"" he says. ""You don't realize how many things you touch in a vehicle.""

And Atwell says he's the only person who handles his equipment. Even if it means more trips to and from his van, he'll haul his own tripod, mic stand and camera, and he stays six feet from everyone with whom he interacts.

His main goal, he says, is to limit exposure risk to COVID-19.

""It's an abundance of caution,"" says Atwell, who wears a mask at all times while working in the field. ""When I go out, I assume I have it and I assume the person I’m with has it. I take that mindset.""

From a practical standpoint, one of the biggest obstacles he currently faces is the lack of bathrooms at his disposal. He's used to driving around the city all day hopping between assignments, but now that most businesses are closed, he can't run into a McDonald's or a Starbucks and use the restroom facilities the way he's used to doing.

""You've either gotta hold it all day, or sometimes I can rush home,"" Atwell says.

Buy Photo News videographer Alex Atwell, left, and reporter Larry Spruill are having to cover stories in a new way. (Photo: Daniel Mears, The Detroit News)

Atwell — whose long-running ""Uniquely Detroit"" series, which highlight local citizens, artists and businesses doing positive things in the community, is currently on hold due to the pandemic — is also an example of the way Detroit's TV stations are working together during these unprecedented times. He was the cameraman during the town hall with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on April 2 that was simulcast on Channels 2, 4 and 7.

Fox 2's Perkins anchored that broadcast along with Channel 4's Devin Scillian and Channel 7's Carolyn Clifford. Perkins says the collaboration between the three affiliates was a ""wonderful"" show of solidarity across network and competition lines. ""It was great for the community to see us all working together,"" he says.

Early on during the state's lockdown, Perkins elected to continue to come into the Fox 2 studio and be the familiarity that viewers could find at a time when so much of their lives had been overturned. ""I thought it was important that somebody be there,"" he says.

It hasn't been business as usual. He was initially coming home and sanitizing every piece of clothing he was wearing after his shifts, a process that is no longer as rigorous, he says.

Clockwise from top left: Monica Gayle, Sherry Margolis, Amy Lange, Roop Raj, Huel Perkins and Taryn Asher work from home and the newsroom. (Photo: Fox 2)

On-air, Perkins' Thursday night ""Let It Rip"" segments — which typically feature a panel of guests debating the topics of the day, the more spirited the better — are now conducted remotely, and the slight pauses and delays in connections make it harder to really let it rip. ""It's a conversation,"" Perkins says, ""and in-person is always better.""

Likewise, he's used to sitting next to his co-anchor, but now he'll text Gayle during breaks and downtime during the broadcast.

But he's still there, and that's what's important. The veteran anchor says he's heard from viewers who have told him he's helped make them feel less afraid, which was his intention.

""I want to be that calm, reassuring voice to let the viewers know that yes it's tough, yes it’s difficult, but we’re going to get through this,"" he says. ""It’s going to take some time. Not weeks, not months, maybe a year, but we're starting to realize we’re not going to return to exactly what we were.

""This is going to change our world. In a sense, we will never go back to what we were. But we will find a way through it.""

408,408,504,Michigan Doctor Raided by FBI and Arrested for Treating COVID19 Patients with Vitamin C,"Comments by Brian Shilhavy

Editor, Health Impact News

As we have previously reported here at Health Impact News, doctors all across the world have seen great success in treating COVID-19 patients with high-dose intravenous Vitamin C therapy.

When we first reported on doctors doing this in China just after the Wuhan outbreak, Facebook tagged us as “Fake News” and took away our ability to advertise and boost any of our articles. See:

Since that time, we have reported on how many doctors and hospitals here in the U.S. have also successfully used the treatment. See:

Now, a doctor in Michigan has actually had his clinic raided by the FBI and arrested being accused of “committing health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud” because he treated his patients with Vitamin C.

Michigan Doctor Charged with Felonies for Treating Coronavirus Patients with Vitamin C

by Shane Trejo

Big League Politics

Excerpts:

A Michigan doctor has had his Metro Detroit clinic raided following allegations that he was “illegally” treating coronavirus patients with Vitamin C.

Dr. Charles Mok, who leads the Allure Medical Spa in Shelby Township, has been accused of committing health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud. He is being charged in federal court for these supposed crimes.

Mok is an advocate for treating coronavirus patients with Vitamin C in order to boost their immune systems while they fight off the virus. This has become a controversial notion, as hysteria proponents stand in the way of any treatment that does not involve forcing vaccine shots into millions of people.

Federal jackboots surrounded the Allure facility and raided it last week. They are claiming that his treatments do not qualify for Medicare reimbursements because they have not been rubber-stamped for approval by the Medical Mafia at the FDA. He is also being accused of conducting illegal vein treatment after all “non-essential businesses” were forced to close by an edict from Governor Gretchen Whitmer.

Mok announced on YouTube that “IV vitamin C is being used in hospitals across the country to treat the most advanced disease associated with COVID-19.” This may have prompted the feds to shut down his operation by brute force.

311,311,394,"Illinois still short of COVID-19 testing goal of 10,000 people a day — and even that might be less than what’s needed","More than three weeks after Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state needed to process 10,000 coronavirus tests each day to get ahead of the outbreak gripping Illinois, average daily testing numbers are still 40 percent short of that goal.

While Pritzker and the federal government say the state now has the machines needed to conduct thousands of more tests, a shortage in necessary supplies to actually process those tests has limited how many can actually be completed, officials say.

What’s more, some national projections adjusted for Illinois’ population suggest the state may need to process roughly 15,000 to 900,000 tests a day to be able to confidently chart the next steps toward returning to normal. Some experts say more tests are needed to screen individuals without symptoms who could unwittingly spread the disease and check people who are considered high-risk multiple times.

“We will never, ever get out of the stay-at-home order unless we do massive amounts of testing of those people at highest risk for COVID-19,” said Dr. Howard Ehrman, a former deputy commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health. “If Pritzker takes us out of the stay-at-home order before enough testing is done, either partially or completely, then thousands of more people will get infected and die.”

Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of Northwestern University’s Institute of Global Health, agrees that it’s vital to ramp up testing to understand the true reach of the virus, isolate those who are infected, enable public health workers to trace the contacts of those who have been infected and ultimately get Americans back to work.

“Anybody should be able to be tested,” said Murphy.

However, he acknowledged the state — and nation — are a long way from being able to do that.

Goal set weeks ago

On March 29, Pritzker told reporters that he hoped the state would scale its testing capacity from roughly 4,000 tests a day at the time to the elusive 10,000 mark in just 10 days, or by April 9.

But since that deadline — a period in which Pritzker updated the state’s criteria for testing to include anyone with symptoms and additional sites started testing — an average of only 6,149 daily tests were reported. Nearly 8,600 tests were done on April 12, the most on any single day, but the number has dropped again, including on Tuesday when 6,639 tests had been processed in the previous 24 hours.

“There isn’t enough testing and there won’t be for some time to really open everything up,” Pritzker said during his daily press briefing. “And the fact that we’re going to need a whole lot more means we have to leave things still in a place that seems not normal to everybody and won’t be for some time.”

Illinois isn’t the only state struggling to run more tests, though. The lack of widespread testing has remained a critical issue since COVID-19 was first detected in the U.S. in January, and failures on the federal level appear to have set the country back as the deadly virus took hold.

Considerable steps have since been taken to bolster the country’s testing capacity: New diagnostic tests have been rolled out, more testing sites have cropped up and major commercial labs are now processing results.

Supply shortage

But whether having more capacity is enough to boost the actual number of tests taken and processed is another question.

President Donald Trump continues to spar with several governors as his administration insists that states aren’t utilizing their entire testing capacity based on the number of testing machines at hospitals and labs. Illinois, for example, has enough machines to run 16,000 to 30,000 tests a day, the federal government said in documents released Monday.

Pritzker pushed back, noting that states require more swabs to take samples from people, and more materials to transport those samples to labs and process them. He has not made a new estimate on when the state could reach the 10,000-test threshold.

Murphy said making sure the states have enough supplies to increase testing is “obviously a federal thing. ... The supply chain involves multiple states and even multiple countries, so who can coordinate that?”

10,000 not enough?

Even once the state gets to 10,000 tests a day, that isn’t enough to truly return things to normal, some experts said.

The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank based in Washington, D.C., is calling for 371,000 daily tests, while former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottleib holds that 430,000 coronavirus tests should be processed each day, according to a report released Friday by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. Meanwhile, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Romer believes half the country should get tested each week, amounting to 23 million tests a day.

Adjusting those models for Illinois’ population of 12.67 million, or roughly 3.9% of the national populace, the state would have to process between 14,469 and 897,000 tests each day.

“There is not yet consensus over what approach to testing is required for social distancing measures to be loosened, or exactly how much capacity is needed,” the Kaiser report stated. “But, by any measure, it is clear that we are far from being able to do enough tests to enable us to move to the next phase of responding to the pandemic in states across the country.”",1
1370,1377,1900,Biased mainstream media again misuses science to paint sensible Sweden as reckless gamblers - here is why they are wrong,"By Peter Andrews , Irish science journalist and writer based in London. He has a background in the life sciences, and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in genetics

Sweden has found that just 7.3 percent of Stockholmers have antibodies for coronavirus, despite the country’s laissez-faire handling of the outbreak. The mainstream media think this proves them right. It doesn’t.

Just last week, I criticized a piece of reportage in the Guardian, that grand old publication, for its remedial understanding of coronavirus. They are at it again, this time holding up an antibody study as evidence that Sweden, a land of dangerous wrong-think, is killing people with its coronavirus policy.

First, let us deal with the study itself. It reported that, based on antibody tests – which are supposed to detect people who have had and cleared the coronavirus – far fewer Stockholmers had had the virus than thought, which would mean that Sweden has a long way to go to reach herd immunity. But the thing about antibody tests is that they are utterly unreliable.

Also on rt.com Shameful treatment of the elderly is further proof Sweden got its Covid-19 strategy all wrong

There is no way to know what proportion of infected people generate antibodies. And even if they all do, we don’t know how accurate the tests are in detecting them. Therefore, as Professor Sunetra Gupta of the University Oxford confirmed on Thursday, the figure that comes out of an antibody test is a lower bound of the proportion of people who have been infected. A more honest reporting of the data would have read “At least 7.3 percent of Stockholm had Covid-19 antibodies by the end of April.”

Sweden turns heel

In order to turn on their usual social democratic idols Sweden, the Guardian has had to spin harder than a hamster on a wheel. They have decided to find a metric on which Sweden can be made to look bad, and they have chosen to compare its deaths per million to the other Nordic countries. Deaths per million is a laughably crude metric that takes no confounding factors into account – least of all the wildly different reporting countries use for Covid deaths. At the bottom of the Guardian’s graph is a disclaimer reading: “Note: counting methods vary by country.”

Sweden does score higher than Denmark, Norway and Finland on that particular metric, due in large part to their failure to keep the virus out of nursing homes. But in order to ascribe this difference to Sweden’s decision not to shut down their economy, the Guardian must establish that France, the UK, and above all Belgium – well above Sweden in deaths per million – have been even more laissez-faire than Sweden regarding the virus. But of course this is impossible.

Also on rt.com ‘Swedish model’ of no-lockdown response to Covid-19 ‘WORKED REGARDLESS OF EXCESSIVE DEATHS,’ its architect says

They appear to have found a Swedish Guardian reader, one Bjorn Olsen of Uppsala University. Olsen, taking the 7.3 percent antibody result at face value, and being a man of some education, has calculated that this is rather far away from the 50 or 60 percent required for herd immunity. “I think herd immunity is a long way off,” tooted the professor of infectious medicine.

But Sweden is not aiming for herd immunity, as their state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell keeps telling people. They are simply ensuring that hospitals do not become overwhelmed, rather than being scared of the second wave. You know, as was the point all along. When, by the way, did that go out the window? Wasn’t all of this done on the pretext of not inundating hospitals with too many patients at once?

Less rationalism, please

I’ll give them this: the Guardian has a knack of unearthing quirky opinions. Another of their popular Sweden articles, which almost has to be read to be believed, is by Tae Hoon Kim, a South Korean based in Stockholm. Kim moans that he is “worried” and “not reassured” by the Swedish government’s virus-wrangling.

Kim also thinks that Sweden’s “tendency to regard coronavirus just as a serious public health problem… something that requires the careful observance of rules set out by health experts” has got them into trouble. Instead, he prefers to think of the loop of RNA as “an ‘invisible enemy’… an existential problem that calls for the state to suspend civil liberties.”

Also on rt.com Why is the MSM working overtime to try to show that Covid-19 is dangerous to CHILDREN - when so few of them have died?

Perhaps Kim would feel more comfortable in, er, I don’t know, South Korea? There, the government would know his exact whereabouts at all times via a compulsory app on his phone, and he would have to tell them the nature of his business everywhere he went. But what do I know? Maybe Kim is right, and we do need more woo-woo philosophizing and op-ed psychobabble. Perhaps a few more celebrity renditions of Kumbaya? As long as we’re spitballing…

Swedes 1, Turnips 0

It is remarkable that even in a year with no Eurovision, Sweden has managed to make such a splash in the Western media. It is fascinating to watch them tie themselves in knots as they try to reconcile their image of Sweden as a progressive paradise with their new notion of a Scandinavian banana republic running a callous Darwinian experiment in which the old are sacrificed for the empty pleasures of the young.

Oh, how the MSM would have loved it if the one country to deviate from conventional wisdom had been Hungary, or the Philippines, or best of all, Russia. How much easier the smear job would have been had it been some poor, backward Latin American or Asian country, or anywhere run by a “literally Hitler” strongman-type politician. But they had no such luck; sensible, freethinking Sweden had to go and deviate from the party line.

No matter how much the MSM bury their heads in the sand, Sweden is running the safest, most responsible reaction to the outbreak in a world gone mad. The real experimenters are the lockdown evangelists. They are the ones playing with people’s lives, and it is high time they accepted that responsibility.

936,936,1111,Europe’s dirty (money) secret,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1
1199,1199,1533,"Thrash Metal Drummer Awakens from Coronavirus Coma, Doesn't Think Satan Is That Cool Anymore","As the coronavirus pandemic continues, researchers are discovering new symptoms and side effects of the disease. Some people who have recovered from COVID-19 are still reporting lingering chest pain and shortness of breath, and in some cases people are reporting a rash disgustingly referred to as ""COVID toes."" And in at least one case, the novel coronavirus has caused visions of a Dante-like trip to Hell.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle's Datebook, the thrash metal band Death Angel was in Europe for a tour in early March when the outbreak went global. They cancelled the tour and headed back to the U.S., but on the flight back drummer Will Carroll started showing symptoms. After testing positive, he spent 12 days in a medically induced coma. When he finally woke up on March 30, the staff at California Pacific Medical Center applauded. ""(The medical staff) couldn’t believe it,"" he told the Chronicle. ""They were ecstatic because it was a success story.""

Carroll had more reason to celebrate, not just because he was returning to good health, but because those 12 days were full of some pretty upsetting visions. Per the Chronicle:

While in the coma, Carroll said he had dreams of visiting the afterlife. He saw himself leave his body and plummet down to hell, where Satan—a woman in his case—punished him for the deadly sin of sloth, morphing him into a Jabba the Hutt-like-monster who vomited blood until he had a heart attack. ""I woke up on the hospital bed with tubes coming in and out of me, and there was a nurse right there and my first words were, 'Am I still in hell?'"" Carroll said. ""She ignored me.""

It takes a very professional nurse to take a patient rambling about hell in stride. In Carroll's case though, the experience has him reevaluating some things. ""I’m still going to listen to satanic metal, and I still love Deicide and bands like that,"" he told the Chronicle. ""As far as for my personal life and my experience of what I went through, I don’t think Satan’s quite as cool as I used to.""

Slate is making its essential coronavirus coverage free for all readers. Subscribe to support our journalism. Start your free trial.

Mr. X had been on a ventilator for more than three weeks when he died for the first time, the second time, the third time, and the fourth and final time. Each time he died, his heart stopped beating. Each time we performed chest compressions, gave him eleventh-hour medications, and resuscitated him, until the final time. None of it would have happened if Mr. X had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

While Mr. X was my patient for only a few days, the truth is that there have been tens of thousands like him across the United States over the past three months, men and women who have died of the coronavirus—more than 85,000 as of this writing. Despite our communal response to COVID-19, I fear there may still be tens of thousands yet to come if not more. For that reason, it is important the story of Mr. X and his death be told. He was a unique person with a singular life, but in terms of dying from the coronavirus, he could have been you, me, or anyone.

He was not a young man, but he was not especially old either. He was in his 70s, the same age as my parents. He had an irregular heart beat for which he took blood thinners and an immune condition for which he took a low dose of daily steroid. Like 1 in 10 of the U.S. population, he had diabetes. Long ago he suffered a mild stroke.

Upon his death, he had already been treated in the ICU with antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia three times. A few days earlier, he had a heart attack on account of the stresses critical illness was placing on his body. This was despite already being on high-dose steroids to boost his insufficient adrenal glands in coping with that stress.

When he came into the emergency department three weeks earlier, he had only been sick for less than a day with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a cough. Six hours later he was gasping for air, intubated with a tube down his throat, and put on a breathing machine like nearly 11 percent of people with COVID-19 in hospitals. Tragically roughly half those intubated people end up dying of acute respiratory distress syndrome, lungs that are so critically damaged by COVID-19 that they cease being able to deliver oxygen into the blood. This was the fate of Mr. X.

For days after his admission into the hospital, Mr. X was also in septic shock. His blood pressure was dangerously low and supported with medication delivered through an intravenous tube placed into the jugular vein in the right side of his neck. Its tip ended in the big vein that fed the right side of his heart, allowing for medication to instantaneously mix into the blood.

Despite all this, there were moments of hope. At some point, Mr. X no longer required medication to maintain his blood pressure. The level of oxygen needed through his breathing tube decreased. His support was weaned. But in this lull, multiple tests of whether Mr. X had the strength to come off his ventilator ended in failure, with hope always lying in trying again the next day.

But after steadily improving over weeks, he quickly began to worsen over a single day. The first time his heart stopped was at noon that day. His blood pressure plummeted, and his heart rate dropped. Everyone in the ICU was at the ready when his pulse disappeared and CPR was started. Six minutes and two doses of epinephrine later, his pulse returned. He was alive again.

Forty minute later, Mr. X died a second time. A “CODE BLUE” was announced over the hospital speakers. Three minutes later, there was a pulse. An emergency ultrasound showed strain in his right heart indirectly pointing toward a massive blood clot in the lungs despite his blood thinner; he received an urgent clot-busting infusion twice.

Then, 20 minutes later, his pulse disappeared a third time as Mr. X’s heart went into ventricular fibrillation, a twitchy, shockable rhythm. In five minutes, he received two shocks at 200 joules each and his pulse returned. But the situation was dire with blood tests showing such profound abnormalities that we all knew we were no longer extending Mr. X’s life insomuch as prolonging his death.

We spoke to his family throughout Mr. X’s ordeal. We all agreed not to start compressions if his heart stopped a fourth time. In three weeks, they were never able to visit him in the hospital. But as his medical team, we called them every day with updates.

Mr. X died an hour after we decided not to start compressions again, at 3:38 p.m. A nurse held his left hand while a doctor held his right hand as his heartbeat gradually slowed before it disappeared forever. His family received their last phone call from the doctor with the sadly expected news.

Mr. X died after being infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The story of his death is his, but I worry there will be many more to come, with stories that start to feel familiar.

898,898,1072,Abortion funds see an increase in calls during the coronavirus pandemic,"Abortion funds see an increase in calls during the coronavirus pandemic The increase in need comes as unemployment reaches new highs.

As the novel coronavirus continues to impact most aspects of American life, including health care, abortion funds across the country are reporting that calls for assistance have increased.

Abortion funds provide money and other forms of assistance to patients seeking abortions, including to help cover the cost of the procedure itself as well as associated costs like transportation, child care and hotel stays as getting an abortion for many U.S. patients involves traveling long distances to clinics and multi-day processes due to state laws.

The Tampa Bay Abortion Fund reported a 30% increase in callers in April from March, and the Chicago Abortion Fund reported a 35% increase in callers in March and April from February, marking a total year-over-year increase of more than 140%. The Chicago fund notes the yearly increase started before the pandemic, in part due to an increase in restrictive laws around Illinois, but recently it has been seeing an increase in callers who needed the full price of the procedure funded, rather than just a percentage.

Fund Texas Choice and Women Have Options in Ohio report they have had to increase their spending and funding since the pandemic hit in March. Other funds, like the New Orleans Abortion Fund, have become more proactive, increasing outreach and ads so patients can access care.

These increases in need come as the country is facing historic unemployment levels, meaning that people are less able to pay for unexpected costs like those associated with accessing an abortion. And while anti-abortion legislators have been working to shut down access for years, the pandemic has sparked new fights as some state lawmakers seek to label abortion a nonessential procedure.

""All of this, plus the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression, means people who might not have had the need to call an abortion fund a month ago are now facing economic instability and uncertainty, new difficulties affecting their parenting options and a landscape more hostile to their reproductive choices. As a result, the need for abortion funds only grows,"" Yamani Hernandez, executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds, which serves as the umbrella organization for the local funds, told ABC News.

Hernandez noted that the pandemic hit in the midst of the national network's annual fundraising push, which was expected to raise $2 million, so funds are facing even more of a crunch. Even so, she said, ""Abortion funds know what it means to fill the gaps of a public health crisis, and that’s what we’ll continue to do now.""

In Kentucky, one of several states with only one abortion clinic, the state attorney general called for abortion providers to stop providing care in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic in March. Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, vetoed a bill pushed by Republican lawmakers in late April that would have given Attorney General Daniel Cameron the authority to ban abortion procedures during the outbreak.

""Kentucky's anti-abortion laws created the foundation for even more restricted access during the pandemic,"" Meg Sasse Stern, support fund director for Kentucky Health Justice Network, told ABC News.

Kentucky Health Justice Network also reported an increase in calls since March, adding that many callers said they are delaying accessing abortion care because of worries about, and practical barriers created by, coronavirus.

""Transportation and child care remain the largest hurdles that Kentucky patients face, and having to overcome those hurdles has caused patients to delay care,"" Stern said.

Typically, Kentucky Health Justice Network can help patients by driving them to appointments, but Stern said because of coronavirus ""drivers can no longer drive to rural areas to pick up patients for appointments, creating more challenges for the caller.""

Stern also expects the increase in calls for need to continue into the summer with the shelter-in-place orders, ""just as we see after a winter storm event.""

""Even during a pandemic, people will still need abortions, and regardless of when or why folks need support accessing abortions, we are here to accompany them,"" Stern said.",1
1081,1081,1290,We Have No Idea How Many People in Prison Actually Have COVID-19,"A May 12 demonstration in front of the Phillip Burton Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in San Francisco to honor victims of COVID-19 who have died while incarcerated Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

In Arizona, only 0.33 percent of the prison population has tested positive for COVID-19. This may seem encouraging—until you realize that tests have only been administered to 533 people of a total daily population of 41,248. Meanwhile, in Marion Correctional Institution, a prison in Ohio that has conducted mass testing, 2,143 incarcerated individuals (nearly 90 percent of the facility’s population) have tested positive, and 14 have died.

These contrasting examples demonstrate a disturbing reality: We don’t have a good picture of how COVID-19 is ravaging the criminal justice system now, and it’s even more unclear what the system will look like in the future. The only certainty is that effects on incarcerated people, corrections staff, and their families and communities are and will continue to be devastating. While many facilities have taken some steps in the right direction, few have taken enough.

Now, it has fallen on researchers, journalists, and advocates to gather, centralize, and share data about the toll of COVID-19 behind bars, with the hope that more information will lead to better responses—and saved lives.

The U.S. criminal justice system, by design, has long been a black box. In the 1970s, the beginning of the era of mass incarceration, the Supreme Court affirmed corrections officials’ rights to limit public and media access in their institutions, creating what Sharon Dolovich, a professor of law at the UCLA School of Law, calls a “culture of secrecy.”

Over the next several decades, the reality that took hold in prisons and jails around the U.S. involved “increasing crowding, increasing inadequacy of health care, [and] increasing inhumanity of conditions,” said Dolovich. And now, those same facilities are facing a pandemic.

The perils COVID-19 poses for incarcerated people are numerous. The incarcerated population is aging, and many individuals have prior conditions. Social distancing is often impossible, and even simple measures like frequent hand-washing and cleaning high-touch items can be severely limited. Very few facilities are testing sufficiently, and the few facilities that are mass testing (like Marion) are finding “mass infections.”

A lack of public information about what’s going on in prisons and jails—in normal and pandemic times—leaves room for neglect, missteps, and backward-oriented thinking, which ultimately threaten not just incarcerated populations but also the communities inextricably connected to them. Thus, it is crucial to track the steps facilities are and are not taking, and their consequences. The U.S. criminal justice system is highly decentralized and opaque, but jails and prisons often rely on lessons from other jurisdictions in considering what policy changes are possible in their own facilities, said Maddy deLone, the former executive director of the Innocence Project.

In March, deLone began watching facilities in New York take action to reduce their incarcerated populations through releases. She wondered if other facilities around the U.S. were doing the same—and whether any of it was being systematically tracked. When she found it wasn’t, she joined forces with Dolovich, who had started a collaborative spreadsheet to document criminal justice responses to COVID-19. The spreadsheet, which Dolovich first conceived in early March as a tool for personal research, quickly became the UCLA School of Law COVID-19 Behind Bars Data Project.

The project, directed by Dolovich, is tracking confirmed cases and deaths in corrections facilities; prison, jail, and immigration detention releases, as well as requests for such releases; policies affecting carceral conditions and visitation policies; and the situations in youth correctional and immigration detention facilities, among other indicators. Along with initiatives like Covid Prison Data, the project serves as a small window into the U.S. criminal justice system during a moment when most doors are bolted shut.

The project, which is largely volunteer-run, involves scraping dashboards published by corrections facilities where possible, but some categories involve a more qualitative process, gathering information submitted by individuals or digging through media reports and press releases.

The project’s audience is generally a mix of journalists, litigators, and policy analysts, Dolovich said. One user is Recidiviz, a nonprofit that employs data to help corrections departments reduce incarceration. Clementine Jacoby, Recidiviz’s executive director, told me that when the pandemic hit, “Suddenly the need for timely, granular data … became a really acute need.” To meet that need, a team of software engineers from the group sat down over a weekend in late March. Seventy-two hours later, they launched their first COVID-19 impact model in the form of an Excel spreadsheet. Within 48 hours, the model had been downloaded in all 50 states.

Since then, Recidiviz has released a web application available for free to anyone with a .gov email address. It’s also updated its Excel model, which anyone can download online. The model combines epidemiological data with criminal justice data—including the data collected by the UCLA Law project—to allow corrections officials to predict things like when cases will peak in their facilities, how many hospitalizations and fatalities will result from that peak, and how policy changes such as reducing population or adjusting living conditions can flatten the curve.

Looking to the future, Dolovich said she hasn’t seen any recognition of the “need to overcome the culture of secrecy” that permeates the corrections space. Still, she can find reasons to be hopeful.

To start, officials across the country are strategizing to reduce the incarcerated population through releases and reduced admissions. “And that is a sea change from the mindset that we have had for the last four and a half decades,” Dolovich said.

There are also signs of a “collective cultural shift,” said Dolovich. Increased awareness of the dangers of COVID-19 in prisons and jails has humanized the people held by system built upon dehumanization, pushing forward the recognition that it is profoundly unjust, in deLone’s words, “to subject them to death when that wasn’t the sentence.”

That’s a shift that’s hard to quantify or track, said Dolovich. But there’s no doubt it’s a significant one.

757,757,926,"Grants arrive for nearly 1,000 Chicago microbusinesses","City officials said Thursday they have awarded $5,000 grants to 959 microbusinesses in dire straits because of the shutdown caused by attempts to control the coronavirus.

It’s unknown how many of the businesses will survive, but officials said they hope the grants will help the smallest of small businesses in low- to moderate-income communities.

“These are businesses that don’t have a lot of options for help,” said Rosa Escareno, commissioner of the city’s Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection. “They are sole proprietors or they hire one or two people from down the block.”

One of the grant recipients, William Ball, owner of Abundance Bakery, 105 E. 47th St., said he’s struggling with how to reopen his 650-square-foot store. “We need to catch up on bills. My credit rating is going down the tubes. Thirty years, 650 square feet — it’s my life,” he said.

Ball said he’s waiting on word from other grants and loans he has applied for, but believes larger operators are in line ahead of him. “The government has to make some corrections in our community,” he said. “They have driven all the blue-collar jobs overseas. That’s why we have a high rate of crime. There’s just no opportunity.”

The grantees were selected by lottery from more than 4,500 applications, Escareno said. With help from five community organizations, the city vetted and picked recipients a week after the application period closed for the Microbusiness Recovery Grant Program. Escareno said all recipients will have the money in hand by Friday.

Money for the program came from the Chicago Community Trust, which continues to raise money for COVID-19 relief. Escareno said demand was so high, the grant program may be reopened to consider more applicants.

“From family-owned coffee shops to mom-and-pop retail stores, our microbusinesses are the beating heart of our communities and local economy,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. “With the Microbusiness Recovery Grant Program, we are putting much-needed relief into the hands of nearly 1,000 of Chicago’s most-impacted local entrepreneurs so that we can reinvigorate communities on our road to recovery.”

Officials said that more than two-thirds of grantees reported in a survey that they have not received other emergency funding. To be eligible, businesses must have had four or fewer employees, annual revenue of less than $250,000 and be located within a low- or moderate-income community area.

More than 90% of the recipients were businesses headed by women, African Americans or Latinos, city officials said. On average, businesses getting the grants have been open for more than 10 years, they said.

Ald. Emma Mitts (37th) called the grants a “critical lifeline” to local businesses. “In less than two weeks, the city established a first-of-its-kind emergency grant program and is now putting those relief funds directly into the hands of our community entrepreneurs,” Mitts said.

The program is in addition to loans available under the city’s $100 million Small Business Resiliency Fund. Officials said the resiliency fund has approved 316 loans for nearly $12 million, with another 268 loans totaling $9.5 million in the final stages of underwriting.",1
292,292,373,Broadway star Nick Cordero undergoes leg amputation due to coronavirus complications,"NEW YORK — Tony Award-nominated actor Nick Cordero has had his his right leg amputated after suffering complications from the coronavirus, his wife says.

Amanda Kloots on Instagram wrote late Saturday that Cordero “made it out of surgery alive and is headed to his room to rest and recover.”

Cordero had been treated with blood thinners to help with clotting in his leg, but his doctors had to stop the treatment because it was causing internal bleeding.

“We took him off blood thinners but that again was going to cause some clotting in the right leg, so the right leg will be amputated today,” she said earlier Saturday.

Cordero entered the intensive care unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on March 31 and has been on a ventilator and unconscious after contracting COVID-19.

His wife has been sending him daily videos of her and their 10-month-old son, Elvis, so he could see them when he woke up, and urging friends and fans to join a daily sing-a-long. A GoFundMe fundraiser has raised over $200,000.

Cordero played a mob soldier with a flair for the dramatic in 2014 in Broadway’s Woody Allen 1994 film adaptation of “Bullets Over Broadway,” for which he received a Tony nomination for best featured actor in a musical. He moved to Los Angeles to star in “Rock of Ages.”

The lanky Cordero originated the menacing role of husband Earl opposite his estranged wife, played by Jessie Mueller, in “Waitress” on Broadway, as well as the role of Sonny in Chazz Palminteri’s “A Bronx Tale.”

On the small screen, Cordero appeared in several episodes of “Blue Bloods” and “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” as well as “Lilyhammer” and he had a role in the film “Going in Style.”

The virus has sickened other Broadway veterans, including the actors Danny Burstein, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Gavin Creel, Aaron Tveit and Laura Bell Bundy as well as composer David Bryan. It has also claimed the life of Tony-winning playwright Terrence McNally.",1
571,571,701,Here's an idea why Secretary of State Pompeo keeps spreading the conspiracy theory that coronavirus escaped from a Chinese lab,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other China hawks in GOP are ignoring US intelligence agencies, and continuing to spread the conspiracy theory that the coronavirus came from a Chinese government lab.

They're doing it for an audience of one — Donald Trump.

China hawks have always fought to get Trump to take an even harder line on China, but he's often put his hopes of signing a trade deal with China first.

By turning this anti-China conspiracy theory into a talking point on Trump's favorite TV shows and in his political circles, though, hawks could win Trump to their side. It's worked before.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In recent weeks Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been making the rounds on the conservative media circuit, spreading the conspiracy theory that the coronavirus may have escaped from a Chinese government laboratory in Wuhan. He's started getting in fights with mainstream media about it too.

The scientific consensus is that the virus was not man made, and US intelligence agencies have said that there's no evidence that the virus escaped from a lab instead of occurring naturally and spreading to an open market in Wuhan.

Still, Pompeo insists he has evidence to support his theory, though he hasn't provided any. High ranking members of the GOP, like Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, have spread the idea on conservative media outlets as well.

Maybe they believe this stuff. And maybe they have evidence they plan on showing the American people eventually. But given how blatantly Pompeo dodges the evidence question when it's raised in mainstream media, it's more likely they're just performing for an audience of one — President Donald Trump.

By turning this theory about the virus' creation into a Fox News talking point, Republicans who want the president to be more aggressive towards China can feed it to Trump through his favorite filter. That, in turn, could harden his stance on China.

Trump has a history of going softer on China than the hawkish in his administration and in his party would like, and on issues that really matter. Instead of listening to the hawks, he takes a softer stance often recommended by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and other more business-focused officials working on the US trade deal with China, Trump's obsession.

For example, Congress unanimously passed bills in December condemning China for its treatment of Uighur Muslims and for its anti-democratic encroachment on civil liberties in Hong Kong. For any normal White House this would be an obvious moment to stand up for human rights, but Trump didn't voice support for either cause.

And in between complaining about the unfairness that prompted him to start a trade war with China, Trump has always professed to like and respect Chinese President Xi Jinping. He's maintained that in press conferences throughout this pandemic.

For a time Trump insisted on calling the coronavirus the ""Wuhan virus,"" in an attempt to retaliate when a Chinese diplomat started spreading the conspiracy theory that it came from the US. But after a meeting of G20 world leaders at the end of March he pulled back from that.

Trump came out of that G20 meeting talking about how many ventilators the US would soon sell to other countries — as if COVID-19 were a businesses opportunity, a deal. It's clear that he would like to get back to that as soon as possible. That's why he's trying to declare victory over the virus and open up the economy again. He wants to get back to what his presidency used to be, and that includes spending his time haggling over soybeans with China.

That return to normalcy is just not ideal for Washington's China hawks — not with anger at China increasing around the world. Countries like the UK and Australia are calling for an inquiry into the origins of the virus. And if Trump is more focused on getting a trade deal from China, he may not be as supportive.

The idea that China unleashed the virus on the world and refuses to take responsibility for it, though, may be enough to sustain Trump's anger so that he continues to listen to hawks like Pompeo, sidelining pragmatists like Mnuchin.

Trump's habit of regurgitating ideas he's heard in conservative media circles is well documented. Most recently, Axios reports that Trump has taken to questioning the official COVID-19 death toll. It's a theory that got conservative talking heads Diamond and Silk kicked off of Fox News, but it's been floating around the right wing since death tolls started rising in the US at the end of March.

So filtering an idea that could harden Trump's stance on China through his favorite TV shows could work. In fact, it could be working right now.",1
108,108,156,Make the post-coronavirus world better,"As the COVID-19 virus spreads, we are worried and anxious. Many of us are angry at leaders stumbling to protect us during the crisis. It’s healthy and important to convert emotion into action right now.

Opinion

Gov. J.B. Pritzker, his staff, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and legislative leaders have done a phenomenal job of leading us through this crisis in the vacuum of leadership at the federal executive branch. They’ve been right to prioritize our health and safety. As an individual, you can make a difference by staying home, washing your hands and not flushing wet wipes, which clog pipes — the last thing we need right now is clogged sewer systems. Call your friends, family and neighbors to make sure they are doing OK.

It is right to focus on these immediate steps. We must also be vigilant as decision-makers look to dedicate trillions of public dollars to relief packages. Environmental advocates must shift our priorities to make sure these plans are focused on helping the most vulnerable. We can do that by emailing our lawmakers — avoid calling to keep office lines free for emergencies — and expressing the following:

Communities and people should be the center of relief efforts. Union contracts, rights and benefits for low-wage workers, paid sick leave and improved working conditions have always been environmental issues. COVID-19 is not just a public health crisis; it is an environmental and economic justice crisis disproportionately impacting workers and disadvantaged communities already burdened by racism, pollution and compromised immune systems. Tell your lawmakers to support policies that improve worker conditions such as paid sick leave and support low income people — for example, ending utility shutoffs or offering rent support.

Our safety net is under attack and must be rebuilt. The Trump administration has systematically weakened our institutions of government, jeopardizing the safety net for all of us and making us more vulnerable to crises of all kinds. Let’s make sure elected officials know that we must rebuild the agencies that have been decimated by defunding and neglect.

Climate change is exacerbating this crisis. High levels of pollution have put vulnerable communities at greater risk of serious health impacts from COVID-19. Air pollution damages lungs and can cause chronic diseases like asthma, COPD and lung cancer. Scientists expect catastrophic events and pandemics to increase as the climate changes, and this tragedy is showcasing how unprepared we are for that future. Stimulus packages must not subsidize businesses that are contributing to climate change and harming public health. Long-term policy must continue to fight climate change emissions.

Environmental advocacy in this time of crisis needs to address the glaring structural weaknesses in our economic and political system laid bare by the pandemic. We should only consider our economy to be thriving if workers, the environment and communities are protected and healthy.

Once securing your own health and safety, I urge you to contact your elected officials to make sure the world we create after this crisis is more resilient and compassionate than ever before.

800,800,969,"Experts share the top 3 ways to speed up testing a coronavirus vaccine, including intentionally exposing people to the virus","Most vaccines take years to develop, from start to finish.

A big chunk of that time is spent testing the vaccine to make sure it's safe for people to take and that it works to prevent the disease.

Researchers are looking at every possible way to shorten this process for a coronavirus vaccine.

Three strategies have emerged to test a vaccine more quickly amid a crisis, vaccine experts say. They are human challenge trials, stepped wedge designs, and ring vaccination.

Each approach comes with its own benefits and risks, according to vaccine experts we interviewed.

Read live updates about the coronavirus here.

Developing a vaccine is a critical element in squashing the coronavirus pandemic.

But there's no consensus on the best way to actually test a vaccine for safety and efficacy during a crisis. What there are, however, are three leading ideas on how to test vaccines. Each approach comes with unique pros and cons.

There are now more than 100 potential coronavirus vaccines in the works, at least 20 of which are expected to enter human testing within this year. But turning early research into a real vaccine requires time and resources.

Read more: Scientists are racing to create a coronavirus vaccine that can halt the pandemic in its tracks. Here are the top 3 candidates aiming to be ready this fall.

The potential ways to vet a possible coronavirus vaccine more quickly are human challenge trials, stepped wedge designs, and ring vaccination, according to top vaccine experts interviewed by Business Insider. All the approaches can speed up testing a vaccine, a process that normally takes multiple years with several distinct clinical trials.

But any of the strategies will test ordinary research protocols that call for substantial testing before a vaccine is used broadly. The safety bar is particularly high for vaccines since they are given to massive populations of healthy people. A pharmacist gives Jennifer Haller, left, the first shot in the first-stage safety study clinical trial of a potential vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Ted S. Warren/Associated Press

Additionally, some of the approaches carry ethical concerns. Challenge trials, for instance, promise a speedy answer as to whether a vaccine works, because people who get the immunization are then exposed to the virus. Those volunteers could be risking their lives if the vaccine fails and they become ill.

Others, like the ring vaccination strategy, wouldn't raise the same ethical worries but require more time. Ring vaccination has helped control outbreaks of smallpox and Ebola in the past. Dr. Francis Collins

Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said that running a gold-standard clinical trial, in which some people get the vaccine and others gets the placebo, in an area with a coronavirus outbreak, is likely to be the best approach.

""Why don't we just do this the way that would be most straightforward"" Collins said, ""which is to enroll tens of thousands of participants in areas where the virus is still circulating with an appropriate placebo control and see whether it works or not.""

No matter which approach is taken, there is also skepticism that any vaccine could be widely available within 18 months. That timeline has been echoed by prominent health officials, nonprofit leaders, and policymakers.

Read more: As more experimental coronavirus vaccines start human testing, industry leaders and experts doubt they'll be ready before 2022

That isn't stopping companies from racing to develop a vaccine in record time, with three leading vaccine programs aiming to be ready this fall for emergency use.

Here are the three main approaches that researchers are considering to test a coronavirus vaccine.

Human challenge trials offer speed but raise ethical concerns about exposing people to the virus

In challenge trials, participants would be vaccinated and then intentionally exposed to the virus. The design offers an attractive option for those wanting a quick answer.

""There are some people calling for that,"" Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group, said. ""You could decide in weeks whether this vaccine candidate works or doesn't."" Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group Mayo Clinic

One of the leading advocates for challenge studies is Dr. Stanley Plotkin. Plotkin has been in vaccine research for more than half a century, helping discover the rubella virus vaccine in the 1960s.

""We don't know whether there is such a thing as immunity to the virus,"" Plotkin told Business Insider. ""Until we know that, vaccines are going to be hypothetical. That's really the crucial question at the moment, and the sooner we know the answer to that, the better off we're going to be.""

Challenge studies could help answer that question quickly. Along with New York University bioethicist Arthur Caplan, Plotkin argued that challenge studies are the way to go. While unusual, the design has been used before in humans for vaccines for influenza and malaria.

Arthur L Caplan NYU School of Medicine ""Deliberately causing disease in humans is normally abhorrent, but asking volunteers to take risks without pressure or coercion is not exploitation but benefiting from altruism,"" Plotkin and Caplan wrote. ""We are aware of multiple offers from people willing to volunteer for the challenge studies. As Shakespeare put it, 'Desperate diseases by desperate measures are relieved.'""

Mayo's Poland cautioned that a challenge trial can be done but may lead to unforeseen problems.

""I think there's a way to do it,"" he said. ""You have to be very, very careful about full informed consent because bad things can happen that you may not be able to predict or are not even thinking about. That's part of the history of vaccinology. It's that things happen that we don't expect.""

Maria Elena Bottazzi, a vaccine researcher at Baylor College, said it took years to devise a challenge model for malaria, and a key consideration was having a treatment available in case the vaccine didn't work.

""You have to have a way of getting rid of the virus or reducing the disease that the virus causes,"" she said.

Despite generating a lot of publicity, no vaccine company has announced plans to run such a study in COVID-19.

Collins told Business Insider he's skeptical of this approach and said he doesn't think it will play a role in developing a vaccine for COVID-19.

Starting a human challenge study would require having good manufacturing practice material that's ready to go, Collins said.

""None of these vaccine platforms are there yet,"" Collins said. ""When they get there, they will be ready also to start a standard efficacy trial enrolling thousands of patients, which is a much more compelling way to show whether the vaccine actually works in the real world.""

NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins speaks during a Senate hearing. Reuters

Collins also says that since challenge studies would use healthy young people as volunteers, they wouldn't necessarily provide a clear answer for efficacy for more vulnerable populations, like the elderly or those with chronic illnesses.

""And of course there are profound ethical questions about whether it is justifiable to put a healthy person at risk when we don't have a cure for this disease that they happen to get sick anyway,"" he continued. ""So I think at the present time, the case for it is pretty weak. The case against it is pretty strong.""

Stepped-wedge design has some prominent backers, including a leading vaccine program

A stepped-wedge design straddles the line between clinical testing and widespread use. The design evaluates a vaccine candidate during an outbreak while also providing significant quantities of the vaccine to the public. It's important to have some data showing that the vaccine is safe before using this strategy, though.

""The point is to provide some potential benefit while building a large and rigorous data set to evaluate its safety and effectiveness,"" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the FDA and a board member at Pfizer, wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed. Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb Reuters

Gottlieb laid out the example of using this design in a city suffering an outbreak. Large clusters of people would be vaccinated at staggered times. In Gottlieb's hypothetical, it could be 25,000 people being vaccinated every two weeks.

That could lead to 100,000 vaccinations in six weeks and allow researchers to compare the groups to see if the timing difference changed the likelihood of becoming infected. If the vaccine works, the groups that received it earlier should have significantly lower levels of COVID-19.

Pfizer's Mikael Dolsten Thomson Reuters Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's chief scientific officer, outlined a very similar strategy for its vaccine candidate. He told Business Insider that Pfizer's vaccine could be tested like this under an emergency use program this fall, vaccinating tens of thousands of people while collecting data to see if the vaccine works.

The ring vaccination strategy took down smallpox and Ebola, but requires precise and strenuous tracing

Ring vaccination studies helped tackle smallpox and Ebola. While it could have a role in COVID-19, the studies require significant public health infrastructure to run correctly.

""It doesn't necessarily mean it's going to work for this,"" Bottazzi warned, saying ring vaccination requires rigorous contract tracing to find all the people who've been in contact with an infected person.

In ring vaccination, a team of researchers or public health workers quickly track down all the close contacts of an infected person. These potentially exposed people would then be vaccinated.

With the right resources, it can be a valuable approach to eradicating diseases. That's what happened in the latter half of the 20th century to eradicate smallpox. The disease had lingered for nearly two centuries after a vaccine was first developed in the 1790s. It remains the only disease to be vanquished by a vaccine.

The smallpox eradication program used two levels of contract tracing. It vaccinated everyone who had been in contact with a confirmed smallpox case. And then researchers also vaccinated the close contacts of all those potentially exposed people.

Ebola vaccines were tested in a similar fashion. In one of those trials, contacts were randomized to either immediately receive a vaccine or be immunized three weeks later. The end result was thousands of people were vaccinated, helping stop the spread of the virus while building the data that supported regulatory approval of a vaccine.

The US is unprepared to perform ring vaccination given the lack of testing and contract tracing currently available.

""We don't have the testing capacity now to know where this disease is,"" Dr. Richard Besser, the former acting head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently told CNN. ""We have not scaled up the thousands and thousands of contact tracers that we need, we don't provide safe places for people to isolate or quarantine if they are identified as either having an infection or being in contact.""",1
791,791,960,How New Zealand beat the coronavirus,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1
812,812,981,California governor proposes closing 2 prisons in response to COVID-19,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom is proposing that the state close two prisons, in part due to a decline in tax revenue amid the pandemic.

Over 500 California prisoners currently have COVID-19. At least five have died.

""As we have seen, jails and prisons have become petri dishes for this pandemic,"" state Rep. Sydney Kamlager, a Democrat from Los Angeles, told Business Insider.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Left-leaning activists for social justice do not, typically, have kind words for austerity, which brings to mind shuttered schools and trimmed welfare rolls. But when California Gov. Gavin Newsom outlined plans this week to slash the state's budget, citing a freefall in tax revenue due to the pandemic, there was qualified praise from some over his decision to cut funding for prisons.

California currently has over 117,000 people in its prisons, more than any other state except for Texas. But the number of incarcerated persons has been falling — by 8% just this year — and that, the product of reduced sentences for drug crimes and efforts to address overcrowding, has meant the state is in a position to begin closing some of its prisons.

In January, Newsom, a Democrat, wanted to close one detention center. Now he wants to close two — and to do it fast. That will save money; according to the state's Legislative Analyst's Office, by more than $100 million per year. It could also save lives.

""As we have seen, jails and prisons have become petri dishes for this pandemic,"" state Rep. Sydney Kamlager, a Democrat from Los Angeles, told Business Insider. ""Closed quarters, lack of circulating air, and staff and vendors who are not regularly tested — and walk in and out — are recipes for public health disasters.""

At least five people have died from COVID-19 while incarcerated in a state prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation; another 524 currently have caught the disease while behind bars.

Last month, Kamlager, who chairs the state committee on incarcerated women, told Business Insider that she hoped that efforts to reduce the prison population, in an effort to arrest the spread of the coronavirus, would extend beyond the current crisis.

Amber-Rose Howard, executive director of Californians United for a Responsible Budget, ""is excited to see the commitment from the governor to close prisons."" But her organization, a coalition of 70 activist groups that advocate cutting prison spending, says the governor's proposal is just a start.

""We believe that California can close five prisons in the next five years,"" Howard told Business Insider. In part, that can be achieved by accelerating early release, as California has started to do in response to the coronavirus. ""Over 20% of the prison population is over the age of 55,"" she noted. ""We need to see the state pushing for elder parole modifications that would release a larger population of people, who statistically have the least risk of contact with law enforcement after release.""

Newsom's proposal, which will require approval by California's Democratic-controlled legislature, already gestures at that, proposing to cut the maximum length of parole — and thus the chances one could be incarcerated over a parole violation — from five years to 24 months.

But with 34 prisons, and plans to close only two over the next three years, critics of mass incarceration see much room for improvement, from the governor granting clemency more often, to voters themselves overturning the state's notorious ""three strikes"" sentencing law.

""I believe there is a better way,"" Rep. Kamlager commented. ""The current system is not it.""

1027,1027,1223,"COVID-19’s hidden victims, Alzheimer's patients in nursing homes","COVID-19’s hidden victims, Alzheimer's patients in nursing homes Nearly 50% of all nursing home residents live with Alzheimer's or dementia.

When Ken Gregersen, 88, left his wife's nursing home in Ankeny, Iowa, on March 11, he didn't know that that would be the last time he'd see her for two months.

""I got an email, or I got notified by the care facility that no longer could I visit her. So I haven't actually seen her then since March,"" he told ABC News.

Evie, his wife of 67 years, is in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease and receives hospice care. Just like thousands across the country, her nursing home closed its doors to visitors amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Howard Smith visits his wife, Lois, a 77-year-old Alzheimer's patient, at the New Paltz Center nursing facility for the first time since lockdowns due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Pine Bush, NY., May 5, 2020. Caitlin Ochs/Reuters

The COVID-19 pandemic has rocked long-term care facilities. State data analyzed by ABC News reveals that almost a third of coronavirus deaths come from nursing homes.

With nearly half of all long-term care facility residents living with Alzheimer's or dementia, individuals with the disease have become one of the most disproportionately impacted groups from COVID-19 in the country.

As coronavirus-related deaths continue to climb, some observers have raised alarms that not enough is being done to protect Alzheimer's and dementia patients and those in long-term care facilities.

""Given some of the numbers that have now emerged, it's pretty clear that we did not have and probably still today don't have what would be full transparency on an accurate and timely basis about where the cases are occurring,"" Alzheimer's Association CEO Harry Johns told ABC News.

Alzheimer's, a chronic neurodegenerative disease, itself, does not make someone more vulnerable to coronavirus. However, those with the illness are more susceptible because they are usually older and/or have co-morbidities. Living in nursing homes also heightens the COVID-19 exposure risk for Alzheimer's and dementia patients.

Still, health concerns are not the only extra burden these individuals carry amid the outbreak. The enforced separation of nursing home residents from their families and loved ones may only increase the hardship.

""Depending on the degree of progression of the disease, someone with Alzheimer's may not understand what's going on,"" Johns said.

""[They] may not understand then why they can't leave the house. Why the kids are at home and extended family. Those kinds of confusions can, in and of themselves create challenges for the individual who has dementia, as well as for those carers,"" he added.

Johns says he believes current public health circumstances impact those with Alzheimer's more than other care home residents.

""For any resident that family contact is so important if someone is ill. But for Alzheimer's, people who have dementia, it is especially difficult because the connections to family can -- when someone has progressed -- keep them grounded,"" Johns told ABC News.

Coronavirus has also forced families of individuals living with Alzheimer's and dementia to navigate not seeing their loved ones for extended periods of time.

""It's not enjoyable at all. I don't know the right emotional words to say. I really do miss her. We're a very close couple, we've been married this long. We've had a wonderful marriage,"" Ken Gregersen said.

Ken's wife, Evie, moved to her nursing home in 2016 after her Alzheimer's diagnosis in 2012. Before the coronavirus outbreak, he would visit his wife three times a day.

""I would go over there and give her her breakfast. And then I'd go back and give her her lunch, and then I also (went) back to give her her dinner in the evening. And that's when I usually stayed a few minutes extra and I'd walk her around in her wheelchair and sing a song to her. And so I could then go from being her caregiver to being her husband again,"" he said.

While Evie's nursing home ended visits, Ken still talks to his wife every weekday on FaceTime. He said as Evie's condition deteriorates -- she can no longer open her eyes or speak -- he worries about many unknowns.

""Every day, when I see her FaceTime, and I talk to her and I try to tell her, what's going on in my life, or what are our children or grandchildren are doing, I always wonder does she hear me? Does she understand me? Does she miss me? You know, it makes me very anxious,"" he added.

Although Evie's nursing home has reported no patients or caregivers testing positive for coronavirus, Ken still worries what could happen if his wife contracts the virus.

""I know that I'm going to lose her someday. I mean I'm prepared for that. I think people who are taking care of someone with Alzheimer's, they start through the grieving process long before death occurs,"" he said.

""I know it's going to occur, but I don't want her to suffer. And the COVID virus ... it looks like there's a lot of suffering going on, you know, gasping for air and being so uncomfortable. That worries me,"" he added.

Ken says he's satisfied with the precautions Evie's nursing home has taken. However, as coronavirus cases rise in long-term care facilities, there have been calls for states and the federal government to do more to protect care facilities.

This week, the Alzheimer's Association announced new policy recommendations to fight coronavirus in long-term care facilities.

Johns identifies increased transparency, testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) as critical in fighting the disease at nursing homes, and helping to get to a point where family members can visit their loved ones.

""We believe it takes these multiple approaches. That PPE will make a difference, but if you don't have the testing, then you can't prevent the outbreaks. If you don't have the transparency, you can't deal rapidly enough with the outbreaks. So, it is the dynamic combination of doing these things that we believe is most crucial,"" Johns said.

""It is the dynamic of all of these things happening to improve people's lives, save people's lives and really, relieve the burden that is so present for people who care for those with Alzheimer's and other dementia,"" he added.

On Monday, President Donald Trump's administration also called for increased coronavirus testing with Vice President Mike Pence telling governors he wants to see every state prioritize COVID-19 screening inside the facilities.

However, those guidelines do not go as far as those of the Alzheimer's Association.

But until those guidelines are met, people continue to wait to visit their loved ones living in long-term care facilities. Meanwhile, family members, like Gregersen, settle for seeing their parents, spouses and friends' faces confined to portable screens.

""Thank goodness the hospice caregivers who come in set up a FaceTime event Monday to Friday so that I get a chance to see [Evie's] face. She no longer opens her eyes, but I'd like to think that she hears my voice. And I'd like to think she recognizes it,"" Gregerson said.

909,909,1083,Elon Musk’s battle to reopen Tesla’s Fremont plant may shape his legacy,"Elon Musk intends to make himself immortal by inserting himself into history books as best he can: electric cars will do, but so will a private mission to Mars. At times, it seems that he is the last subscriber to the “Great Man” theory of history.

Well, none of us have control over our own obituaries

The problem is that history tends to be written by the survivors — a heel turn late in life, for instance, will obliterate any contemporary admiration. In Los Angeles, this is most clearly borne out by William Mullholland. Mulholland — an obsessed engineer whose dream was to supply Los Angeles with enough water for generations of growth — performed an examination on the St. Francis Dam hours before it collapsed, killing hundreds in one of the worst disasters in California’s history. Brilliant and witty as Mullholland was, he is now known primarily for that disaster and his abysmal behavior in the Owens Valley water conflict, which inspired the movie Chinatown.

Well, none of us have control over our own obituaries, assuming we are lucky enough to get an obituary at all. But it is certainly curious to see a man with such an obvious interest in his legacy make moves that may destroy it. This brings us to the reopening of the Tesla Fremont plant in apparent violation of an Alameda County health order prohibiting the factory from operating.

Last week, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that some manufacturing in the state would be allowed to resume on May 8; but if the state and the county disagree, the more restrictive order is the one that matters. And although some counties may go slower than the state in reopening business, no one may go faster, according to Sonia Angell, the head of the state’s department of public health.

The immediate action began with tweets: Musk railed against the Alameda County order to continue sheltering in place and threatened to leave California. He also filed suit against Alameda County. Tesla began making cars again at its Fremont, California factory last weekend, The Verge’s Sean O’Kane reported. Workers who had been placed on furlough were called back. On Monday, Musk tweeted confirmation of that reporting and said, “If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.” Shortly after that, Nevada Gigafactory workers received an email calling them back to work as well, O’Kane reported.

California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2020

On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump tweeted his support for Musk: “California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!” Later that evening, Alameda County announced it had received Tesla’s safety plan for Fremont and that “Tesla can begin to augment their minimum business operations this week in preparation for possible reopening as soon as next week.” On Wednesday, an internal email sent from Tesla said that the company is ramping up its production this week to get to full capacity, Bloomberg News reported.

Fremont is located in one of the six counties that make up the San Francisco Bay Area, which was the first in the country to issue shelter-in-place orders and close non-essential businesses — a move that Musk resisted at the time, causing a county health official to remark Musk had created a public health risk. But the Bay Area’s quick action — along with a little bit of luck — ensured that the cities in it were spared the full horror of the outbreak, at least so far. Though the first community-transmission cases were detected here, only about 350 deaths from COVID-19 had been confirmed as of the beginning of May; University of California San Francisco epidemiologist George Rutherford estimated that the Bay Area’s action had saved more than 1,000 lives.

“California has been progressive and forward-thinking in how they’ve handled COVID-19, and that shows in their numbers,” John Brownstein, who leads the Computational Epidemiology Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital, tells The Verge.

Meanwhile, elsewhere in the country, major outbreaks have occurred at meat packing plants. One report from a Chinese restaurant showed that a single person’s breathing infected 10 people from three families, two of which were sitting at separate tables, over the course of an hour and a half. Another report, of an outbreak in a South Korean call center, showed that one infected employee in the call center resulted in 94 cases — though how much of that is attributable to touching shared objects and how much was airflow remains unknown. A choir rehearsal with a single sick person resulted in 45 cases. At one Staten Island Amazon warehouse, there have been at least 35 cases; across 125 Amazon warehouse facilities, workers have recorded at least 606 cases. At least one Amazon warehouse worker has died of COVID-19.

“It’s outrageous.”

There are still things we don’t know about how the virus spreads, but we do have some clues from these reports: closed environments where people spend a lot of time in proximity seem to be risks, says Brownstein, who is also a professor at Harvard Medical School. Brownstein thinks there are ways to mitigate risk from these environments, but those decisions will vary by location and should be made by local and state governments.

“The biggest thing that offended me about what’s being proposed here is the civil disobedience aspect,” says Mark Cullen, director of the Center for Population Health Sciences at Stanford, in an interview. “Any time you take what turns out to be brilliant planning on the part of our six counties — and to snub the value of that very publicly, make this ‘fuck you’ libertarian statement, and say ‘if you don’t do what I want, I’ll move to another state’ — highlights what’s wrong with public health thinking and policy. It’s outrageous.”

There’s another unknown: what happens if businesses that are reopening must shut down again, says Liliana Tenney, a senior instructor at the Colorado School of Public Health. Until there’s legislation to protect these workers, we should respect local, state, and federal restrictions — and err on the side of caution, Tenney says. That protects all citizens, but particularly workers who face the choice of either working at places like Tesla or unemployment.

“Most employers are very nervous about this return to work.”

“What we’ve seen through our experience is that most employers are very nervous about this return to work and the return to operations,” Tenney tells The Verge. “And they are doing everything in their power to enact safety measures but also to pause and take it slowly.”

All of the experts I spoke to agreed there are ways to make workplaces like Tesla safer. One is to group workers into cohorts, so if one person in the group gets sick, the number of people who are exposed is smaller. Screening people for coronavirus on a daily or weekly basis will also make it less likely a disastrous outbreak will occur, particularly if it’s paired with contact tracing. Personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves, may make workers safer, too. Managing the facility — spacing people out, increasing ventilation, and disinfecting surfaces more frequently — will also lower risks to the workforce.

A “return to work” playbook from Tesla incorporates these ideas, which the company says were inspired by measures implemented at the Chinese Gigafactory. Measures include increased cleaning, providing hand sanitizer, enforcing social distancing, temperature checks at the entry of the factory, adjusting work shifts, reducing the number of people allowed on company shuttles, and providing personal protective equipment. One of the assembly lines is, famously, a tent in a parking lot, which may also provide better ventilation than indoor lines.

“It’s hard to stay six feet from people.”

Production lines are moving more slowly than usual, according to internal Tesla correspondence seen by CNBC. Three Fremont employees told the outlet that their temperatures were taken at the factory entrance, dispensers for hand sanitizer had been placed, and they’d been given surgical masks. Scheduled break times were meant to reduce contact in bathrooms and dining areas.

Still, several employees feel they are being pressured to return to work, NBC News reported. One worker said that her supervisor told her that if she didn’t return to work as directed, she was in danger of being fired. Internal Tesla emails viewed by NBC said that employees who didn’t return to work would no longer receive unemployment insurance, and would have to take unpaid leave. A worker told NBC that staying away from people in the plant was difficult. “It’s hard to stay six feet from people,” the anonymous employee told the outlet. “It’s a production line. There’s a lot of people.” Another worker told The New York Times that the production line hadn’t changed much, making it difficult to avoid other workers.

That was echoed in comments to Joseph Geha, a reporter for the Bay Area News Group: “The work that we do requires us to constantly be in close proximity to people,” the worker said. (The negative views are not uniformly held: a worker told Geha that they were fine with the factory reopening.) Another worker told The San Jose Mercury News that tools used on the production line are shared and aren’t being cleaned or sanitized between uses.

“I think Tesla did a pretty good job, and that’s why I had it to the point where on May 18, Tesla would have opened.”

On one level, the kerfuffle is bewildering. Musk has spent years presenting himself as an enthusiastic acolyte of science. What’s more, in an interview with The New York Times on May 9th, an Alameda county official said that the county and Tesla had been close to an agreement to reopen the plant on May 18.

“We were working on a lot of policies and procedures to help operate that plant and quite frankly, I think Tesla did a pretty good job, and that’s why I had it to the point where on May 18, Tesla would have opened,” said Scott Haggerty, the county supervisor for the district where the Fremont plant operates, according to The New York Times. “I know Elon knew that. But he wanted it this week.”

The May 18 restart would have put Tesla squarely in line with other automakers’ efforts to reopen their plants. Mercedes-Benz fired up its Alabama facility on April 27. BMW’s South Carolina plant started up on May 4; GM began production on May 11, as did Honda, Subaru, and Volvo. Toyota planned to restart its US production this week. Fiat Chrysler will resume on May 18, as will Ford. Volkswagen has postponed starting up its plants indefinitely.

What’s more, car sales cratered in March. In April, though, they seemed to slightly recover, though sales were still down 50 percent compared with April 2019. So why start the fight with Alameda at all?

“As the world comes back online, Tesla will be competing against other automakers who are literally throwing out all the stops.”

Just before the coronavirus-related health orders closed plants, Tesla was launching its Model Y SUV. SUVs, along with pickup trucks, were among the few bright spots in the market these last few months, says Jessica Caldwell, an analyst for Edmunds. Dealers have also been offering remarkable incentives, such as zero percent interest loans for as long as seven years. Different areas in the world are recovering at different speeds, Caldwell points out. So Musk might want his factories up and running for when markets — in the US or elsewhere — recover. And Tesla makes cars at just two places: Shanghai and Fremont.

“If they’re not producing at either factory they have no global production,” Caldwell says. “And as the world comes back online, Tesla will be competing against other automakers who are literally throwing out all the stops.”

The Model Y is particularly important, says Karl Brauer, the executive publisher at Autotrader and Kelly Blue Book. “He’s got enough demand in the US and globally that he can probably sell most — if not every — Model Y about as fast as he can build them.”

“Elon rightfully feels that taking a non-conventional approach has served him relatively well.”

There’s another factor, and it’s political. Before starting his standoff with Alameda County, Musk was already agitating to open Fremont on a private call with President Donald Trump and some other CEOs. Musk told Trump that he did not view returning to work as a significant risk, and the president agreed, The Washington Post reported. SpaceX, Musk’s commercial space company, is heavily reliant on government contracts; if Musk were trying to curry favor with Trump, it wouldn’t be the first time.

There’s also Musk’s image to consider, says Brauer. “Elon rightfully feels that taking a non-conventional approach has served him relatively well for the last 15 years that he’s been at Tesla,” Brauer says. “So if it’s unconventional to break a government mandate if he doesn’t think it’s a necessary level of caution, it plays into his image and his customer base, which likes his unconventional approach.”

But the question may be if Musk loses more than he gains by aligning himself with Trump and others who have persistently tried to convince Americans that stay-home orders aren’t necessary, Brauer says. He might gain new customers — people who ordinarily might not care about electric vehicles but want to support Musk for pushing back against government overreach. Longtime Tesla customers, though, might feel alienated, particularly those who are more collectively-minded.

“I drive a fucking Tesla.”

Cullen, the epidemiologist, is among that group. “I drive a fucking Tesla,” Cullen tells The Verge. “When the cheap ones came out, I bought one. I love the car. I don’t love Musk.”

If Musk reopens Tesla successfully, and without sickening his workers, we should all expect an “I told you so!” tweetstorm. But if Fremont workers get sick and bring COVID-19 with them into the places where they live, seeding outbreaks like we’ve seen with meatpacking plants and other close-quarters facilities, Musk stands to lose a tremendous amount of confidence the public has placed in him. Historically, Musk has been a connoisseur of risk — but now he’s gambling with his legacy.

If Alameda County’s COVID-19 case counts spike two or three weeks from now, Musk’s role in seeding an epidemic will likely be the first line in his obituary. Under the Great Man theory of history, the man in question takes all the blame.",1
259,259,336,GoPro cuts 20 percent of workforce after being hit hard by pandemic,"GoPro is laying off more than 20 percent of its workforce, over 200 employees, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has announced. The move is part of an attempt to reduce operating expenses by $100 million the year, and the company plans to reduce non-headcount related operating expenses to $250 million in 2021. GoPro added that its founder and CEO, Nicholas Woodman, will not be paid a salary for the remainder of the year, and that the company will shift more towards a direct-to-consumer sales model going forward.

The restructuring comes as GoPro has started to recover after its ill-fated move into the drone market. Released in late 2016 after several delays, the GoPro Karma was a basic drone that failed to impress, and GoPro ended up quitting the drone business just over a year later. Last year, there were signs the company had shaken off the pain of the move off the back of the success of the Hero 7.

GoPro says it sold 700,000 cameras in the first quarter and expects its 2020 product and service roadmap to be unaffected by operational cuts, according to Bloomberg.

Correction: This article originally stated that GoPro was reducing non-headcount operating expenses by $250 million in 2021. This is incorrect. GoPro is in fact reducing non-headcount operating expenses to $250 million in 2021. The Verge regrets the error.",1
471,471,577,"Doctor, nurse practitioner dipping into own pockets to provide rural health care in Texas","The state of Texas has three of the biggest cities in America, but it has not suffered the same number of COVID-19 infections as other large states. As of Friday, Texas was ranked 9th. But Texas also ranks near the bottom when it comes to the percentage of residents it's tested -- and that worries some doctors and nurses, especially those in rural areas of the state.

Many small hospitals and clinics around the country are fearful they don't have the staff and budget to survive the pandemic.

Among those trying to prop up the system in Texas is Sid Miller, the commissioner of agriculture, who wears many hats. He came to our interview wearing a custom made white one.

Sid Miller

Sid Miller: Well, I'm the commissioner of agriculture. Course we oversee, you know, cows, plows, and sows, but that's-- I'm also the Commissioner of the State Office of Rural Health. So we-- we're-- we're trying to keep 163 rural hospitals open and from, you know, going out of business.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Any sense of how many hospitals-- rural hospitals are at risk right now in Texas?

Sid Miller: Well, of the 163 we have, 60 of 'em have less than 30 days' cash on hand.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Whoa.

Sid Miller: Yeah, some of them-- actually, we had one filing for bankruptcy this week.

Sharyn Alfonsi: A hospital?

Sid Miller: In Alpine, Texas, and the parent company are filing for bankruptcy. So we've already--

Sharyn Alfonsi: Did this push them over the edge, the COVID?

Sid Miller: Yes, it-- it pushed them over the edge. And I'm-- I'm afraid this pandemic-- we're gonna-- we're gonna continue to lose health care providers in rural Texas and across the nation.

Low reimbursement rates and high numbers of uninsured patients have forced 128 hospitals that served 6 million people across the nation to close in the last decade. Twenty-one hospitals were in Texas, more than any other state.

That's left one out of five rural Texas counties without a doctor.

Elizabeth Ellis is a nurse practitioner.

When we met her she was tearing around her East Texas farm with her four-legged sidearm named Pistol.

The clinic she owns is in Bedias, Texas. Population 443. Lately, her job includes administering COVID-19 tests in the clinic parking lot.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Has coronavirus reached out here?

Elizabeth Ellis: Yes, it has reached Grimes County.

Sharyn Alfonsi: That's shocking. You know, driving through here I definitely saw more cows than people.

Elizabeth Ellis: A lot of our community members have to leave the county for jobs. That puts them at risk. So it was inevitable that at some point in time it was gonna hit the county.

Elizabeth Ellis

So far, Grimes County has reported 19 COVID cases and one death. The county is about an hour and a half northwest of Houston. 400,000 acres of it are covered with farms and ranches. Social distancing is built into the landscape and enforced by barbed wire.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Tell me what the challenge is of providing health care in a rural community like this.

Elizabeth Ellis: We have larger elderly population. And they have sometimes ten, sometimes 12, even 20 chronic disease states and comorbid conditions. They're poor, predominantly on Medicaid. I have a tremendous agricultural group of farmers and families that are in the gap. They can't afford insurance.

Sharyn Alfonsi: When you say ""in the gap,"" what do you mean by that?

Elizabeth Ellis: They are not quite poor enough to be on Medicaid and they don't make enough money to yet afford insurance.

Sharyn Alfonsi: So as we're talking about coronavirus, we know the elderly are at higher risk. We know people with preexisting conditions are at higher risk. And that's this community.

Elizabeth Ellis: It is this community.

Now, many of those patients are too afraid to go to the clinic, others simply can't get there.

Elizabeth Ellis: For many of these people, transportation is a liability. They don't have it or they can't dri--, they're elderly, they have conditions and they can't drive.

Increasingly, Ellis's rounds require a full tank of gas. She negotiates dusty roads.

To check up on patients at their homes.

Coronavirus in rural Texas: The high cost of low technology

Sharyn Alfonsi: So if you get a bunch of coronavirus cases, if there's some kind of community spread here, what happens? What do you do?

Elizabeth Ellis: I'm gonna be overwhelmed. And what frightens me is that all of America's critical access hospitals, especially here in Texas, are at risk of closing.

Critical access hospitals are the health care outposts many rural communities rely on. The drive to an emergency room can take an hour or more.

Dr. Leighann Falcon: I take care of people I went to school with, their parents. I take care of former teachers. They may go to the same school as my kids. They may go to my gym, and so we just, we-- we know everyone.

Dr. Leighann Falcon is one of 10 full-time doctors at Memorial Medical Center in Calhoun County. It serves 26,000 people on the Gulf Coast of Texas.

Dr. Falcon also runs a clinic just down the street.

Sharyn Alfonsi: You hear about rural health care in Texas and it being such a dire situation here, and hospitals closing and doctors leaving. Why? Why is it so bad in Texas?

Dr. Leighann Falcon: We lead the nation in a lotta things, including uninsured. So about 9% of people are uninsured across the country, give or take, and in Texas, it's more than double that. Our little hospital down the street on any given year can provide up to $6 million in uncompensated care. And it's hard to run a business when you're giving away $6 million a year.

Dr. Leighann Falcon

And this year, the pandemic has pushed Calhoun County's hospital further into the red. Like many states, preparing for the pandemic, Texas cancelled non-essential medical procedures for 30 days to expand hospital capacity around the state. Things like colonoscopies and lab services that usually make up half the revenue at the state's rural hospitals.

When we visited Calhoun County's hospital, there were no COVID patients, but few other patients either. We noticed the ER was silent and most beds were empty, partly because fear of the virus is discouraging people from going to the ER.

An administrator told us they were down to seven days worth of cash. Revenue from elective procedures, a primary moneymaker for the hospital, has almost disappeared.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Can, you know, the hospitals, the clinics survive this?

Dr. Leighann Falcon: Without assistance, they won't survive. And if our hospital were to close, it would devastate our community. It would-- it would be horrible.

Sharyn Alfonsi: How so?

Dr. Leighann Falcon: Well, first of all, there's just a lack of care. Again, we're already short physicians. We're short for health care. If you have an emergency, and the nearest emergency room is over 35 miles away, that's not a good thing.

Dr. Falcon, a single mother of three, has started skipping paychecks to pay her staff.

And there's another problem. Doctors and nurses must treat every patient like they may have COVID-19. Now, they're running low on personal protective equipment.

Dr. Leighann Falcon: It's empty.

Sharyn Alfonsi: It's empty.

Dr. Leighann Falcon: Yeah, and I never thought I would see that.

A nurse told us they are reusing masks and mixing their own cleaning supplies. The number of COVID-19 cases is still rising in their county. Last week, it was up to 30. And preparing for the possibility of more is further draining the budget.

Dr. Leighann Falcon: Our hospital is financially struggling on a good day. So now this normal equipment which we probably pay, what, a dollar for, 50 cents for, and now we are paying 20 times that. It's just crazy.

Dr. Leighann Falcon takes correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi's temperature

Sharyn Alfonsi: Are you? Have prices gone up that much?

Erin Clevenger, RN: Yeah, so usually, the masks like we're wearing, these are-- like Dr. Falcon's wearing…we pay about 6 cents each normally, we are paying up to $1.20 each now.

Lately, Sid Miller, the agriculture commissioner who oversees a $680 million state budget, has taken to delivering hand sanitizer in the back of his truck. Loading it up in Austin, driving it to the country.

Sharyn Alfonsi: I think a lot of people think because some areas of Texas are so rural and so remote that COVID won't affect them, won't bother them. There's natural social distancing.

Sid Miller: Well, you know, that's simply not true. The single hottest spot in the United States is in South Dakota, of all places. You know, had a beef packing plant up there. Well, I think the last count I saw was, like, 650 cases in that one town where those-- you know, areas of South Dakota. So that-- that-- that dog won't hunt. It just doesn't hold true

After we spoke to Miller, a similar hotspot surfaced nearly nine hours from Austin, at a meatpacking plant in a city called Cactus in the Texas panhandle.

More than 350 people have tested positive and three died in surrounding Moore County, which now has the highest COVID infection rate in the state.

The sole 25-bed hospital in the county only had two ventilators. The CEO of the hospital used his four-seater plane to pick up two more ventilators and the state supplied another three.

Sid Miller: The one thing that-- that's limited on these-- rural hospitals is ventilators. Some of 'em may have one. Some of 'em may have two. We've had to go back in and dig out those that are in storage, you know, and refurbish 'em and get them ready. So, we still don't quite have a handle on the ventilators in these rural hospitals.

In March, he asked the Texas governor for $40 million to prop up rural health care centers during the pandemic, arguing if the hospitals fail, the communities will too.

Sid Miller: When a hospital closes up, the manufacturing leaves too because they have to have health care. You have-- you have to have three things. You have to have a financial institution, you have to have health care, and you have to have church. If you don't have any of those three, the community starts to dry up.

On Monday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced he was allowing his stay at home order to expire and some Texas businesses to reopen.



Greg Abbott: That executive order has done its job to slow the growth of COVID-19.

Three days later, Texas had its single highest number of COVID deaths in a day with 50. Abbott is now prioritizing testing in rural communities. But he has not publicly said whether he'll grant any additional funding to rural clinics and declined our requests for an interview.

Dr. Leighann Falcon: Being younger and naïve, I guess I just never realized during times like this when something would happen, how much we would really have to rely on ourselves and kinda cowboy up and do things on our own.

In March, Congress approved $100 billion for hospitals and in April, President Trump signed a relief package that promised another $75 billion.

But so far, the hospital in Calhoun County, Texas, has received about $600,000 of aid, which they say will cover three weeks payroll. And nurse practitioner Elizabeth Ellis has received a total of $800.

On Friday afternoon, the Trump administration promised to rush $10 billion specifically for rural health care providers. Nurse Ellis told us she'll believe it when she sees it.

Elizabeth Ellis: Right now, you know, I'm-- I'm losin' $10,000 plus--

Sharyn Alfonsi: $10,000 a month?

Elizabeth Ellis: Yes this is my retirement. I'm using my retirement,

Sharyn Alfonsi: No one would blame you if you said, ""I've had enough. I can't keep diggin' into my retirement."" Why don't you?

Elizabeth Ellis: Because I believe in what we are doing with my heart. We will do our best to maintain. But it won't last for very long. I'm-- I'm at risk every day right now of having to make that difficult decision.

1389,1396,1938,US militarizes the Caribbean Sea to surround Venezuela,"Submitted by InfoBrics, authored by Lucas Leiroz, research fellow in international law at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro…

Recently, the number of American ships and planes in the Caribbean Sea has increased exponentially. The most likely hypothesis so far is that there will be an attempt to block Venezuela, as the military flow in the region began to grow only after Iran announced the sending of oil ships to the Bolivarian country. On May 14, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said that the boats that take gasoline to Venezuelan ports are being persecuted by the American Navy, which is worsening with the arrival of Iranian ships. The White House has already reported that it has taken retaliation against this cooperation between Venezuelans and Iranians, but no further information has been provided on the military operations being carried out. The United States has announced sanctions against any company that participates in the supply of gasoline to Venezuela, which is causing a structural crisis of fuel scarcity in the South American country.

In addition to the blockade, there is a humanitarian issue, as American measures are inducing a major economic recession in the Bolivarian Republic. It has also been reported by the Venezuelan government that the tax imposed by the United States is affecting the country’s food supply, which is already having an effect on society. With a crisis and the siege being imposed on Caracas, how do Venezuelans use to deal with the advancing pandemic of new coronaviruses? How can the Bolivarian government manage a major economic and social crisis with imminent health danger? It is just the American strategy: to raise a siege and provoke the Venezuelan national collapse, inducing, through coercion, Nicolás Maduro’s government to accept changes in the regime for the benefit of Washington.

The naval blockade is just one of the measures the United States is taking to overthrow Nicolás Maduro’s legitimate government. A few days ago, an attempted invasion against the country, carried out by Colombian mercenaries on American speedboats, was neutralized, with several terrorists arrested. Apparently, the sea will be the path by which Washington will try to overthrow Maduro, insisting on the military operation as solution of international controversies. The case also indicates the presence of the so-called “extermination war”, an ancient warlike practice in which a country is surrounded and kept under block by the navy of another nation, preventing the arrival of goods and food in port areas, affecting the population as a whole, indirectly leading thousands of people to hunger, misery and death. Basically, this is exactly the American goal in Venezuela with the current blockade. Without formally declaring war, Washington adopts an even more insidious strategy than traditional military confrontation.

However, there is yet another important factor – and above Venezuela – behind the American interest in militarizing the Caribbean Sea. Since at least the First World War, the USA has occupied a position of undisputed supremacy on the seas, which allowed Washington, in time, to exercise a role of “global naval police”. However, this reality is changing day after day, since the world is already beginning to contemplate a response from nations to American naval power, especially in Asia.

In the Asian continent, China and Iran are challenging the American Navy. In China, the progress of the Navy is absolute, with the Chinese having already succeeded, for the first time in its history, to overcome the International Date Line and concluding military tests in spaces traditionally occupied by the American maritime forces. In Iran, the maneuvering of small vessels against large American ships is daring. Recently, some sources have informed that Tehran will produce nuclear submarines, with the aim of increasing its naval power.

The United States has spoken out several times condemning its opponents in China and Iran, but nothing has been done other than the mere war of words. In practice, it is difficult to deny that the United States has a naval power today that is much less powerful than it was decades ago. Washington did not attack its rivals in Asia simply because it could not handle a counteroffensive from Beijing or Tehran – at least not without a big material loss as a result.

All of these factors are contributing to a redirection of the American Navy’s strategic policies. No longer able to keep its global power intact, Washington manages its forces for the southern portions of the American continent itself, guaranteeing a regional space of power. However, in the Americas the opposition to US possible aggression will be fierce and will have international support from other continents.

864,864,1035,Tanglewood Has Canceled Its 2020 Live Season,"Tanglewood Has Canceled Its 2020 Live Season

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of the Boston Symphony Orchestra Courtesy of the Boston Symphony Orchestra

Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra [BSO] and a popular draw for tourists in the Berkshire Mountains, has canceled its 2020 live performance season due to the coronavirus, the BSO announced on Friday.

Instead, the famed summer music festival is moving some of its offerings online, in the form of video and audio streams of archival performances and newly created material. Audiences will have to pay to stream some of that content, either single performances or in packages; other offerings will be free. Those streamed performances are scheduled to include cellist Yo-Yo Ma, pianist Daniil Trifonov and the Boston Symphony Chamber Players. Archival performances will include those by the BSO.

Along with its classical performances, Tanglewood is a pop music venue. The planned 2020 schedule included performances by James Taylor, Trey Anastasio, Brandi Carlile, Judy Collins and Arlo Guthrie, John Legend and Ringo Starr, as well as a taping of the NPR game show Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me! Several of those shows have already been rescheduled for the summer of 2021.

The Lenox, Mass., institution is also the home of two prestigious training programs for young classical musicians: the Tanglewood Music Center, for college-aged and emerging-professional instrumentalists and singers, and a program for high school-aged musicians affiliated with Boston University. Many of the world's most famed classical musicians have been part of those programs, either as teachers or students; for example, Leonard Bernstein was in residence at Tanglewood for 50 years.

Tanglewood also represents a substantial portion of the BSO's annual income — according to the symphony's most recent available financial report (from 2017-18), Tanglewood brought in more revenue than either the Boston Symphony's regular concert season or the Boston Pops.

The BSO has already been forced to take significant measures to curtail its financial losses due to the pandemic — which, as of mid-April, were some $6.2 million in revenue after the cancellation of about 130 events, including the entire Boston Pops season.

Last month, the orchestra announced it was furloughing 70 of its 300 full-time employees, and its musicians took pay cuts. Additionally, BSO president and CEO Mark Volpe took a 50% salary reduction, and its music director, Andris Nelsons, was not paid for canceled performances.

Tanglewood was founded in 1937; the only other times that the festival has been curtailed or canceled completely were during World War II.",1
1243,1244,1613,Uber Eats launches 'Family Style Meals' to save your family money on delivery orders,"Uber's food delivery platform is launching a tool that lets families get more value and savings when placing meal orders at a time when more Americans are financially squeezed.

The ride-hailing giant announced the new feature called ""Family Style Meals"" on Wednesday. It's located in the Uber Eats app and features meals meant for sharing.

Some participating restaurants will offer a curated menu that lists a combination of items offering value and savings, the company said. Others will focus primarily on larger portions that can feed multiple members of your family.

""We know that these are tough times for families, whether they rely on school meals to feed their children or are dealing with the pressures of working from home and cooking three meals a day,"" said Kalyan Kuchimanchi, director of regional operations for the U.S. and Canada at Uber Eats.

Apple is reopening some stores this week:Expect to wear a mask, have temperature checked

McDonald's:Hundreds of chain's workers plan Wednesday strike over COVID-19 protections

Family Meals is launching in select markets to start. Suburbs surrounding New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami are among the first to get the update. San Francisco, Washington, Dallas, Boston, and Houston, as well as Connecticut and New Jersey will follow and a full rollout across the country is expected by June.

Also part of Uber's announcement is a free ride donation to local school districts and youth organizations to pass out to food-insecure families. The donation of 100,000 rides is part of a broader 10 million free ride-commitment during the pandemic.

The move comes at a time when millions of Americans have been laid off and had their household income slashed due to the coronavirus fallout. The situation is particularly dire for people with low-wage jobs that cannot be performed at home.

Nearly 37 million Americans were food insecure in 2018. That number could rise by 17.1 million in the wake of the pandemic, according to Feeding America.

736,736,896,Navy sailors cleared to return to USS Theodore Roosevelt test positive for COVID-19 in latest sign of trouble,"Five sailors who were cleared to return to the US Navy aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt after contracting COVID-19 tested positive again and have been taken off the carrier, a defense official told Insider Thursday.

Roughly 3,000 sailors who had been removed from the ship have returned, and for them to do so, they had to have two negative tests.

In addition to the five sailors who were removed after testing positive, another 18 sailors were also taken off the ship because they had been in close contact.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Five US Navy sailors who were cleared to return to the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt after two negative tests have tested positive for COVID-19, a defense official told Insider Thursday.

All five of the sailors have been removed from the ship, as have 18 other sailors who were in close contact with them.

The sailors, a defense official explained, had previously tested positive for the virus and were removed from the ship and placed in isolation on Guam. All five sailors completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine and tested negative twice before they were allowed to return to the ship.

The outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt began in late March with only a few cases. As of April 30, there were 1,102 cases among sailors assigned to the ship.

The virus upended the carrier's Pacific deployment, forcing it into port in Guam, where it has remained for over a month as the Navy works to get the situation under control.

Over 80% of the carrier's crew of roughly 4,800 sailors were evacuated ashore and placed in isolation in hotels and other facilities.

In recent weeks, sailors have begun returning to the ship, but only on the condition that they meet the health requirements.

""You have to go through two different checks plus being COVID tested twice,"" Capt. Carlos Sardiello, commanding officer of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, told CBS News earlier this month. ""We sideline sailors for the slightest thing. Sniffles.""

But there are some challenges.

The New York Times reported Thursday that one sailor hid a loss of smell, a key symptom of COVID-19, from medical examiners for days after returning to the ship.

In response, a sailor in the medical department sent out a message begging crewmembers to be honest. ""Please stress the importance of being truthful so we don't potentially have Covid+ aboard this ship,"" the email reportedly read.

The latest development in the USS Theodore Roosevelt saga comes as roughly 3,000 sailors have returned to the USS Theodore Roosevelt and is an indication that the fight for a healthy ship is yet to be won.",1

The Theodore Roosevelt has been battling a coronavirus outbreak that saw more than 1,000 sailors test positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

After most of the crew was evacuated ashore, thousands of sailors have started to return to the ship. But, the Navy reports that a number of sailors who were cleared to get back on after testing negative twice have retested positive for COVID-19.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The US Navy reports that the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, which was sidelined by a severe coronavirus outbreak, has had a sailor diagnosed with tuberculosis, another infectious disease.

""In the course of the ship's rigorous infection surveillance, a single active case of TB was identified and diagnosed,"" Pacific Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Myers Vasquez told Politico. ""The individual has been removed from the ship, isolated, and will remain under the direct care of the naval health system until cleared by doctors.""

Unlike the coronavirus, tuberculosis is a bacterial infection, but like the virus that crippled the USS Theodore Roosevelt, it can have a devastating effect on the lungs.

A coronavirus outbreak aboard the aircraft carrier upended its Pacific deployment and forced the ship into port in Guam, where the carrier has been since late March.

As the number of cases climbed, reaching 1,102 by the end of April, the Navy evacuated over 80% of the carrier's crew of roughly 4,800 sailors ashore and placed them in isolation.

In recent weeks, sailors have begun returning to the ship, but only on the condition that they meet the health requirements. As of Thursday, 2,900 sailors had returned to the carrier.

Pacific Fleet said in a statement on Thursday that five sailors who had been cleared to return to the USS Theodore Roosevelt had retested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and were removed from the ship.

The five sailors had previously tested positive for the virus and were removed from the ship and placed in isolation on Guam. All five sailors completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine and tested negative twice before they were allowed to return to the ship.

The number of sailors who have retested positive for COVID-19 after getting back on the ship has more than doubled, Politico reported, revealing that a total of 13 sailors have retested positive.

The latest developments aboard the carrier represent new setbacks as the USS Theodore Roosevelt fights for a healthy ship that get once again get underway.

""We are committed to taking every measure possible to protect the health of our force,"" Cmdr. Vasquez told Insider in an emailed statement this week.

""As we continue to learn more about this virus,"" he said, ""the Navy will aggressively respond to COVID virus in accordance with the latest guidance and best practices, and then evolve and adapt as experience is gained.""",1
464,464,569,"TAIWAN: No Lockdowns, No Closed Businesses, Non-WHO Member, and Relatively Unaffected by COVID-19","

Originally published on www.healthimpactnews.com

Johns Hopkins University had predicted that Taiwan would have the second most COVID-19 cases in the world, due to its close proximity to Mainland China.

But astonishingly, in spite of being only 80 miles from the coast of China with over 400,000 of its 24 million citizens working in China, as of mid-April, the country only had 400 cases of COVID-19, and only 6 deaths. And the vast majority of their 400 cases came into the country from abroad.

All of this has happened without shutting down the country with lock downs, and with almost all of its businesses continuing to operate. Is Taiwan doing something else the rest of the world is largely missing?

This question will no doubt be asked for months or even years into the future, but it is a question well worth asking, given the devastating effects to the economy that have resulted from more restrictive measures such as the United States took.

The first thing to note is that while President Trump is now looking seriously at pulling out of the World Health Organization, Taiwan was never part of it. They were not allowed to join due to the WHO's pro-China stance.

According to the Taipei Times, Taiwan's CDC tried to warn China and WHO on December 31, 2019 about possible human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus, while China was still denying that such transmission was possible.

That same day, Taiwan started policies to monitor travel from China to reduce the chance of having the coronvirus come into their country. They were one of the first countries to restrict travel from China at their borders.

Taiwan had bad experiences from the 2003 SARS (another coronavirus) outbreak in China, and as a result their hospitals were well supplied with equipment to handle any outbreaks. This SARS situation had reportedly taught them to have a healthy distrust in China and the World Health Organization to accurately report facts, and to have their own plan in place for future outbreaks.

But unlike the U.S. and many other countries, Taiwan did not quarantine the entire nation. They focused on quarantining travelers coming in from abroad in their own homes, while the rest of the nation went about their business, with some restrictions in place such as wearing face masks, and practicing social distancing.

It is hard to argue with their reported results so far, with so few actual cases and very few deaths. They kept the country open, and did not destroy their economy.

John Ransom, reporting for TownHall Finance writes:

Protests in the streets, oil trading at negative numbers, rapidly spiraling unemployment, locked-down international travel and trade: I think we can all agree that by any barometer, including these, the world has failed the Wuhan flu test. Why the world's answer to the China flu has been so disastrously wrong, ill-thought out and ignorant to reality can be left to future post-mortems. But after spending literally trillions on public health over the decades to prevent just such an occurrence, it's clear by now that the world's investment in public health professionals was wasted. We can debate whether the cost was worth it, but there is no denying that the cost has been beyond anyone's imagining. Some may argue that in such a crisis, experts faced a no-win situation where they had to either trade lives for the economy or the economy for lives. To that I give a one-word answer: Taiwan. Taiwan is the other ""China"". It's a small island off the southern coast of China, called the Republic of China (ROC). It was created as a bastion of ""free"" China as the Communist Party took over mainland China (PRC). The island may be small, but the country is a regional and worldwide powerhouse. It's the 21st largest economy in the world (19th if counting by PPP), despite having a population of just 24 million. It ranks 11th in GDP per capita, comparable to Denmark and Sweden. It's also an important partner with Communist China as one of the leading investors, trading partners and bankers for the PRC. Consequently, Taiwan hosts quite a bit of contact with the PRC. For comparison sake, the United Sates saw about 3 million visitors from China in 2018, while Taiwan hosted 2.6 million visitors from China in 2018. That's why the results from Taiwan in fighting China's Wuhan flu--as they call it in Taiwan--is so extraordinary. Worldwide there have been 321 cases of COVID-19, or Wuhan flu, per million people. In Taiwan there have been just 0.3 cases per million people for a total of 422 cases, with only six total deaths. Equally important is that while the Taiwanese economy has been damaged by the global shutdown, their domestic economy and society has remained open. (Source and Full Article Here.)

We report these results as a comparison to what other actions have been taken in other countries, that have had far more disastrous results. We are not necessarily endorsing everything that Taiwan has done, just reporting the facts about their response and their results so far.

Many questions are still unanswered. Did the actions the Taiwan Government take cause a much lower rate of reported infections of COVID-19? Or are there other factors involved that kept their infection rates lower? Since the SARS outbreak more than 15 years ago was so severe there, was there some natural immunity against coronaviruses involved? Did their location closer to the equator with more sunlight and warmer temperatures this time of year play a factor?

About the only thing we do know for sure, is that the vaccine gods and their global leaders like Bill Gates and Dr. Fauci and the WHO cannot take credit for Taiwan's success, because they never were able to successfully develop a vaccine for SARS, and they have successfully kept Taiwan out of the WHO.

Writer Marc A. Thiessen offers his perspective:

This pandemic has provided us with a clinical trial in the healing power of freedom. We can now compare two control groups in the form of two Chinese societies -- one free and democratic, the other under the grip of a brutal totalitarian dictatorship. Totalitarian China has not only been ravaged by the virus but has also spread the contagion to our shores. Free China has defeated it. The lesson is clear: COVID-19 grew in the cesspool of Chinese Communist tyranny. The antidote to the coronavirus is freedom. (Source.)

111,111,159,"Actor Mark Blum dies of coronavirus complications; starred in ‘Desperately Seeking Susan,’ ‘You’","Veteran stage and screen actor Mark Blum has died from complications of coronavirus.

Blum, known for his work in movies like “Desperately Seeking Susan” and “Crocodile Dundee,” as well as a host of Broadway and off-Broadway theater productions and television works, was 69. He is survived by his wife, actress Janet Zarish.

Rebecca Damon, vice president of SAG-AFTRA, confirmed Blum’s death: ”It is with such deep sorrow that I’m writing to share the news that our friend and former board member Mark Blum has passed away as a result of complications from the coronavirus.”

News of Blum’s death follows the announcement Tuesday of the coronavirus-related death of Broadway playwright Terrence McNally.

Blum made his Broadway debut in 1977’s “The Merchant” and appeared in works ranging from “Lost in Yonkers” to both revivals of Gore Vidal’s “The Best Man.”

His last appearance on the Great White Way was in 2013’s “The Assembled Parties.”

An actor to the end, his last off-Broadway appearance was in September’s “Fern Hill.”

On the silver screen, he was known for “Crocodile Dundee,” “Desperately Seeking Susan” and “Shattered Glass,” and was a staple on television, including a recent role in the thriller “You” as bookshop owner Mr. Moody. He also was featured on “Fraiser,” Hulu’s ”Mozart in the Jungle” and HBO’s “The Sopranos,” among many others.

Outpourings of love peppered social media Thursday morning as news of Blum’s death spread.

Playwrights Horizons announced his death on Twitter, saying, “With love and heavy hearts, Playwrights Horizons pays tribute to Mark Blum, a dear longtime friend and a consummate artist who passed this week. Thank you, Mark, for all you brought to our theater, and to theaters and audiences across the world. We will miss you.”

Damon’s tribute to Blum continued: “Mark was a dedicated Screen Actors Guild and SAG-AFTRA board member serving from 2007-2013, a passionate champion for merger, and a tireless advocate for members. Those of us lucky enough to have known him will treasure our memories of a gifted actor, a master teacher, a loyal friend and a beautiful human.

“On a personal note — I always appreciated Mark’s clear perception of complex situations. He always spoke the truth and did a great service in informing members of our community about the ins and outs of the union whenever he had the opportunity.

“Mark was smart, funny, and a true actor’s actor. He will be deeply missed. Thinking of you all. Please #stayhome. #COVID19”

Actress Judith Light tweeted, “Mark Blum, so generous, so kind, so humble, so talented. Our time together in the play ‘The Assembled Parties’ at MTC was a true joy. May he rest in peace knowing that he transformed the lives of so many and was cherished by so many; me among them.”

Actor Josh Radnor said, “When I was in drama school Mark Blum was exactly the kind of actor I aspired to be: constantly employed, deeply respected, total mensch. Gutted to hear of his passing. His wife Janet Zarish was my acting teacher at NYU. They were the loveliest couple. My heart breaks for her.”

Playwright Heidi Schreck wrote, “Oh this is devastating. The brilliant and generous Mark Blum was such a life giving force in New York theater. We will miss you dearly.”

512,512,633,Coronavirus epidemic in Russia shows no signs of decline,"Covid-19 in Russia: Plateau is nowhere in sight

Over the past 24 hours, 10,559 new cases of coronavirus infection have been detected in 82 regions of Russia.

Most of the cases were reported in – 5,858, the Moscow region - 829, St. Petersburg - 312, Nizhny Novgorod region - 272.

181 cases of infection were detected in the Republic of Dagestan, 136 in the Murmansk region,

105 each in the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic and Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug,

102 - in the Republic of Tatarstan.

In other regions of the country, less than a hundred new cases were registered.

On the eve of the meeting of the work group of the State Council for the struggle against the spread of coronavirus, officials discussed an opportunity to introduce “mask regime” throughout Russia. A day earlier, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that in order to remove quarantine restrictions, one needs to know the dynamics of the spread of the virus on May 11 and take into account peculiarities of Russian regions.

On May 6, it was reported that Olga Lyubimova, Russia’s Minister of Culture, became infected with the coronavirus. The minister is going through the mild course of the disease, so there is no need to hospitalize her yet. Olga Lyubimova has thus become a third member of the Russian government, who was infected with COVID-19.

On April 30, it was reported that the Prime Minister of Russia Mikhail Mishustin was infected with coronavirus. Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov has been appointed acting head of government. On May 1, Vladimir Yakushev, the Minister of Construction, Housing and Communal Services of Russia, was also hospitalized with coronavirus.

Russians persistently violate self-isolation regime

Meanwhile, Russia will have to experience a new surge in the incidence of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, Ivan Konovalov, assistant professor of infectious diseases in children at the Russian National Medical University named after Pirogov said.

According to the professor, Russia will see a sharp growth of infections in one or two weeks because most Russians violate self-isolation regime during May holidays. “No plateau is yet in sight as it requires no growth trend for several consecutive weeks,” the specialist said.

If citizens start taking to the streets thinking that everyone will catch COVID-19 sooner or later, the number of seriously ill patients will start snowballing. Such a trend is especially dangerous for regions where hospitals are already overwhelmed, while many doctors quit their jobs and leave being unable to cope with hard conditions of work.",0

Co-Chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Bill Gates speaks at the panel Building Human Capital: A Project for the World, during the World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings, in Washington, Saturday, April 21, 2018. AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana

In a 2015 TED talk, Gates said the world was ""not ready for the next epidemic.""

And in a 2018 discussion about epidemics hosted by the Massachusetts Medical Society and the New England Journal of Medicine, Gates said a pandemic could happen within the next decade.

He presented a simulation by the Institute for Disease Modeling which found that a new flu like the one that killed 50 million people in the 1918 pandemic would now most likely kill 30 million people within six months.

The likelihood that such a disease will appear continues to rise in our interconnected world, he said, whether it happens naturally or is created as a weaponized disease.

""In the case of biological threats, that sense of urgency is lacking,"" he said. ""The world needs to prepare for pandemics in the same serious way it prepares for war.""

Gates said in an April interview with the Financial Times that a viral outbreak will likely happen ""every 20 years or so."" The coronavirus pandemic outbreak will cause future governments to have ""standby diagnostics, deep antiviral libraries, and early warning systems,"" he added.

""The cost of doing all those things well is very small compared to what we're going through here,"" he said. ""And so now people realize, 'OK, there really is a meaningful probability every 20 years or so with lots of world travel that one of these [viruses] will come along.' And so the citizens expect the government to make it a priority.""",1
159,159,218,How McCormick Place is being transformed into a massive field hospital for COVID-19 patients,"He’s a three-star general whose jobs have included building up the Afghan police and armed forces, restoring electricity to war-torn Iraq and helping states recover after devastating hurricanes.

On Thursday, Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, commanding general of the Army Corps of Engineers, was in Chicago at McCormick Place, where he’s in charge of putting up a massive field hospital for COVID-19 patients facing a different kind of catastrophe.

Traveling with his staff microbiologist, Semonite, 62, gave elbow bumps to those in the small group greeting him.

He’s overseeing nine such projects, with many more expected. On Wednesday, he was in Detroit. Then, he flew to Illinois to meet with Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a “phenomenal lady,” he said. Thursday morning, he toured McCormick Place before jumping on a small jet to visit another city.

Semonite said he’s prioritizing the Corps’ projects based on the rate of growth of the virus in each city and how many hospital beds are needed.

The numbers that tell the story: Our coronavirus data tracking On our Coronavirus Data page, you’ll find a collection of graphs, charts and maps tracing the spread of the virus, tracking test results and plotting the impact on individual counties. Check back daily for updated totals.

“At the end of the day, though, the single biggest reason why we would come to Chicago or somewhere else is that governor feels that there’s a very, very critical requirement,” Semonite said.

Pritzker is “very, very focused on being able to try to take care of this town,” Semonite said.

New York was the model for the Corps’ efforts after the Javits convention center was recently converted into a hospital for sick and injured people who aren’t infected with COVID-19. A Navy hospital ship is housing patients sent from Javits.

The Army Corps is building nine such projects across the country with a total of 9,500 beds, according to Semonite, who said he expects to sign contracts in the next two days for another eight projects with 4,000 more beds.

“We’ve looked at almost 600 different facilities,” he said.

About a week ago, Semonite said he was notified by the secretary of the Army that Pritzker was “very, very concerned about the bed shortage up here.”

A division commander, Major Gen. Mark Toy, then met with Pritzker, and construction was launched on the McCormick Place’“alternative care facility,” which is short of a full-blown hospital.

Three exhibition halls at the convention center are being converted into medical wings, one of which will have 500 beds ready to use Friday, Semonite said.

Another 2,500 beds will be installed in stages to meet what officials say could be a peak in coronavirus diagnoses in Chicago around mid-April. The buildout is being paid for with $15 million in federal emergency funding.

People with varying degrees of coronavirus complications will be housed in each of the three converted exhibition halls.

The state is in charge of staffing the facility with health-care professionals. Pritzker has said the state is asking for volunteers and hiring people from contracting services. He said enough workers have been hired to staff at least 500 beds.

Officials have said they also were working to create temporary bed capacity at the shuttered MetroSouth Hospital in Blue Island and the Elgin site where Sherman Hospital was before being demolished.

In Chicago, United Center is being used for food distribution, first-responder staging and collecting medical supplies.

Walsh Construction is building the infrastructure for the field hospital at Place.

Illinois National Guard troops are assembling the beds and other equipment.

Semonite said the project is based on one of four standard designs for retrofitting big spaces like convention centers, vacant hospitals, dorms and sports arenas. Seattle’s CenturyLink Field, where the Seahawks play, also is being retrofitted.

The Chicago Sun-Times wasn’t allowed to tour the field hospital inside McCormick Place,, which Semonite described as a series of three-walled pods with a curtain at each opening. The metal-braced walls are the same ones vendors use during trade shows, he said. Each pod has a bed and chair. Nurses’ stations are in the corridors.

Oxygen is being pumped into the field hospital, and engineers in McCormick Place have calibrated the heat and air-conditioning system to provide “negative pressure” that keeps contaminants from escaping, Semonite said.

“I’ve got to admit the staff in some of these big facilities is amazing,” he said. “I met with the leadership of McCormick yesterday. They’re doing a lot of the work.”

Semonite said Walsh Construction is among contractors across the country who’ve been asking to help the Army Corps.

“This is not about trying to make a buck on a contract,” he said. “This is about taking care of the local citizens of this city, of this state, because these are all our people.

“President Trump said a couple of weeks ago, ‘This is when America really needs to rally to be able to come together.’ ”

Semonite said one of his biggest aims is to make it as easy as possible for cities and states to build such field hospitals quickly.

Semonite said the Army Corps’ response to the pandemic in some respects is more difficult than the other big challenges he’s been associated with in his more than 40-year military career, such as rebuilding communities after hurricanes swept through.

“When Mother Nature strikes, and even to a degree in combat operations, you have a pretty good understanding of what the set you’re going to inherit is when a hurricane comes,” he said. “It’s terrifying for 12 to 14 or 24 hours. But the next morning when you wake up, you kind of know what has to be built.

“And we kind of have defined the problem, and then we all attack. We don’t know where this one’s going to end. How long is this going to go? How long do facilities like this have to be run?

“This is an extremely complicated challenge,” he said. “And we are not going to be able to solve this with a complicated solution.”

At a news conference Thursday, Pritzker said he has toured the hospital being built at McCormick Place: “I didn’t know you could build something like that in five days.”

“You should all feel very, very proud of the work that’s been done so quickly,” Pritzker said, calling the carpenters, National Guardsmen and other workers at McCormick Place “patriotic.”

“They know they are doing something that’s going to save people’s lives.”

It’s been a long wait, during the peak of walleye fishing on Lake Erie, but the Ohio Department of Natural Resources announced sales of nonresident licenses will resume on Friday, May 8.

That leads this update on Chicago outdoors and the coronavirus.

Here is the update on the Ohio DNR website:

COVID-19 Update Due to the national health crisis, the Division of Wildlife Call Center will be working remotely and available to answer your questions by email between the hours of 8 a.m.-5 p.m., Monday-Friday. Please email your inquiry to wildinfo@dnr.ohio.gov. From the hours of 5 p.m. until 10 p.m., the licensing help desk may be reached by calling 1-800-WILDLIFE.

The key paragraphs are these:

I directed my staff to seek further guidance from state officials and DCEO on enforcement provisions of this, and whether or not it applies to families who reside together. All of the responses we’ve received from our inquiries indicate local law-enforcement has full discretion on enforcement of the boating provision. Therefore, we are exercising this discretion and I’ve instructed my staff not to issue citations to families who are utilizing our Lake County waterways. It is my hope people will not take advantage of this by inviting friends and non-family-members on their boat. This is not the time to take to the waterways to party. It is important for everyone to remember, abuses of our discretion or violating the temporary regulations issued by the Fox Waterway Agency could result in the Chain O’Lakes being closed. I can’t emphasize this enough – please be responsible, use good judgement, and follow all maritime laws when enjoying our waterways.

I hate to have to emphasis this, but the second paragraph matters as much as the first.

FYI, as of noon Thursday, both the lower and upper Fox River remained closed, while the Chain O’Lakes remained at no-wake. Click here to check status changes posted by the Fox Waterway Agency.

Academician Yevgeny Mikrin, general designer of Russian Space Corporation Energia, who was earlier diagnosed with coronavirus, died in Moscow. The scientist died at Kommunarka hospital near Moscow, which specializes on the treatment of Covid-positive patients.

""He was 64 years old. He was a very bright person who devoted his whole life to the development of the domestic space program.

This week, many countries in Europe have started lifting the restrictions that had been introduced in connection with the spread of the coronavirus infection. It does not mean that the pandemic has been defeated: a new “hot spot” is beginning to emerge more and more clearly on the continent. Unfortunately, it goes about Russia.

177 160 confirmed cases of COVID-2019 infection

Of these, 11,231 were detected in the last 24 hours.

More than half of those infected are still in Moscow.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin says:

""The fact that we have identified so many infected people is a huge plus, but not a minus, because it means that infected people are quarantined in a timely manner, and the spread of the virus is slowing down.""

Another “plus” in comparison with other countries is the relatively low mortality rate among coronavirus patients:

1,625 people have died in the country during the epidemic (as of May 8, 2020)

According to the authorities, the outbreak of the epidemic in Russia started later than in many other countries, and Russia had time to get prepared for the challenge.

On May 7, Russia was ranked fifth in the world in the number of COVID-19 cases. Nevertheless, the Russian authorities decided to gradually lift quarantine restrictions. For example, courts will resume their work from May 12. Industrial and construction companies will start operating in Moscow too. However, the quarantine restrictions will not touch upon citizens and small businesses. On the contrary, the measures will be toughened, and the Russians will have to pay for those restrictions from their own pockets.

From May 12, Moscow is introducing the mask regime in the city. One will be required to wear a face mask or a respirator to be able to use the metro or public transport. In addition, one will have to wear gloves. To comply with these requirements, every Muscovite will have to spend at least 2,000 rubles a month.",0
1291,1294,1726,The Army is planning a mass recruiting drive this summer,"The general helming Army Recruiting Command is preparing a massive virtual hiring event this summer after the Army’s 245th birthday on June 14. Like the other military branches, the ground service is fighting the anticipated dent to manpower after the coronavirus shuttered recruiting stations across the country this spring.

The push will involve “every person” and “every aspect”of the service that Army recruiting commander Maj. Gen. Frank M. Muth can muster, he said during a telephone call on Wednesday.

An intensive event between June 30 and July 2 will tap senior leaders to visit with city councils, nonprofits, educators and other pillars of local communities — a supercharged version of the program that the Army Chief of Public Affairs already runs, which brings Army generals back to their hometowns to engage with civilians able to influence young people.

“We would do the same thing, but it would end up being on Zoom or [Microsoft] Teams,” said Muth. “The secretary is from Chicago, maybe he engages with the Chicago leadership, and the 101st commander goes down to Nashville because he’s right there. And the 82nd commander goes and he Zooms with Raleigh. There’s all these different ways we can use these folks.""

Muth pitched the idea two weeks ago to the Army’s service secretary and chief of staff, calling it Army National Hiring Days. It will be limited in certain areas based on where shelter-in-place orders are still in effect. But Muth intends for it to be a never-before-seen recruiting drive regardless.

“Every person in the Army is involved. Every asset is involved. Everyone is on message,"" Muth added. ""We are engaging in the ‘Focus 22’ and we’re driving our message for people to either go into the recruiting stations or go to GoArmy.com.”

Army retention rises as economy slumps, but recruiting hasn’t seen a boom yet The general in charge of Army recruiting said the economic downturn doesn't appear to have impacted enlistments — yet.

Focus 22 is in reference to the 22 American cities, like Chicago, Seattle and Los Angeles, with large populations of Generation Z youths who Army leaders say have had minimal exposure to the service as a potential path in life.

Army recruiters were doing fairly well late last year and early this spring in sourcing candidates for service. By March, they had signed up 2,200 more recruits than they had by the same time last year. But the pandemic dampened their efforts as brick-and-mortar stations shuttered and the recruiting enterprise was forced to move completely online.

Right now, the service is about 4,000 contracts short of where it wants be.

“It’s more than we were last year, but at the same time, historically, we’ve had a year where we were behind that much too,” said Muth, adding that had his recruiters “not been in a position to virtually recruit,” they would have done “about zero” new contracts over the past few months.

The looming economic downturn could also help boost recruitment numbers later this summer. Unemployment has hit record levels in recent months, but economists say there’s still uncertainties about how long the slump will last. Bad economies are typically good for military recruiting and retention.

Perhaps an early indicator that confidence in the civilian job market is dropping is the fact that Army retention is roughly 15 percent higher than expected, thanks in part to short-term reenlistment contracts, according to E. Casey Wardynski, the Army’s assistant secretary for manpower and reserve affairs. Wardynski said this week that he still expects the service to meet its targeted end-strength number of 485,000 soldiers.

The Army National Hiring Days event could also “give a good indication” of how the economy will impact recruiting later in the year, according to Muth.

“I don’t know if we’ve seen the upturn yet of what we’d normally get"" during times of high unemployment, said Muth. ""What I would tell you is, I think we’ll ... have an indication by mid-July, beginning of August if things really start to change.”

Muth’s intent is to get as many general officers and command sergeants major as he can to participate. As part of an opening salvo on June 14, he’s also looking to potentially use the Army Golden Knights parachute team and the Fife and Drum Corps, as well as the Army’s legacy divisions.

“That’s kicking off on June 14, but between now and then is our shaping operation. We’re now starting to message out; we’re starting to dominate the digital space,"" Muth said.

Recent Army advertising campaigns have tried to emphasize a different side of the service, with less focus on combat roles. A commercial released last month, and another this month, focus on the Army’s role staffing hospitals and building ad-hoc medical facilities during the coronavirus pandemic.

“Everyone sees us as all armor and infantry and artillery and aviation, which is true, but that’s only 15-20 percent of the Army. A larger portion is the tech, and the help, and the engineers and the logistics,"" Muth added. ""People didn’t realize that.”",0

The biggest concern remains person-to-person contact. Contactless delivery, in which the order is left outside the recipient’s door, reduces that risk.

895,895,1069,"Mitch McConnell admits he was ""wrong"" to claim Obama didn't leave behind a pandemic plan","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged Thursday that he was ""wrong"" to claim former President Barack Obama didn't leave behind a plan for tackling a pandemic. The Obama administration had in fact prepared a 69-page playbook for pandemic response — which the Trump administration appeared to not follow.

""I was wrong,"" McConnell said in an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier. ""They did leave behind a plan. So, I clearly made a mistake in that regard.""

McConnell also said he didn't know whether the Trump administration was following the guidance prepared by the president's predecessor.

""As to whether or not the plan was followed and who is the critic and all the rest, I don't have any observation about that because I don't know enough about the details of that, Bret, to comment on it in any detail,"" the Kentucky Republican said.

At a virtual campaign event for Mr. Trump on Monday, McConnell blamed the Obama administration for not taking steps to be ready for a potential pandemic.

""We want to be early, ready for the next one, because clearly the Obama administration did not leave to this administration any kind of game plan for something like this,"" McConnell told Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law. ""

McConnell also said it was ""classless"" for Obama to criticize Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis, and said the former president ""should have kept his mouth shut."" Mr. Obama said in a private call to supporters last week that the Trump administration's response has been ""an absolute chaotic disaster.""

""You had your shot. You were there for eight years,"" McConnell said. ""I think the tradition that the Bushes set up — of not critiquing the president who comes after you — is a good tradition.""

The Obama administration did in fact pass along a comprehensive pandemic plan, including a 69-page playbook for an early response to infectious diseases. Politico reported on the playbook in March and noted that the Trump administration lagged or did not follow through on many of its steps.

I've had people tweet at me in the past 24 hours: Did the pandemic playbook really exist?

The playbook included recommendations for a ""unified message"" from a ""single federal spokesperson,"" and for invoking the Defense Production Act, which Mr. Trump hesitated to use in the early weeks of the pandemic.

Mr. Trump also disbanded the National Security Council's pandemic response unit and sought funding cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before the coronavirus landed in the United States.

Mr. Trump has consistently blamed Mr. Obama for difficulties during the pandemic response, alleging that the previous administration didn't leave a sufficient stockpile or a plan for a pandemic on the scale of the coronavirus.",1
765,765,934,The coronavirus crisis in Iran has opened up an internal fight between the government and its Revolutionary Guard,"The Iranian state is split into two factions: The elected government of President Hassan Rouhani and the Revolutionary Guard of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

The Revolutionary Guard has pushed for the under-reporting of coronavirus cases in the country, and a relaxation of the lockdown.

That triggered a resurgence of infections in April, sources tell Insider.

The Revolutionary Guard has also recently bungled a missile test that killed 19 sailors and accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet.

The Rouhani government thus sees an opening to take more control of the situation.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Iran's elected government under President Hassan Rouhani is embroiled in an internal power struggle against hardline factions of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for control of the country's response to the COVID-19 crisis.

The struggle has been exacerbated by two military disasters this year: January's accidental shootdown of a Ukrainian jetliner over Tehran, which killed 176 people; and last Sunday's failed naval missile test that accidentally killed at least 19 Iranian sailors and left more than a dozen still missing.

Iran was the second nation after China to suffer a major outbreak of COVID-19. The disease ripped through top officials and health care workers in the holy city of Qom before spreading to the rest of the nation. But despite social media posts publicising the widespread deaths and a collapsed healthcare system dating back to February, official reports have put Iran's total infection counts at just 114,533 cases as of May 14, with 6,854 dead.

Insider's sources say those numbers greatly downplay the extent of Iran's COVID problem.

'Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard have been downplaying the extent of the COVID problem since the initial outbreak hit their guys hard in Qom'

""[The Supreme Leader Ali] Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard have been downplaying the extent of the COVID problem since the initial outbreak hit their guys hard in Qom at the start of the outbreak,"" said a regional intelligence official in the Middle East who does not have permission to speak about a top military rival.

""Rouhani's government has tried to take control of the situation and use the extensive health ministry networks that it controls to reduce the outbreak. But our intelligence indicated that reports about a struggle between the elected officials and the unelected structures controlled by Khamenei.""

Before the crisis, Iran was already under economic pressure from harsh sanctions enforced by the United States intended to deter its development of nuclear weapons. The partial nationwide shutdown combined to prevent the spread of coronavirus exacerbated the situation. Our source says that national security officials linked to Khamenei reportedly forced the government to ease restrictions — and that generated an uptick in infections across the country in April. The news was suppressed in international reporting.

'The numbers the Iranians have put out since late April are considered extremely suspect'

""Any of the numbers the Iranians have put out since late April are considered extremely suspect because we have indications that the Revolutionary Guard — which means this comes from Khamenei's office directly — are not reporting cases from its health and military infrastructure and possibly intimidating reporting from other areas as well because the leadership has decided this is a national security issue, where too many cases will make Iran look inept and weak in the face of American pressure,"" one source told Insider.

The Iranian economy, which had been battered by sanctions, is expected to collapse further during the COVID epidemic. The last two years has seen Iran's currency lose more than 60% of its value and a rise 37% in consumer prices this year alone. At the same time, historically low oil prices in 2020 have reduced Iranian revenue.

An oil industry analyst based in the UAE — who asked not to be identified discussing matters that affect clients' oil revenues — said that Iran's elected government is hurt worse by the collapse of the oil prices than the Revolutionary Guard. The Revolutionary Guard maintains its own parallel government and economy in Iran. The government, by contrast, relies on traditional taxation and revenue budgeting processes, which are dependent on the health of the oil market. The Revolutionary Guard, said the source, has far more flexibility to raise and spend money through non-traditional means.

""The Guard has always maintained its own cash flow from oil skimmed off the national production, through sweetheart contracts, and company ownership deals, and through off-the-books trade both in and out of Iran. And that's before the direct support it gets from religious institutions and charities directly controlled by the supreme leader,"" said the source. ""Rouhani is forced to try to wrest political control over the Iranian system from a system designed to operate outside of that system. It's not easy.""

A 2013 investigation by Reuters estimated that Khamenei controlled assets in the tens of billions of dollars from a complex web of religious institutions, corporate investment and asset seizures. The result is that the Revolutionary Guard is a quasi-independent military and economic center of power of its own.

""He's got the type of money on hand to compete with a nation-state - the only other person with personal access to this much cash is probably Putin,"" said a financial intelligence analyst with a NATO member's intelligence service. ""Khamenei funds an independent parallel state that directly competes with Rouhani.""

The Guard's ineptitude has provided an opening for the government

The elected government — which controls ministries and the official armed forces and intelligence services of the Iranian state — has a financial and security disadvantage, by comparison.

But multiple sources said January's inept shootdown of the Ukrainian jet, plus last week's botched naval missile test that struck a naval vessel instead of the target it was towing, has given Rouhani some leverage to pressure the government response to COVID.

""They have refused to say if the missile test last Sunday was the IRGC or the proper Iranian Navy, but it's assumed that a high-profile test of a high tech weapon system in plain view of all their enemies in the Gulf would have only been a Revolutionary Guard production. But the incident as well as the tragedy in January with the airliner has given Rouhani a legitimate claim that the Guard is failing at both its international responsibilities with these failures as well as poorly responding to COVID,"" said the regional intelligence source.",1
88,88,133,Scientists Identify 69 Drugs to Test Against the Coronavirus,"
Nearly 70 drugs and experimental compounds may be effective in treating the coronavirus, a team of researchers reported on Sunday night.
Some of the medications are already used to treat other diseases, and repurposing them to treat Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, may be faster than trying to invent a new antiviral from scratch, the scientists said.
The list of drug candidates appeared in a study published on the web site bioRxiv. The researchers have submitted the paper to a journal for publication.
To come up with the list, hundreds of researchers embarked on an unusual study of the genes of the coronavirus, also called SARS-CoV-2.
To infect a lung cell, the coronavirus must insert its genes, co-opting the cell’s own genetic machinery. The cell begins to produce viral proteins, which are used to produce millions of new viruses.
Each of those viral proteins must be able to latch onto the necessary human proteins for the process to work.
In the new study, the scientists investigated 26 of the coronavirus’s 29 genes, which direct production of the viral proteins. The researchers found 332 human proteins targeted by the coronavirus.
Some viral proteins seemed to target just one human protein; other viral proteins are capable of targeting a dozen human cellular proteins.
The researchers sought drugs that also latch onto the human proteins that the coronavirus seems to need to enter and replicate in human cells. The team eventually identified 24 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat such seemingly unrelated diseases as cancer, Parkinson’s disease and hypertension.
On the list were such unexpected candidates as haloperidol, used to treat schizophrenia, and metformin, taken by people with Type 2 diabetes.
The investigators also found candidates among compounds that are now in clinical trials or that are the subject of early research. Intriguingly, some of the possible treatments are drugs used to attack parasites.
And the list includes antibiotics that kill bacteria by gumming up the cellular machinery they use to build proteins. But some of those drugs also attach to human proteins. The new study raises the possibility that this side effect might turn out to be an antiviral treatment.
One drug on the list, chloroquine, kills the single-celled parasite that causes malaria. Scientists have long known that it can also attach to a human cellular protein called the sigma-1 receptor. And that receptor is also the target of the virus.
Chloroquine has been much in the news this past week, thanks to speculation about its use against the coronavirus — some of which was repeated by President Trump at a news briefing at the White House on Friday.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, followed the president’s remarks with a warning that there was only “anecdotal evidence” that chloroquine might work.
Only well-run trials could establish whether chloroquine was safe and effective against the coronavirus, Dr. Fauci said.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced it would begin a trial on chloroquine, among other drugs.
And on Sunday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced that the state had obtained large amount of chloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin to start its own drug trial.
Nevan Krogan, a biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the new study, warned that chloroquine might have many toxic side effects, because the drug appears to target many human cellular proteins.
“You need to be careful,” he said. “We need more data at every level.”Dr. Krogan’s collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and the Pasteur Institute in Paris have started testing 22 of the other compounds on the list against live coronavirus grown in their laboratories.
On Sunday night, they were still awaiting the first results.",1

1242,1243,1612,"Many New Yorkers who suspected they had COVID-19 did not, study finds","“I think I had it.” You’ve likely heard someone say it, or perhaps you’ve been muttering it yourself.

It seems these months of quarantine-life and a growing list of COVID-19 symptoms are leading many to think back to that stubborn cold from back in February or that sudden stomach bug that hit in March and wonder if it really was the coronavirus.

Call it “I-think-I-had-it-itis.""

But a hospital study in New York City has found that out of hundreds of New Yorkers who thought they potentially had COVID-19 in the last three months but never received a confirmed clinical diagnosis, only 37% tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, a sign the body was previously likely infected and fought the virus.

“That does imply that likely many of the people who suspect that they had this probably didn't have it,” said Dr. Ania Wajnberg, one of the authors of the Mount Sinai study and an associate professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine. “You can't assume that you had it just because you didn't feel well a few months ago.”

In comparison, 99% of New Yorkers tested by Mount Sinai who had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis did have antibodies, the cornerstone of the body’s immune response to a virus, the researchers reported.

Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor, said he, too, had a bit of ""I-think-I-had-it-itis.""

""As someone who actually was convinced that they had been infected and then tested negative, it’s clear that many of us have been in the same boat,"" he said. ""What we need to remember is that COVID-19 was circulating at the same time as a number of respiratory viruses likely creating confusion on the origin of infection.""

Brownstein said the new data suggests that the U.S. could be ""a ways off [from] herd immunity and further demonstrates the need of testing capacity.""

The findings were among the first to come out of Mount Sinai’s monumental antibody testing program, which is now performing over 3,000 tests a day, tallying over 25,000 people so far. The study, which was published earlier this month and has not been peer-reviewed, looked at the initial 1,343 people tested in the program, including those who had previously confirmed coronavirus infections and those who suspected, or were told by their doctors, that they likely did but were not tested.

The broader aim of the antibody program is to identify donors for convalescent plasma, an experimental treatment sometimes used for seriously ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

“We've given convalescent plasma to hundreds of patients at the Mount Sinai health system, and that's been a good thing to be part of,” Wajnberg said. “And it's also helping us learn about potential immunity.”

MORE: What can a COVID-19 antibody test tell us?

Researchers at Mount Sinai were among the first in the U.S. to develop an antibody test and received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration in April. There are currently 13 such tests with EUA in the U.S.

This week, Mount Sinai announced it is beginning to commercially produce its antibody test with a goal of testing more than 10 million patients per month by July.

Antibody tests are distinct from what are called diagnostic coronavirus tests, which look for live virus currently infecting the body. The Mount Sinai study said the results suggest ""the optimal time frame for widespread antibody testing is at least three to four weeks after symptom onset and at least two weeks after symptom resolution.""

MORE: Antibody research indicates coronavirus may be far more widespread than known

Antibody tests not only allow doctors to understand who has antibodies, but can also help reveal how strongly a person responded to the virus. And, depending on the kind of antibody found, these tests can signal whether or not a person may have some immune protection to future infection.",1
1076,1076,1281,"A century after Prohibition, will the coronavirus finally end it? We'll drink to that.","C. Jarrett Dieterle and Teri Quimby

Opinion contributors

In the spring of 1920, spirits in America ran surprisingly high. Despite being in the midst of a temporary economic contraction, the forces that brought about our nation’s infamous booze ban — a blend of progressive elites, religious groups and anti-immigrant advocates — were ecstatic.

In addition to celebrating their political victory in the 18th Amendment, they were already applauding Prohibition for curing many of society’s worst ills. News coverage was often gushing. In January 1921, The Times-Picayune inNew Orleans felt confident enough to (dubiously) assert that Prohibition had created “more money for the poor, more money for the businessman, more money for the workman, more money in the banks.""

But the longer Prohibition wore on, the worse its impact became. Similar to other alcohol-banning experiments throughout human history, the higher the government raised the barriers to obtaining legal alcohol, the riskier the steps people took to get hooch. Black markets ran wild, followed by highly organized — and violent — criminal syndicates that turned booze smuggling into a lucrative business. Americans grew weary of the never-ending enforcement raids and expensive prosecutions.

Spirit of Prohibition is still with us

In 1933, barely a decade after it took effect, Prohibition was relegated to the dust bin of history. Well, at least that’s the popular version of the story. In reality, the 21st Amendment, which officially ushered in Prohibition’s repeal,granted state and local governments vast powers over alcohol. In the immediate aftermath of Prohibition, regulators used this newfound power to enact rules that severely limited access to booze.

Most producers were forced to sell their products through middlemen wholesalers, rather than being able to sell directly to customers. Some states took over wholesaling and retail markets for alcohol entirely. A complicated — and often expensive — licensing system arose that created substantial compliance headaches and a host of difficult to understand retailing rules.

As these laws ossified over time, protectionist forces resisted any attempts to modernize them. Licensees in one sector of the industry, such as restaurants, were often reluctant to allow other types of licensees to encroach on their territory. Powerful wholesalers continued to resist producers being granted the right to sell directly to the public.

Now, a century later, the COVID-19 crisis has triggered — virtually overnight — a mass rethinking of this sclerotic industry. Once the virus hit and government officials were forced to prioritize public health above all else, it became painfully apparent that many of our nation’s alcohol rules were not related to health or safety at all.

Many locales had long forbidden restaurants from selling to-go cocktails, but reform-minded officials started asking: Why? Finding no good answer, places like New York, Texas and Washington, D.C., promptly scrapped these restrictions and allowed carry-out drinks.

Home alone:Ancient advice for drinking at home during coronavirus self-quarantine

Likewise, breweries and distilleries have traditionally been prohibited from delivering beer and spirits in many states, but again, was there any real reason for this? Numerous states decided there was not: Kentucky passed landmark legislation allowing producers of all types of alcohol to ship products directly to in-state customers, while Virginia permanently granted distilleries the right to hand deliver spirits.

Restrictions aren't always safe

At the same time, states like Pennsylvania conveniently demonstrated how a prohibitionist mentality toward alcohol was not only unrelated to health and safety but sometimes actively antithetical to it.

When COVID hit, Pennsylvania shuttered its system of government-run Fine Wine and Good Spirits stores, which led to residents flooding across the border to liquor stores in neighboring states like Ohio, West Virginia and New Jersey. If anything, Pennsylvania’s response jeopardized public health by incentivizing residents to travel far distances rather than sheltering in place.

Crammed into bars:Wisconsin's reopening and it's a hot coronavirus mess. Don't do what we did.

To be sure, there are legitimate state interests around health, safety and welfare when it comes to alcohol. Government has important and laudable goals such as preventing the sale and service of alcohol to minors and intoxicated individuals, limiting negative consequences like drunken driving, and establishing basic rules to stop fraudulent or dangerous products from reaching the market.

At the end of the day, however, alcohol products are not substantially different from many other types of products we regulate in a more modern way. For instance, at the same time many states were restricting alcohol delivery, they were allowing home delivery of pharmaceutical products.

It’s unfortunate that it has taken an international pandemic to force America to reconsider its outdated and protectionist system of alcohol rules. But for the first time in a century, we may finally be turning the page on our prohibitionist past.

1098,1098,1324,"Despite coronavirus, low supply and high demand buoyed first-quarter home prices","Data released May 12 from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) shows that house prices increased in the first quarter of 2020 despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The NAR's quarterly report on metro home prices shows that the median single-family home price increased year over year in 96% of U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2020, versus 94% in the first quarter of 2019.

Further, home prices for the first quarter of 2020 sat at $274,600, an increase of 7.7% from the same period in 2019. Forty-six metros, particularly in Western and Southern markets, saw price jumps of double digits, including Boise City, Idaho (18.1%), Eugene, Oregon (14.5%), and Colorado Springs, Colorado (14.4%).

The NAR report shows that all regional median single-family sales prices rose when compared to 2019: Northeast (9.7%), Midwest (7.5%), South (7.5%), and West (7.5%).

NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun noted: ""The first quarter price jumps mostly reflect conditions prior to the coronavirus outbreak and show the strength of the housing demand prior to the pandemic. Even now, due to very limited listings, home prices are showing no signs of buckling.""

So why are home prices holding steady? Real estate is a lagging economic indicator, meaning a slowdown in home price growth will likely be prolonged over the next several quarters and years. And we've seen years of tight supply across most U.S. markets, which will help buoy prices.

""Supply is extremely limited, and there are simply not as many homes for sale to meet the demand among potential buyers,"" Yun said. ""More supply and more listings are needed to provide a faster recovery for the economy.""

Couple low supply with low interest rates, and demand for housing is looking as though it will remain strong in the short term, keeping prices stable. By the fourth quarter of 2019, NAR reports that there were 1.5 million homes available for sale, which was 10% less than the beginning of 2019.

966,966,1159,Obama criticizes coronavirus response — leaders 'aren't even pretending to be in charge',"US President Barack Obama meets with President-elect Donald Trump to update him on transition planning in the Oval Office at the White House on November 10, 2016

Former President Barack Obama criticized the federal government's coronavirus response in a thinly veiled swipe at the Trump administration during a virtual commencement address delivered to historically black colleges and universities on Saturday.

""More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they're doing,"" Obama said in his speech. ""A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge.""

These latest comments could ignite further tension between Obama and President Donald Trump. Obama previously criticized the Trump administration last week, when he called its Covid-19 response ""an absolute chaotic disaster"" during a private call with supporters who formerly worked for him.

Back in March, Trump blamed the country's lack of coronavirus tests on the previous administration. He has also tried to blame the Obama administration for the lack of a vaccine.

""I don't take responsibility at all,"" Trump said at a press briefing. ""Because we were given a — a set of circumstances, and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.""



One of Trump's own top health advisors, Dr. Anthony Fauci, dismissed the idea that Obama was responsible for the lack of a vaccine during a Senate hearing this week.



The White House responded to Obama's speech with a statement defending Trump's coronavirus response, claiming it had ""saved lives."" At least 88,437 Americans have died from coronavirus and more than 1.4 million have been infected, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Streamed online, Obama's speech mentioned the difficult circumstances facing graduates that stem from the pandemic, including the current economic recession. In addressing the country's 78 HBCUs, he also made reference to enduring racial inequality in the U.S., which he said can be viewed in how the pandemic is disproportionately affecting people of color as well as the recent death of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was allegedly shot by two white men in Georgia while jogging. Though Arbery died in February, the two men allegedly responsible were not arrested until May after a video that is said to depict the shooting went viral.

""We see it in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on our communities, just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog, and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn't submit to their questioning,"" Obama said during the speech. ""Injustice like this isn't new. What is new is that so much of your generation has woken up to the fact that the status quo needs fixing.""

Obama ended the speech on a note of optimism for the class of 2020, saying that the graduates were all ""role models"" now.

""Your participation in this democracy, your courage to stand up for what's right, your willingness to forge coalitions — these actions will speak volumes,"" he said.",1
730,730,890,How could the coronavirus pandemic change the world?,"The present is shaped by the past. Prior pandemics have played a critical role in molding the way humans live; and the current coronavirus pandemic will be no exception. Jon Wertheim takes a look at some of the possible changes in store on the next edition of 60 Minutes, Sunday, May 17 at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.



The way society is dealing with the pandemic today has its origins in past plagues, says Frank Snowden, a professor emeritus of history at Yale and author of ""Epidemics and Society: From the Black Death to the Present.""



""They had quarantine. They had social distancing… lockdowns,"" Snowden tells Wertheim. ""Doctors actually wore PPE. And what they had was a mask. We know about that. Theirs was differently shaped. It had a long beak. And they put sweet-smelling herbs in it to keep the foul odors away.""



The plagues led to modern ways of life, now basic to society, says Snowden. ""They introduced sewer systems, toilets… set housing regulations, paved streets. So the hygiene of modern cities that we see today was built, in large part, on the sanitary measures that grew out of the terrible experience of Asiatic cholera.""



Changes to come from this pandemic may include new health care initiatives to remedy the failure of society to be prepared for the coronavirus and its disproportionate rate of infection and death among the poor. Different places and different ages have experienced the horror of the virus in different ways. An entire generation of students sit in a kind of virtual detention, unsure when and how they will graduate or restart school.



Renowned Indian novelist Arundhati Roy, who wrote a defining account on the COVID-19 crisis, has some analogies. ""Right now it feels as though we have no present? We have a past. And we have a future. And right now we're in some sort of transit lounge,"" she says. ""We should not be trying to stitch them together without thinking about that rupture? I think the most profound thing is the rupture of the idea of touch, the idea of proximity. All these things will become so laden with risk and fear for a long, long time.""



Speaking to Wertheim from Delhi, one of the world's most polluted cities, she describes the blue skies the city's lockdown has brought, on account of fewer emissions. That is encouragement to environmentalist Bill McKibben. ""Flatten another curve. Flatten the carbon curve too… if we did that, then people might look back in 50 years at this time and thank us, instead of curse us,"" he tells Wertheim.



The dominant economic model of society is being tested by the pandemic, says McKibben. ""We've spent the last 75-- 100 years really fixated in our country and increasingly around the world, on economic growth as the reason for all being,"" McKibben says. ""And… at least for a while, that worked out pretty well. A lot of people were pulled out of poverty. But we've begun to sense the limits of that too. That's why the temperature keeps rising,"" he says.



McKibben says it would be foolish to waste this crisis. ""Well, what choice does one have, really, in a crisis but to try and make something useful of it? I mean, the dumbest thing to do would just be to set up all the pins in the bowling alley one more time exactly the same way,"" he tells Wertheim.",1
1297,1300,1732,Poll: A Quarter Of Americans Are Not Interested In Coronavirus Vaccine,"A Reuters/Ipsos poll published Thursday has revealed that a quarter of Americans are not interested in taking a coronavirus vaccine.

The poll founds that 14% were not interested at all, and 10% were not very interested in the vaccine.

However, while that 24% dismissed the idea, two thirds, 66%, said they are either “very” or “somewhat” interested in taking a vaccine when it is produced.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said “It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” adding “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.”

The Reuters report notes that health experts believe “at least 70% of Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as “herd immunity,” when enough people are resistant to an infectious disease to prevent its spread.”

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine noted that “It’s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we’ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement.”

The poll also found that 36% of respondents would be less willing to take a vaccine if President Trump said it was safe, with just 14% said they would be interested.

A week ago, Trump announced “Operation Warp Speed,” to fast-track the development and distribution of a coronavirus vaccine by January 2021, tapping experts and resources in science, medicine, the military, and the private sector.

Trump has said that the military will be deployed to distribute the vaccine, but has suggested that it will remain voluntary, noting that it will be for those “who want to get it,” and “Not everyone is going to want to get it.”

1210,1211,1560,Trump threatens to withhold aid to 2 states over expanded voting by mail,"President Trump on Wednesday threatened to halt federal funding to Michigan and Nevada over the distribution of absentee ballots in those states amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak that has left more than 90,000 Americans dead.

“Breaking: Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election,” Trump tweeted. “This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!”

Both Michigan and Nevada are considered potential swing states in the November election.

The president followed up with a tweet tagging Russ Vought, the acting director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget; Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows; and the U.S. Treasury Department.

Trump’s threat to halt funding was issued hours after floods forced the evacuation of about 10,000 people in central Michigan. He didn’t specify what kinds of federal aid he would stop, or cite a legal basis for the action.

The president is scheduled to visit a Ford ventilator-assembly plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., on Thursday.

On Tuesday, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced a plan to send applications for absentee ballots to all registered voters in the state ahead of its elections in August and November.

There have been more than 50,000 confirmed coronavirus cases reported in Michigan to date, and more than 5,000 deaths.

“By mailing applications, we have ensured that no Michigander has to choose between their health and their right to vote,” Benson said in a statement. “Voting by mail is easy, convenient, safe and secure, and every voter in Michigan has the right to do it.”

Under normal circumstances, it is up to voters to request an absentee ballot, which are restricted to those voters who are traveling or temporarily residing away from their usual residence. About a third of the states require a specific reason to vote by mail. More than half allow voters to request mail-in ballots without one.

Benson quickly responded to Trump on Twitter.

Hi! 👋🏼 I also have a name, it’s Jocelyn Benson. And we sent applications, not ballots. Just like my GOP colleagues in Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia. https://t.co/kBsu4nHvOy — Jocelyn Benson (@JocelynBenson) May 20, 2020

The president made the same threat against Nevada, again raising without evidence the specter of voter fraud.

“State of Nevada ‘thinks’ that they can send out illegal vote by mail ballots, creating a great Voter Fraud scenario for the State and the U.S.,” Trump tweeted. “They can’t! If they do, ‘I think’ I can hold up funds to the State. Sorry, but you must not cheat in elections.”

Nevada has made its June 9 state primaries an all-mail election, sending absentee ballots to registered voters. According to Reuters, the state official responsible for elections is a Republican.

There is no evidence that voting by absentee ballot leads to more voter fraud. Trump himself voted by absentee ballot in the Florida primary in March. Yet he continues to rail against the practice.

During a coronavirus briefing at the White House last month, Trump said he was opposed to mail-in ballots because “people cheat.”

“No, mail ballots, they cheat,” he said. “OK, people cheat. Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country because they are cheaters.”

At a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was asked about Trump’s tweeted threat against the state’s contingency plans.

“For 10 weeks we have been in the midst of battling COVID-19,” Whitmer said. “The people of this great state have done their part and we have seen our numbers flatten. We're not out of the woods yet. But it's taken a lot of sacrifice and it has not been easy.

“On top of this 100-year event, we have a 500-year event in a flood that has absolutely devastated a lot of families, a lot of communities,” she continued. “To see Twitter this morning, to see rhetoric like that is disheartening because I think it first shows you that there maybe was a lack of understanding of what the secretary of state was doing. She said we're going to mail applications, not ballots.”",1
702,702,858,"Nick Cordero's wife says he has woken up from coma weeks after coronavirus hospitalization: ""He's a true superhero""","Broadway star Nick Cordero has been hospitalized for more than a month battling the coronavirus. But weeks after being placed in a medically induced coma, Cordero's wife, Amanda Kloots, announced Tuesday on Instagram that the Tony-award winning actor has finally woken up.

Holding her and Cordero's 10-month-old son Elvis, Kloots announced the progress on her Instagram story, saying, ""He is awake. ... We did it."" She added that he is still very weak from the medical issues he has faced, but that he is responsive and is following commands.

""Even closing his eyes, takes it out of him. They're waiting for him to regain strength, of course, time and recovery will help with that and then eventually PT will help him get stronger,"" she said. ""But he's a true superhero.""

She added that ""everything is looking good,"" but he still has a long road ahead of him to completely recover. He had first started showing signs of waking up on Mother's Day, she said.

""It's a very long road still… but we are in the beginning of recovery and him waking up,"" she posted. ""...What a miracle.""

Cordero was initially hospitalized March 30 after being diagnosed with pneumonia. He later tested positive for coronavirus, and was intubated April 1.

In addition to dealing with pneumonia, he also went into septic shock, had two ""mini strokes,"" had a temporary pacemaker placed, and suffered from blood clotting complications which resulted in his right leg being amputated, according to Kloots.

She told ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Gayle King that the ordeal was ""terrifying,"" but that she has tried to remain positive throughout Cordero's healing process.

""I feel like there is an army of people behind him, behind us,"" she told King in April. ""… And I just believe — I get chills saying it — I just believe that he will wake up.""

Kloots has posted regularly about Cordero's condition since he was admitted to the hospital. One of her Instagram updates had a warning for those who doubt the coronavirus' potential impact on young adults, saying, ""This disease does not only effect old people. This is real. A perfectly healthy 41 year old man! ... STAY HOME! FOLLOW GUIDELINES!""

A GoFundMe page was set up to help with the medical expenses, raising $515,770 as of May 12. Kloots posted on the donation page May 7, saying that because of the funds raised, they will be able to get Cordero a prosthetic leg.",1

288,288,368,Fire left back Jonathan Bornstein staying positive during paused season,"Most Fire players are in their 20s and have many years left in their careers. Many of them haven’t even hit the high point of their time in the game and are still on the ascent.

At 35, left back Jonathan Bornstein still has plenty left to give on the field, but his timeline is different than his colleagues’ and the end is closer than the beginning. And as COVID-19 eats away at the season, it’s taking away from the moments he has left in competitive soccer.

“I’ve thought about that, actually, quite a bit,” Bornstein said. “Obviously, the closer you get to the end of your career, you almost cherish every game, every practice a little bit more. Not being able to train with the team due to extenuating circumstances is a bit of a Debbie Downer kind of a thing, but at the same time I’m very thankful that my family and I are healthy and we’re here with the support of the team.”

That isn’t to say the end of Bornstein’s career is imminent. He certainly doesn’t think so, and the way his time in Chicago has started indicates he can still play at a high level.

After joining the Fire last summer, Bornstein solidified a spot that had given the team trouble and helped the back line finally mesh. Bornstein’s strong form carried over to the first two games of 2020, and he even scored in the Fire’s 1-1 draw March 7 at New England to help secure the team’s first point of the year.

As it turned out, that would be their last appearance for a long time. The pandemic halted the sports world the next week, and it’s unclear when and how the season will resume and when Bornstein will be reunited with his teammates.

Bornstein already is looking forward to that moment, whenever it arrives. But it won’t be the start of a farewell.

“Once we get started again, I’ll be even that much more anxious to be on the field and to be making the most of my time that I have left,” Bornstein said. “I try not to think too much about it because, to be honest, my goal is to play until I’m 40, so I’ve got another five years, if it all goes to plan. I try not to let the situation get me down as much as I can.”

The thing is, nobody knows when soccer will return. Bornstein is hoping it comes back sooner than later. He’d rather play in the summer than the end of 2020. But he doesn’t have control over the timeline.

He’s just trying to stay mentally and physically prepared for whatever comes his way.

“I think the uncertainty in any aspect of life is always what’s scary,” Bornstein said. “Doubt casts a shadow upon what could be, what couldn’t be, and at this point, we’re almost all living in the shadow of doubt. It’s a bit of an unsettling thought, but you’ve got to have faith that eventually we’re going to get through all of this and we’ll be able to get back to some sort of normality.”",1
1053,1053,1249,Coronavirus child care crisis tops concerns as nation pushes to reopen. Parents ask: Who will watch our children?,"Carlos Atkins, 27, used to spend weekdays with his 2-year-old son Malachi, taking walks and reading books, before heading out into the night to power wash sidewalks, pick up trash and remove graffiti in downtown Detroit for a local nonprofit. Then the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the city and his son’s day care center but not Atkins’ job as an essential worker. After being reassigned to a midday shift that ends at 9 pm, he’s scrambled to find child care, leaning heavily on his mom and aunt.

Even clad in a jumpsuit, gloves and mask, his line of work carries health risks and he’s fearful of bringing home the deadly virus to the two-family flat he shares with his son, mother and younger sister. And, fiercely protective of his young charge, he wonders whether his son should return to day care when Michigan reopens.

“It’s overwhelming. I try not to focus on it,” Atkins says. “I just hope and pray for the best.”

What schools will look like when they reopen:Scheduled days home, more online learning, lots of hand-washing

When will schools reopen?:Not soon, education leaders say, despite Trump's declarations

The push to reboot the nation’s economy is leaving millions of parents like Atkins in a tough bind. They can’t go back to work without someone to care for their children, whether preschools or day care facilities, babysitters or relatives. And, even if they can find child care, they’re worried states are moving too quickly and may be putting their kids’ lives at risk.

Last week the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected an extension of the state’s stay-at-home order. In some places, employees are being called back to work before child care facilities open.

Lack of child care is quickly emerging as one of the biggest barriers to the economy bouncing back, says Patricia Cole, senior director of federal policy for Zero to Three, a nonprofit focused on early childhood development.

“Child care is foundational to our nation’s ability to recover from this crisis,” Cole said during a news briefing put on by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

COVID-19 plunges child care system into crisis

COVID-19 has plunged the child care industry, 90% of which is privately run, into a crisis the likes of which the nation has never seen.

Already child care centers were expensive to operate and stayed afloat on meager profits. Caregivers and other staffers, a third of whom have been laid off, often get by on poverty wages and public assistance, unable to afford child care for their own children.

Now child care advocates argue the nation’s already fragile system is at risk of collapse. They are lobbying for billions more in federal aid to ensure reliable child care is available to parents.

Though in many places they were not required to close, since the pandemic began, nearly half of child care facilities nationwide have shut down, some of them indefinitely as the coronavirus forced families to keep kids at home, according to a survey of child care providers conducted by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).

Seventeen percent of providers have closed to everyone except the children of essential personnel. Of the facilities which have remained open, 85% are operating at less than 50% of enrollment capacity and the majority of those are operating at less than 25% of capacity, the survey conducted in April found.

“We don't fully know yet who are the child care providers and facilities that are not going to have survived this economic crisis because they just couldn't keep the doors open,” says Javaid Siddiqi, CEO of The Hunt Institute, an education nonprofit in Cary, North Carolina.

It’s also unclear how many providers will be able to afford to reopen or at what capacity with strict new health protocols that vary from state to state. Some new rules limit the number of children that can be in any group – and in many cases require the same children and adults be placed together every day. Child care centers also face higher costs for additional staffing, personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies.

Summer camps and programs have also fallen on hard times and are being driven out of business. The ones still standing are trying to figure out if or how they can reopen safely.

Half of facilities closed, remaining providers stretched

Child care providers that have remained open to watch over the children of essential workers are stretched to the breaking point.

Crystal Perry-Grant, a 38-year-old mother of three, runs a family day care in Perris, California, a small city in Riverside County. For 12-hour stretches with the help of her 17-year-old daughter, she cares for eight children whose parents are essential workers from firefighters to UPS workers, ranging in age from 1 to 9.

School-age kids learn remotely on six computers that routinely slow her Wi-Fi to a crawl. She cooks homemade soups from fresh farm produce to boost their immune systems. Hand sanitizer squirted liberally throughout the day into little palms has kept sickness at bay. In the past two months, she hasn’t had even a single runny nose.

“Our parents need us. They don’t have family around. It’s a dire need. I would feel bad if I closed,” Perry-Grant says. “No one had a job they could up and quit, so I couldn’t either.”

But Perry-Grant can’t take on any more children. She has no openings and a long waiting list.

“This goes very much to the heart of whether we are going to be able to just reopen the economy,” says Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress who studies the child care industry. “There are a lot of reasons why we can't just flip a switch and this is very high on the list.”

For Demetriss “Demi” DeShazior, a 41-year-old medical assistant in Miami, child care tops her list of concerns.

Her mother babysat her 2-year-old while DeShazior languished on a long waiting list for partially subsidized child care. When she was seven months pregnant, DeShazior learned she’d secured a spot, but this was a month before the pandemic hit. Before she could finish filling out the paperwork, child care facilities closed.

So DeShazior took family medical leave earlier than she planned in March to stay home with her son. Now she's applying for child care for her toddler and 5-week-old as an essential health worker but her unease is growing.

“If I do return to work, will my babies be safe from contracting COVID-19 at day care?"" DeShazior wonders. “Will I even have day care covered for both babies by my return date?”

Nation cannot reopen with kids still at home

Even before the coronavirus tore across the country, parents scrambled to find child care. With too few spots to meet demand, the burden fell heaviest on low-wage parents, women and families of color. Now millions more spots may have evaporated.

Traditional backstops such as grandparents who used to step in to care for children while parents worked belong to populations most vulnerable to the coronavirus.

“Most states are talking about child care, but there’s a mixed bag in terms of how many are actually being planful about it. When you as a state say, ‘we’re open,’ but then you don’t give guidance around child care, that puts the burden of the situation on families,” says NAEYC's CEO Rhian Evans Allvin. And that, Allvin, says, “exacerbates the already existing inequities in early childhood education because inherently wealthier families have more options.”

As more parents prepare to return to work, the enormousness of the challenge facing the nation’s patchwork child care system is staggering.

Four in 10 working adults have children under 18. Nearly 60% of children under 5 participated in regular weekly care arrangements and a third were enrolled in a child care program of some kind before the coronavirus struck. Yet, with many child care providers from small family day cares to after-school programs closing up shop indefinitely, parents are at loose ends.

“Parents who are being called back into work at this point really may find challenges in securing care or even, in some cases, securing the care they were accustomed to,” says Dan Wuori, director of early learning at The Hunt Institute, which has a database tracking state child care policies.

Among those parents is Laura Byrd, 35, a human resources generalist from Newark, New Jersey and mother of a 7-year-old who’s been working from home since the start of the pandemic.

“Our ‘new normal’ will pose some difficulties once I am instructed to return to the office. As the state reopens, our day care centers and summer camps will not be operating which will create child care issues for me,” says Byrd, who’s considering taking a leave of absence if necessary.

Agonizing choices between health risks and paychecks

Reopening is forcing parents in Georgia, Florida and other states into an agonizing choice between potentially risking their health and the health of their children and earning a paycheck.

Late at night and in the early morning hours, Christy Moreno, 39, a bilingual editorial director, squeezes a stress ball while sending work emails from her Kansas City, Missouri, home.

Her makeshift office is a small round table in the corner of her dining room covered in stray crayons and device chargers. This single mother of two, ages 10 and 13, balances overseeing her children’s education and counseling Latino parents working in hotels and restaurants on how to find child care. On social media, parent groups are overflowing with worry and confusion: What are families supposed to do?

Anxieties are running especially high for parents whose children have health conditions that put them at higher risk for the coronavirus. Many can’t afford lower-risk options such as babysitters and nannies or having one parent stay home. These parents say even if they can find child care, they don’t know if they should send their kids. Some employees can take sick leave or expanded family and medical leave if they are caring for a child when schools and day care centers are closed under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed into law in March, but not everyone has that option.

“Parents are being forced into this Catch-22,” says Keri Rodrigues, founding president of the National Parents Union, a network of parent organizations across the country. “They feel a desperate need to go back to work but at the same time they are terrified of this deadly virus.”

Parents worry: Is it safe to send kids back to child care?

Laid off in March, Rachel Jean-Pierre is a single mother of two in Union, New Jersey. If she’s called back to her job in New York City as a guest service manager in July, she will have to find a family member to help care for her children, ages 6 and 9, both of whom have asthma.

“With the government reopening the economy with no confirmed solution to this pandemic, I am torn between wanting my children to return to their normal schedules and wanting to keep them safe,” she says. “Until the country has really grabbed hold of this pandemic, as a parent with children who suffer from asthma, I would rather be safe than sorry.”

Conflicting messages have not helped parents make these tough calls. While President Donald Trump pushes governors to work to reopen schools, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned in Senate testimony last week, ""We don't know everything about this virus and we really better be pretty careful, particularly when it comes to children.""

It’s week 11 of quarantine for Naomi Nedd, a 49-year-old mother and contract negotiator for a managed care plan in Queens. She’s resorted to bribing her 3-year-old son with gummy bears and screen time when she has to write a contract or jump on a Zoom call. Once he falls asleep at 7:30 pm, she digs in for hours to make a dent in her workload.

“I went into this thinking, my kid is home, it will be fine. But it’s so different when you are trying to be the professional you are when you’ve left your child at day care than when you are at a dining room table with a 3-year-old who just knows you’re mommy,” Nedd says.

Her son is supposed to start a summer program in July and preschool in the fall, but her heart races just thinking about it. The ravages of the coronavirus are all around her at the epicenter of the New York outbreak. Children her son’s age don’t know how to socially distance.

“I don't care what opens up, if my gut feels like it isn’t safe, we will have to figure out a way to continue to make it work at home,” Nedd says.

In Boston, Yahaira Lopez, a 41-year-old mother of 10-year-old twins, one with ADHD, the other with autism, was recently laid off from her job on a mobile crisis team performing mental health risk assessments. She’s struggling to be a substitute teacher to her two fourth graders, run Autism Sprinter, her nonprofit that helps the families and caregivers of children who are on the spectrum, and figure out how she’ll afford rent and utilities.

Schools are closed, summer programs are up in the air and Massachusetts has not yet reopened child care centers, she says. Even when these programs restart, Lopez says she’s not sure she will send her kids. Both of her sons have severe asthma.

“I would probably be very scared to send my children to any form of child care or after school program,” she says, “or, to be honest with you, even back to school into what may be overcrowded classrooms.”",1
94,94,141,You’ve Got Mail. Will You Get the Coronavirus?,"
Scientists agree that the main means by which the SARS-CoV-2 virus jumps from an infected person to its next host is by hitching a ride in the tiny droplets that are sprayed into the air with each cough or sneeze. But with deliveries now at holiday levels as locked-down Americans shop online rather than in person, the question remains: Can you catch the coronavirus from the parcels and packages your overburdened mail carrier keeps leaving at your door?
The first formal process for curbing the spread of infection by detaining travelers from an affected region until their health was proved was instituted in what is now Dubrovnik, Croatia, in 1377, against the bubonic plague. (This temporal buffer was originally 30 days, but when that proved too short, it was extended to 40 days, or quaranta giorni, from which we derive the word “quarantine.”)
Mail disinfection soon followed, as the then Republic of Venice extended and formalized the quarantine process to include cargo. Items that were considered particularly susceptible, including textiles and letters, were also subject to fumigation: dipped in or sprinkled with vinegar, then often exposed to smoke from aromatic substances, from rosemary to, in later years, chlorine. Once the items were treated, a distinctive wax seal or cancellation was usually applied to them, so the recipient would know where and when the disinfection had been carried out. (Such marks often provide the only remaining evidence of the ebb and flow of disease; some minor outbreaks of plague or typhus in remote areas of medieval Europe, for example, would have been lost to history without their postal traces.)
The diseases changed, but for centuries mail disinfection techniques remained largely the same. As recently as 1900, during a plague outbreak in Honolulu, letters were routinely disinfected by clipping off the two opposite corners of each envelope and then spreading a batch of mail out in an airtight room filled with sulfur fumes for three hours.
A representative for the U.S. Postal Service was unwilling to discuss current sanitization protocols. But the agency’s website reports that the only mail items receiving treatment are letters and parcels sent to ZIP codes beginning in 202, 203, 204 and 205, which serve federal government agencies in Washington, D.C. In a process that began shortly after the 2001 anthrax attacks, the Postal Service sends mail destined for those ZIP codes to New Jersey, where they are put on a conveyor belt and passed under a high-energy beam of ionizing radiation that kills bacteria and viruses. The letters and packages are then “aired out” for a while, before being forwarded to their destinations. The paper is left slightly faded and somewhat crispy, but sterile.
Should mail irradiation be extended beyond these exclusive ZIP codes, to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus? On CBS News’s Face the Nation on Sunday morning, Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, warned that SARS-CoV-2 could potentially be transmitted by contaminated objects. “This is a sticky virus,” he said. The structure of the coronavirus’s protective envelope helps it bond tightly to certain surfaces: skin in particular, as well as fabric and wood, but also plastic and steel.
Some government agencies seem concerned that all of that circulating paper might be a potential vector. In early February, when COVID-19 was still just “the coronavirus” — and, for most Americans, still someone else’s problem — China’s central bank announced that it would quarantine the country’s cash, to prevent the disease from spreading from one person to another on money. The government collected bank notes from Hubei, the worst-hit province, and then sanitized the stacks of bills, either by baking them at a high temperature or bathing them in ultraviolet rays. The newly laundered cash was then kept in isolation for seven to 14 days before being rereleased into the banking system.
A few weeks later, the U.S. Federal Reserve began quarantining dollar bills repatriated from Asia, holding them for seven to 10 days before allowing them to re-enter the domestic financial system. Bank notes are made of cotton pulp, not wood fiber, but still: Why sanitize money and not mail?
Representatives of the big three package deliverers in the United States — U.P.S., FedEx and the Postal Service — insisted there is no need. “The C.D.C. has advised that there is a low risk of transmission on packages,” said Matthew O’Connor, a spokesman for U.P.S. FedEx, in a statement, said: “The guidance from the W.H.O. is that the likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low, and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, traveled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.”
David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, noted that the surgeon general, Dr. Jerome M. Adams, along with the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, has “indicated that there is currently no evidence that COVID-19 is being spread through the mail.”
This is because many scientists think it is quite unlikely that you can catch the coronavirus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and subsequently touching your own mouth or nose. (One review of scientific publications on the subject concluded that hand washing seems to cut the risk of respiratory infection by a mere 16 percent — but added that the studies examined were of poor quality and more research was urgently needed.)
The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment — Germany’s equivalent of the F.D.A. — advises that while the virus could, theoretically, be transmitted through this kind of “smear” infection, as opposed to the standard “droplet” infection, there have been no known cases in which individuals have caught the coronavirus by touching a contaminated surface and then transferring the virus to their mouth or nose. Then again, contact transmission is notoriously difficult to study and document.
A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week shed more light on the subject. A group of researchers from the National Institutes of Health, the C.D.C., Princeton University and the University of California, Los Angeles, misted virus particles into a rotating drum and studied how long the floating particles survived on various surfaces. They found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus survived for up to 24 hours on cardboard — three times longer than its cousin, the original SARS.
“In that light, you might expect the virus to remain viable for hours but probably not days on mail,” said James Lloyd-Smith, one of the study’s authors. “But there are important caveats.”
Among these: The study specifically looked at aerosolized virus particles, rather than the fine droplets that infected people emit with each cough or sneeze. The line between aerosols and droplets is fuzzy, but, broadly, droplets are bigger and settle more quickly, while aerosols are smaller and float for longer.
“Little is known about the rate at which infected people generate such aerosolized viruses,” Dr. Lloyd-Smith said, although some medical procedures — including intubation to assist with breathing — are known to create aerosols. In addition, the experiment was designed to simulate indoor air; viruses like this one are expected to be stable for longer at lower temperatures and lower humidity.
In an experiment that might better mimic the effect of sneezing on a letter, researchers from Hong Kong University pipetted droplets of SARS-CoV-2 onto various surfaces. Their results, which have not yet been peer reviewed and do not include details on temperature and humidity conditions, found no infectious virus left on paper after three hours — although, alarmingly, a significant level could be detected on the outer layer of a surgical mask after seven days.
“The bottom line is that there is some hypothetical risk of viable viruses surviving on mail,” Dr. Lloyd-Smith said. “But given the time periods involved, this seems like a pretty minimal risk to the general public.”
Ben Chapman, a food safety specialist at North Carolina State University who studies the interaction of pathogens and surfaces, agreed that although the virus can persist on packages, these have not been identified as a risk factor for transmission. Nonetheless, he said, “I’d just wash my hands after handling,” rather than spray with Lysol or wipe with bleach. “I want to preserve the good sanitizers for risky things, and hand washing works just as well as spraying.”
For the delivery workers pulling 12-hour shifts to keep up with demand, and struggling to access the sanitizing supplies and hand-washing facilities they need, the situation is potentially riskier. “I would be more worried about the mail sorters and mail carriers, who are exposed to many more pieces of mail,” Dr. Lloyd-Smith said.
Delivery is deemed an “essential function” by the Department of Homeland Security, and the volume of packages is expected only to increase as more Americans are required to shelter in place. Irradiating all mail is both overkill and likely impossible, given the volumes in question and the resources required. But making sure that the people who are keeping mail moving during this pandemic are protected also seems essential, not to mention ethical.
“The safety and well-being of U.S. Postal Service employees and customers is our highest priority,” said Mr. Partenheimer, who added that the agency is closely monitoring the situation to implement C.D.C. and public health department advice.",1
1316,1319,1793,‘Godfather of Grass’ seeks prison release over virus concern,"Lisbon, Ohio – The “Godfather of Grass,” who was sentenced for his role in a large marijuana operation after eight years on the run, has asked a judge to release him from a federal prison in Ohio that has seen nine coronavirus deaths.

John Robert “Johnny” Boone vouched for his release on the grounds that he is 76, in poor health and has served most of his 57-month prison sentence, The Courier Journal reported Thursday. Elmer George, his lawyer, added Boone has a history of illnesses and called his continued imprisonment life-threatening.

About 137 inmates and eight prison employees have tested positive for the novel coronavirus at the Federal Correctional Institution at Elkton, where Boone is serving out his prison sentence. Another 63 inmates and 44 prison employees have recovered after testing positive for the virus, the Courier Journal reported.

The U.S. Bureau of Prisons has so far released only five of the 837 Elkton inmates identified as medically vulnerable to home confinement, a move that drew rebuke from a federal judge in Cleveland this week. The American Civil Liberties Union has also sued the Bureau of Prisons over the issue.

Boone, who had called himself “Charles Grass,” fled to Canada after a 2008 indictment on federal drug charges in Kentucky and spent eight years on the loose until his capture in late 2016. He was sentenced in 2018 after pleading guilty to one count of conspiring to possess, grow and distribute more than 1,000 marijuana plants at an operation near Springfield, Kentucky.

Boone was convicted in the 1980s and spent a decade in prison for what prosecutors called a massive marijuana syndicate. They said he was head of a multistate marijuana operation known as the “Cornbread Mafia,” which had 29 farms in several states.

He was featured on the TV show “America’s Most Wanted,” spurring a Facebook page called Run, Johnny, Run.

735,735,895,"As investors ditch foreign ETFs for U.S. funds, there's a 'big contrarian call' in play, says issuer","There's a global shift going on in the world of ETFs.

Investors have been fleeing European and emerging market funds in favor of U.S.-based exchange-traded funds in recent months, with European ETFs seeing record outflows in March amid the volatility.

Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors, said that while non-U.S. stock-based ETFs lost roughly $19 billion over the last three months, ""U.S.-targeted strategies"" attracted roughly $57 billion.

""It was really driven by the outflows … out of the European-focused ETFs,"" Bartolini told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" on Monday. ""I think basically what investors are doing here is ostensibly following Warren Buffett's advice and just buying America.""

Buffett has expressed optimism over the U.S. economy's ability to withstand the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, telling Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in a recent virtual meeting that ""Nothing can basically stop America.""

The billionaire investor has long backed U.S. investments as havens in times of crisis, writing in a 2008 op-ed in The New York Times that he had ""been buying American stocks.""

""There's really no preference from investors to express a risk-on view overseas given that the economic and fundamental foundations are not as strong as they are in the U.S.,"" Bartolini said.

And though he acknowledged that ""weak performance, the constructive relative valuations of non-U.S. equity markets and low levels of positioning ... set up international to be a big contrarian call right now,"" Bartolini found one big issue with that strategy.

""Unfortunately, that was the same call for the last few years and it has yet to pan out,"" he said. ""I think if investors do want to sort of step into that market ... firms with higher-quality balance sheets that do trade at inexpensive valuations may be worth a flier just because they might have some more fundamental rigor to withstand any degradation in earnings and economic growth.

The donation is made possible through the ASJ and its subsidiary project “Time Done,” which aims to knock down legal barriers that previously incarcerated people often face such as access to housing, education and employment.

I AM HONORED TO BE REPRESENTING @safeandjust AND THE TIME DONE CAMPAIGN.@TimeDone IS ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE A SECOND CHANCE AFTER THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR SENTENCE WE NEED TO LIFT RESTRICTIONS ON JOBS AND HOUSING AND EXPUNGE OLD RECORDS SO WE STOP THE CYCLE!!! pic.twitter.com/DqC4G66L7M — G HERBO (@gherbo) April 2, 2020

As of this week, seven detainees of the jail have died after testing positive for COVID-19, according to the Cook County Sheriff’s office. In addition, 236 detainees have tested positive for the virus, with six receiving treatment at hospitals. Another 291 detainees are no longer considered positive for COVID and are being monitored at the jail’s recovery facility, the sheriff’s office said.

Two corrections officers and a court deputy at the facility died earlier this week.

“The conditions in jails and prisons are ripe for spreading coronavirus within them and into communities,” said Robert Rooks, co-founder and CEO of Alliance for Safety and Justice, in a statement. “There have been important efforts to reduce the population at Cook County Jail, yet we wanted to provide support to protect people inside of the facility while also recognizing there is more to be done. There are ways to safely reduce incarceration that are critical to prevent any further spread of COVID-19.”

G Herbo isn’t the only Chicago hip-hop luminary who’s giving back to a community in a time of need.

Earlier this week, activist and rapper Common called attention to how the pandemic poses a health risk to millions of incarcerated people in the U.S. via his criminal justice reform organization Imagine Justice in a campaign dubbed #WeMatterToo.

401,401,497,13 ways the coronavirus pandemic could forever change the way we work,"In only a few months, the coronavirus pandemic has upended the daily lives of people around the world. For Americans, the economic impact of the virus has led to new categorizations of ""essential"" workers, a large-scale move to remote work and skyrocketing unemployment that is expected to continue increasing. With more than 30 million people filing for unemployment in the past six weeks, the U.S. is predicted to experience a coronavirus-induced recession through 2021. And amid stay-at-home orders across the country, office workers have ditched their daily commutes to work from dining room tables, couches and beds in their own homes. Many may find themselves in this situation for the long haul, as businesses struggle to find a path forward while restrictions slowly lift. But what other changes will we see in the coming months and years? CNBC Make It spoke to futurists, employment experts, CEOs, designers and more to find out how the pandemic could forever transform the way we work.

Working in an office could become a status symbol

Following the pandemic, it's likely that more Americans will split their time between working from home and from a corporate office, says Brent Capron, the design director of interiors at architecture firm Perkins and Will's New York studio. ""People will still gather for work,"" he says. ""But the amount of time you work in proximity with others, and what your work week looks like — I see that to be the biggest cultural shift moving forward."" With more people working remotely, companies may open regional hubs or provide access to co-working spaces wherever their workers are concentrated rather than have the majority of their workforce at one central office. As a result, corporate headquarters may become a status symbol for the companies that still have the budget and a workforce big enough to warrant pricey real estate in a major city. A company's investment in its headquarters could become a way to recruit talent, says Jane Oates, president of WorkingNation, a nonprofit campaign about unemployment, and a former assistant secretary at the Department of Labor. Job seekers may consider it a draw to work for a company with a physical location, which could boost brand awareness and overall influence within the industry.

Most meetings could be replaced by email and IM

Expect your post-pandemic work calendar to contain fewer meetings overall, says Nadjia Yousif, managing director and partner of Boston Consulting Group's London office. The pandemic has been a technological equalizer of sorts, she says, where people previously unaccustomed to using tech tools in the workplace have had no choice but to adapt. And in some cases, workers are becoming more efficient. ""People have been more patient in learning new technologies and engaging with them, simply because they've had to,"" Yousif says. ""I think those best practices will live on. I think we're all developing new muscles to work virtually."" To that end, expect a generally more agile way of working and communicating with colleagues: More meetings will become emails, and more emails will become instant messages. For team members who no longer work together in a central office, phone calls and meetings may move to video. This could help to build trust among workers who can't interact in person, Yousif says. When you're able to pick up on nonverbal cues, or you're invited into a colleague's home via video chat, ""a different type of intimacy is formed in a faster way than would happen in a traditional working environment,"" she says.

It could be the end of business travel as we know it

As travel of all kinds is halted, telecommuting is adopted at scale and companies attempt to cut costs and balance their budgets, many experts believe business trips as we know them will be a thing of the past. ""I don't think [business travel] is ever going to be exactly the same,"" says Gary Leff, a travel industry expert and author of the blog View from the Wing. Changing consumer preferences and greater interest in social distancing will limit large group events such as conferences and conventions for the foreseeable future, says Leff, and permanently decrease the volume of business travel. Additionally, Leff expects that during this time, companies will learn that some business travel is unnecessary and can be done via video meetings. He also points out as organizations attempt to recoup their pandemic-related losses, travel budgets will be cut.

Office buildings could become 'elaborate conference centers'

With the office building recast as the ultimate status symbol, its main purpose could shift. ""Does office space strictly become elaborate conference centers?"" asks Capron. He predicts office buildings of the future may become facilities to gather, while focused work is done remotely. This could mean fewer walled-off offices and more gathering spaces to host meetings, conferences and other company-wide events. Beyond that, the open office floor plan will likely stick around. Despite criticism that they kill productivity, it's likely companies will still use the layout in an effort to lower real estate costs. Open layouts will change, however: Desks could become spaced out, partitions could go up, cleaning stations stocked with hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes will become the norm, and workers may seek out spaces for focused work, such as privacy booths. Capron stops short of saying cubicles will make a comeback. Agile workspaces with unassigned seating will decline in popularity. Workers will want the security and control of having a personal space they come to every day or every few days and can clean frequently. In shared spaces, expect more touchless fixtures, such as door sensors, automatic sinks and soap dispensers and voice-activated elevator banks. Architects may also design spaces with durable building materials, furniture, flooring and other surfaces that can stand up to frequent deep-cleaning, which is expected to be a lasting necessity of the future workplace for years to come.

Mandatory on-the-job medical screening could become the norm

Health and legal experts predict that on-the-job medical screening, such as temperature checks and antibody tests, will be a reality for those who return to work in the months ahead. And in many cases it's already happening: To combat the spread of coronavirus among essential workers, some of the biggest employers in the country, including Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot and Starbucks have begun taking the temperatures of their employees before they are allowed to work. According to labor and employment attorney David Barron, not only are employers legally permitted to check employees' temperatures, they are also currently being encouraged to do so by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""As long as employers don't discriminate — they can't pick and choose who is tested — it's absolutely legal."" It's also possible U.S. workers may be asked to show some form of ""immunity certificate,"" verifying that they have immunity to Covid-19, before they return to work, Barron says. This approach, in which workers take an antibody test to confirm that they have immunity, is being embraced in countries such as the United Kingdom, which is attempting to roll out an ""immunity passport"" program. However, some scientists have warned that it is yet to be scientifically proven that having antibodies for coronavirus gives a person immunity. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has indicated that an ""immunity certificate"" program is ""being discussed."" ""It might actually have some merit under certain circumstances,"" he told CNN.

Coworkers could become even closer

If there's one bright spot to how the pandemic will impact the future of work, it's that it could strengthen the personal relationships we form with colleagues. ""For a long time, we've probably taken for granted the ability to see our coworkers every day and maybe didn't realize how valuable that was,"" says Lakshmi Rengarajan, a workplace connection consultant formerly of WeWork and Match.com. ""I think teams will be a lot closer when they're able to move back into the workplace."" Organizational psychologist, Wharton professor and ""Originals"" author Adam Grant agrees. He predicts that, as coworkers return to the office, they'll ditch previous messaging habits and actually get up, walk around and visit with each other in person. ""There will probably be fewer sad desk lunches,"" he says. Workplace friendships could flourish among colleagues who relied on each other during the pandemic and got to know one another on a more personal level. But despite more in-person interaction among colleagues, handshakes are on their way out. Fauci recently advised that handshaking needs to stop even when the pandemic ends, and other health experts agree. Rengarajan says gestures that can convey friendliness and respect from a distance, such as a nod or smile, could become the social norm. ""Maybe it's the rise of eye contact or listening,"" Rengarajan says. Read more: The pandemic has probably made you more vulnerable with coworkers—here's why that could be a good thing

Fashion-ready face masks could become a wardrobe staple

Though business casual will likely remain the norm in offices, two new types of apparel could also spring from the pandemic: The rise of work-from-home office wear, and face masks as a socially mandated accessory. Workers who video conference frequently may retool their wardrobe to be camera-friendly — more bold colors, large-scale patterns and clean lines; fewer neutrals, small prints and frills. ""If we are going to be mediating our professional lives on screens more, I think people will think more about how they appear on screen,"" says Natalie Nudell, a fashion and textiles historian faculty member at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. Wearing a face mask around the office may become commonplace, especially in bigger companies with more workers sharing tight quarters. This could be an opportunity for the textile industry to innovate how to make masks more protective, comfortable and stylish.

Standard 9-to-5 office hours could become a thing of the past

As professionals juggle the demands of work life and home life all in the same place, many employers have relaxed rules about workers starting and ending their days at a set time. ""I think you'll see a new norm around trust and respect"" in the ways employers manage their staff moving forward, says career coach Julie Kratz. With many employees successfully working from home now, it will be a lot harder for employers to deny flexibility around work hours and work settings, she explains. ""For most office-type work, you can absolutely do your work remotely, and with technology, you can build it around your schedule,"" adds Kratz, who says that many of her clients at tech companies such as Salesforce were already working flexible hours before the Covid-19 outbreak. To maintain a sense of structure, Kratz says employers will have to set expectations for when they need everyone in the office or online for staff meetings and other team activities. Additionally, she says, in order to create a balance between work time and personal time, employees and managers will have to work closely together to ensure that no one is feeling pressured to respond to emails and messages at all hours of the day. ""By all means, it's not about throwing out all the rules,"" she emphasizes, ""but it's about letting people co-create them.""

Home office stipends could become a common perk

When Twitter and e-commerce company Shopify issued mandatory work-from-home orders for employees in March, both employers provided staff with additional resources to help smooth the transition to remote work. At Shopify, workers were given a $1,000 stipend to purchase necessary supplies for their home office spaces. Meanwhile at Twitter, all employees, including hourly workers, received reimbursement for home office equipment including desks, chairs and ergonomic cushions. If working remotely becomes the norm, then home office stipends could become a common workplace perk, says bestselling author and futurist Jacob Morgan. In order for remote work to be effective, employers will have to provide employees with the resources needed to be productive, he explains. This includes a small stipend that will allow workers to ""customize their space in a way they think is sufficient."" This remote flexibility will also allow companies to ""save money on the overhead cost of running these massive facilities,"" career coach Julie Kratz adds. On average, employers that allow employees to work from home part-time save about $11,000 per year for each employee working remotely, according to research-based consulting firm Global Workplace Analytics. Using some of this money to invest in remote office setups ""will buy loyalty from your employees because it shows you care about them, you care about the ergonomics of their situation at home and you want them to be happy and productive,"" Kratz says.

The workplace could become more equitable for women

With many workplaces now being forced to operate remotely, long-term flexibility could be here to stay, allowing more women to remain in the workforce while balancing home and work life, says Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. This change in workplace structure could have a huge impact on women, as they are more likely than men to adjust their careers for family. In fact, roughly 31% of women who took a career break after having kids said they didn't want to but had to because of a lack of employer flexibility, according to a 2019 FlexJobs survey of more than 2,000 women with children under 18. This break, according to PayScale, can easily cost women tens of thousands of dollars when lost wages, future wage growth and lost retirement and Social Security contributions are added up. A more flexible work culture could also create more equity at home as both men and women are able to spend quality time with their families. ""You're going to see more men starting to want these [flexible options] too, assuming they enjoyed the time at home with their kids,"" Kratz says. Though a wider variety of work options won't solve all of our equity issues, other countries show it is possible to create a more gender-balanced culture. ""You can see this in Scandinavian countries, for example; they offer this flexibility,"" Kratz says. ""You see gender equality is much higher in those countries as a result."" Read more: Why long-term flexible work options could be a game changer for women

Middle management positions could be cut forever

In the months and years ahead, we could continue to see a hollowing out of middle management. ""One of the big things that happened during the 2008 global financial crisis is that organizations pulled out all sorts of layers of middle management, which actually makes it harder to get promoted,"" says Brian Kropp, vice president at research firm Gartner. That's one reason wage growth was sluggish, he says, even as the economy reached new heights: Workers were not promoted to middle-management roles as frequently, since so many were eliminated during the recession. It's possible we may see a similar dynamic post-pandemic, says John Sculley, who served as Apple's CEO from 1983 to 1993. ""A lot of organizations are going to say, 'Wait a minute, we don't really need all these layers of middle management that we had in the past,'"" Sculley, currently chairman of pharmacy benefit management company RxAdvance, tells CNBC Make It. Others are more optimistic that the demand for top-tier managers will rebound once the pandemic subsides because organizations will want to emphasize productivity. One fear of a flattening management structure is that fewer managers will be required to oversee a higher volume of direct reports, creating room for error, lack of oversight and mismanagement. ""I personally think good managers are always going to be in demand,"" says Oates. ""You can't have a good workforce unless you have good managers.""

Automation could be accelerated

While futurists have long warned of ""job-stealing robots,"" the coronavirus pandemic has heightened fears that automation will replace the jobs of workers. Because of social distancing measures, many organizations — from restaurants to retailers — have been forced to find ways to operate with as few employees physically present as possible. An added bonus: Robots and algorithms can't get sick. Coronavirus ""has caused an acceleration of some labor trends like automation,"" says Karen Fichuk, CEO of Randstad North America, adding that out-of-work Americans may need to develop new skills in order to find new jobs. ""What we're seeing is this significant need for massive up-skilling and retraining, especially for workers who have been laid off."" Jake Schwartz, co-founder and CEO of General Assembly, agrees that coronavirus will accelerate automation. ""It's pulling the future forward,"" he says. For years, companies have been working toward automating repetitive jobs through algorithms that can complete administrative tasks, robots that can streamline manufacturing and drones that can deliver goods. And researchers have found that this kind of automation is more quickly adopted during economic downturns. ""Companies are going to be going digital much faster, they're going to be automating much faster. And in that context, are we looking at mass unemployment? We don't know,"" says Schwartz.

There could be an increased demand to close the digital divide",1
304,304,387,Health departments are concerned about spikes in STIs while attention is on COVID-19,"Across Idaho, the number of people getting tested for sexually transmitted infections and HIV has cratered. The Department of Health and Welfare is screening far fewer people than they did at this time last year, and many community organizations that do rapid HIV testing shut down when the state’s stay-at-home order went into effect on March 25th.

“Those things kind of just stopped,” says Kevin Brinegar, HIV prevention health program specialist at the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. “That’s concerning.”

Rates of sexually transmitted infections in the United States have been steadily climbing over the past few years, with rates of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia reaching an all-time high in 2018. Now, with COVID-19 pulling the majority of public health resources, local health departments are worried that they’ll lose even more ground.

“When the dust settles on coronavirus, we’re going to find out about all the public health issues that we haven’t been able to pay attention to”

“When the dust settles on coronavirus, we’re going to find out about all the public health issues that we haven’t been able to pay attention to, and how big of a problem they’ve gotten as they’ve kind of been under the radar,” says Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs at the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO).

The NACCHO surveyed local health departments around the country to see how their HIV, STI, and viral hepatitis programs were affected by COVID-19 response efforts. Health departments reported that they’ve had to reduce or suspend some services, and that they’re concerned that those rollbacks will lead to outbreaks of diseases like syphilis, HIV, and chlamydia. Some jurisdictions have already seen increased clusters of cases.

Because of the pandemic, STI and HIV programs have limited the hours dedicated to testing and treatment clinics. “One of the most important things in the STI world is making sure that you can do open testing hours,” Casalotti says. “If you feel sick or not, you can come in, know your status, and get on your way. You can’t really do that anymore in this world of social distancing.” Clinics are also redirecting personal protective equipment to the front lines of the COVID-19 response.

In response, health departments are restructuring their priorities. Some reported that they were no longer able to start people on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication that can prevent HIV. “Individuals who have expressed interest in PrEP will be lost to care or [will] have been exposed to HIV by the time that we are able to provide PrEP services to them,” one department said in their survey response.

County health departments across Michigan have reduced some of their services, says Kristine Tuinier, manager of the division of HIV and STD programs at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. “I don’t think anyone is operating at full capacity,” she says. Most are focusing on working with people who have positive STI test results or symptoms of an infection, and they aren’t as able to screen people who feel fine.

“I don’t think anyone is operating at full capacity”

Clinicians are doing a more robust assessment of each person who comes in for testing and treatment, she says, and checking to see if a physical exam is necessary or if they can be treated without as much contact. Clinics are also using oral medications, rather than shots (which require physical contact with clinicians) to treat STIs like gonorrhea.

Many people in public health departments who usually work on STIs and HIV have also been pulled to work on the COVID-19 response. Management of STDs in communities uses some of the same methods used in the COVID-19 response — namely contact tracing, the process of finding out who may have been exposed to a disease.

In Michigan, specialists are splitting their schedules, devoting half of their time to STI work and half their time to COVID-19 contact tracing. Most Idaho health departments don’t have investigators devoted specifically to STIs to begin with — their experts all work on multiple diseases — but they have less time to devote to that response now.

“When you add something like this to the mix, it really bumps things down the priority list,” Brinegar says. “They’re staying on top of their HIV and syphilis investigations, but the way that they’re doing it and the time investment is more tailored.”

Those priorities will stay lopsided until the COVID-19 pandemic is more controlled, and it’s unclear how long that might take. “It’s not just that these people are being pulled off of their daily work in the STI space. It’s that they’re pulled off it and we don’t when they’ll be able to return to that work,” Casalotti says.

It’s not clear what the long-term impact of the novel coronavirus cuts might be for people at risk for various STIs. “We know that when we don’t pay attention to things, they bubble up and remind us,” Casalotti says. “That’s what could happen at the end of the coronavirus response.”

Many sexually transmitted infections can be asymptomatic, so it might take time for communities to realize that they have an outbreak. If untreated, they can also cause serious complications — so any undetected spread could have long-term consequences.

“Say you have a decrease in even condom availability,” Brinegar says. “If people rely on these clinic spaces to pick up free condoms routinely, and then all of a sudden that’s shut off — what’s that going to translate into?”

The challenges, though, are pushing health departments to innovate in the ways they provide care. Idaho’s health departments are looking into at-home test kits for various STIs. Michigan is trying to be more nimble in their work. “It’s changed the way we look at everything,” Tuinier says. “I think, moving forward, we’ll have gained some important skills in how we do our work.”

In addition, the proposed expansion of the COVID-19 contact tracing workforce might also benefit STI and HIV programs in the future. The coronavirus pandemic has brought new attention to disease investigation experts.

“My hope is that when we can get back into kind of our normal day to day routine, there’s a community level awareness of who these folks are — that they’re not the sex police, they’re just trying to ensure public health,” Tuinier says. “I feel like that’s going to be one good outcome from all of this.”",1
537,537,659,FDA authorizes CRISPR-based test for COVID-19,"The Food and Drug Administration has authorized a COVID-19 test that uses the gene-editing technology CRISPR and returns results in around one hour.

Though the test was only authorized for emergency use, this marks the first time the FDA has allowed a CRISPR-based tool to be used in patients. CRISPR technology can quickly find and link onto any genetic sequence in a specimen. The new test, created by the biotech company Sherlock Biosciences, uses one molecule to search for the virus gene in a patient sample. Then, if the molecule finds the gene, it releases a signal that the system can detect.

The standard method for COVID-19 testing, called PCR, also looks for tiny bits of the virus gene. However, that method is slow and takes specialized equipment to run. The recently approved Abbott test gives results in minutes but can only run on that company’s platform. CRISPR-based techniques, on the other hand, are relatively fast and only need basic equipment found in most labs.

Experts say that the United States needs to run hundreds of thousands more tests each day to control the pandemic. Rapid, simple tests could help reach that scale.

Sherlock Biosciences said in a press release that it is working to produce and distribute testing kits. Two other groups, at Mammoth Biosciences and MIT, are also working on CRISPR-based tests.",1
236,236,310,Meet The Team Behind The Coronavirus Tracker Watched By Millions,"Meet The Team Behind The Coronavirus Tracker Watched By Millions

For the latest COVID-19 statistics, updated in near real time, millions of people around the world have been turning to an interactive, Web-based dashboard created by a small team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

From its humble beginnings, that dashboard has become one of the world's most authoritative sources for the latest coronavirus numbers and trends. The project has filled an information vacuum, providing the most up-to-date, comprehensive picture of the virus' global scope and spread.

The dashboard was born, as these things often are, under the influence of caffeine.

""We were sitting around a table. We were all drinking lattes,"" recalls Lauren Gardner, 35, associate professor of civil and systems engineering at Johns Hopkins.

This was back on Jan. 21. Gardner, whose specialty is modeling the spread of infectious diseases such as Zika, dengue and measles, had been paying close attention to early reports of a deadly new virus spreading in China.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Will Kirk/Johns Hopkins University Will Kirk/Johns Hopkins University

At that meeting over coffee, she asked Ensheng Dong, a first-year Ph.D. student she advises, if he had been following news of the coronavirus. He had. Dong, 30, is from Shanxi province in China, and he knew there had been confirmed cases in his hometown.

""I really worry about my family over there,"" he told Gardner.

What's more, Dong has a lot of friends who live in Wuhan, which was then at the heart of the epidemic.

""I could see their numbers growing larger and larger every day,"" Dong says.

Gardner had an idea.

""She mentioned, 'Why don't we make a dashboard?' "" Dong says. ""I'm thinking, 'Yes. Why not?!' ""

So, Dong got busy, and by that same night he had created a dashboard showing cases of the disease, COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus.

Back then, his map was splashed with just a smattering of red circles, indicating a grand total of 320 confirmed cases. Nearly all of them were in China; a handful more were in Thailand, Japan and South Korea.

Over the months that followed, as the epidemic turned into a pandemic and as the number of confirmed cases grew from several hundred to nearly 2 million, Dong watched those red circles on the map spread steadily and fast, all over the globe.

""It's kind of a bloody map,"" Dong says. ""There's so many red dots everywhere.""

In the first few weeks, Dong was entering all of the data by himself, manually plugging the numbers of confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths into the dashboard. That quickly turned into a monumental task. Now, nearly all of the data are entered automatically.

As the dashboard grew more popular and demand surged, there were times when the servers crashed.

""Actually, if I ever knew that this project will go [so] big, maybe I would [reconsider doing] that!"" Dong jokes.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Lizao Zhang Lizao Zhang

For Gardner, who manages the dashboard project for Johns Hopkins' Center for Systems Science and Engineering, it's a role that has become all-consuming.

""I didn't envision being dashboard person — that's for sure,"" she says, noting that the dashboard she first envisioned as a valuable tool for academic research has evolved into something far bigger.

""I think what we massively underestimated was the general public's interest,"" she says. ""It didn't even cross our mind how popular the interface would be. ... People are just really desperate for information that they trust.""

The Hopkins team scrapes its numbers from dozens of sources, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, as well as U.S. state health departments and media-aggregating websites.

The dashboard team has grown from two members to a couple of dozen, and they're constantly working on new features. This week, they've added maps showing per capita rates of COVID-19 testing, hospitalization and incidence, as well as case-fatality ratios.

The team would love to have other data made available, including the race and gender of COVID-19 patients, according to Dong.

The Hopkins dashboard is open-source, made freely available to users. Thousands of other dashboards, including NPR's, pull the Hopkins data into their own. ""And I think that's awesome,"" Gardner says.

Beyond the snapshot of what is happening now, the data are also being used to do modeling, which in turn drives state and federal policy. ""We're absolutely doing short-term forecasting,"" Gardner says, ""looking at what are the next spatial hot spots. Where should we be allocating resources to better prepare for the next city or the next state that's gonna see a surge in cases?""

The Hopkins team also recently joined in a study from NASA, modeling how climate and seasonality are contributing to the coronavirus outbreak.

As the dashboard project goes on, Dong says what began with him worrying about his family in China has flipped. With the U.S. now bearing the brutal brunt of the pandemic, he says, it's his family's turn to worry about him.",1
65,65,106,"Pot sales spike at some shops in Chicago, nationally as coronavirus spreads","As many businesses take a hit amid the rising coronavirus crisis, the high times continued at some Chicago marijuana dispensaries.

Representatives for three pot shops in the city confirmed that sales have spiked as the coronavirus spread across the state in recent weeks. Meanwhile, a similar trend has played out in other states that have legalized weed.

Kris Krane, president of 4Front Ventures, a multi-state pot firm that operates the Mission dispensary in South Chicago, said Wednesday that “sales have been up everywhere.” Krane said daily sales at some of the company’s medical stores in other states had even eclipsed those of April 20, an unofficial weed holiday that typically serves as “the highest volume sales day of the year.”

Krane said sales at the Chicago dispensary peaked on Monday before dipping slightly the following day when state regulators announced new guidelines for weed stores. To comply with those new rules and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mission started limiting the number of people allowed inside at once and reduced how many registers employees can operate.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some Chicago shops have suspended recreational weed sales in order to prioritize medical patients. What’s more, GreenGate Chicago, a medical-only store in Rogers Park, announced Wednesday it was closing for two weeks, while The Herbal Care Center on the Near West Side shut down Thursday for cleaning.

Before closing their doors to recreational customers on Monday, Dispensary 33 in Uptown also saw sales jump.

“There was a bit of a spike,” said Dispensary 33 owner Bryan Zises. “We’re seeing people worried about having to leave their house and wanting to buy more than they generally would. Everyone is concerned. Everyone is just fearful.”

In terms of medical sales, Zises said a smaller number of patients are now buying more weed than they usually would. Zises noted that those folks are concerned about the state’s marijuana supply chain, which has been strained since recreational sales came online at the start of the year.

Jason Erkes, spokesman for Loop-based Cresco Labs, said the company’s store in Lake View has seen an uptick in customers in recent weeks — though it’s unclear whether the limited options have simply pushed more people to the few shops that are still selling recreational pot.

“It’s hard to gauge if we’re just picking up the people that would’ve shopped there or if they’re new people,” said Erkes

258,258,334,"Olli Maatta, Zack Smith are Blackhawks’ top buyout candidates if coronavirus crunches salary cap","Entering March, the Blackhawks already looked like a team primed to use a buyout in the offseason.

The odds of that happening — whenever the offseason ends up taking place — have only increased in the last two months.

The NHL already has lost a significant chunk of revenue because of the season pause, and if the season is canceled or only somewhat resumed, that chunk will get larger.

And since the salary cap is directly correlated to league revenues — it’s technically half the upcoming season’s projected revenue, divided by 31 — that huge financial fallout could quickly spill down to the player’s pockets.

The Hawks already were looking at a salary-cap crunch, even with the cap expected to rise from its current $81.5 million to the $84 million-$88 million range. But if the cap stays around $81.5 million — which players were reportedly informed recently will likely be the case — general manager Stan Bowman’s situation could get even more dire.

That could affect the Hawks’ ability to re-sign pending free agents such as Dylan Strome, Dominik Kubalik and Corey Crawford.

But it also could — alternately, or perhaps simultaneously — lead to one or two buyouts of Hawks players with years left on their contracts.

Under the standard buyout rules — which are complicated and highly variable but generally spread out a player’s expected cap hit over more years at a lower amount per year — the Hawks have two prime candidates: defenseman Olli Maatta and forward Zack Smith.

Maatta was acquired from the Penguins last summer to help fix the Hawks’ defense. He didn’t have an outright bad debut season, but he made little difference. Maatta finished with 17 points and a 47.5 percent scoring-chance ratio (per Natural Stat Trick) in 65 games.

He has two years remaining at an expensive $4.08 million cap hit per year, and it just so happens that his contract is buyout-friendly. It would result in a mere $680,000 cap hit for the next four years, per Capfriendly.

Olli Maatta Buyout Data Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings 2020-21 4,083,333 680,600 3,402,733 2021-22 4,083,333 680,400 3,402,933 2022-23 0 680,567 -680,567 2023-24 0 680,567 -680,567

The Hawks acquired Smith from the Senators last summer while dumping Artem Anisimov’s contract.

But Smith, too, is heavily overpaid (one year remaining at $3.25 million) for a slowing-down fourth-liner. He finished with 11 points and a team-worst 40.4 percent scoring-chance ratio in 50 games, then was ruled out for the season with a back injury.

His contract is slightly less buyout-friendly than Maatta’s, but he’s also a far more expendable player. A buyout would create a cap hit slightly under $1.1 million for the next two seasons.

Zack Smith Buyout Data Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings 2020-21 3,250,000 1,083,333 2,166,667 2021-22 0 1,083,333 -1,083,333

Meanwhile, the NHL could look into offering compliance buyouts, which completely erase contracts from the books with no penalties. The league offered these in the 2013 and 2014 offseasons after the 2012-13 lockout stalled cap growth.

In this scenario, the choice would be clear for the Hawks: Brent Seabrook’s contract is an albatross. He’s due $6.875 million for four more seasons. Despite Seabrook’s admirable fight back from three surgeries during the winter, Bowman would be delusional not to use a compliance buyout on the one-time defensive stalwart.

Brent Seabrook Compliance Buyout Data Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings 2020-21 6,875,000 0 6,875,000 2021-22 6,875,000 0 6,875,000 2022-23 6,875,000 0 6,875,000 2023-24 6,875,000 0 6,875,000

But a conventional buyout remains impractical. Most of Seabrook’s cap hit is packed into a signing bonus that can’t be mitigated in any way.",1

SUMMARY: Republicans who just bailed out thousands of private companies and supported a vast increase in federal deficit-spending now want states to declare bankruptcy. Is that a smart idea? Can we save our cities when the pandemic ends, or will they now decline for decades? Biden needs to respond personally to the sexual-assault allegation.

Should states just ""declare bankruptcy?""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump Drew Angerer/Getty Images

As states shell out billions of dollars on unemployment and other responses to the coronavirus—and as business shutdowns and payroll and sales tax declines whack tax revenue—state budgets are being blown apart.

New York State, for example, foresees at least a $10 billion to $15 billion budget shortfall this year.

To address this, many governors and economists are recommending that the federal government put emergency funding for the states into the next coronavirus response package. Some members of the GOP, however — including President Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Florida Sen. Rick Scott — have responded by saying that states should instead just ""declare bankruptcy.""

Is this a smart idea?

No.

Forcing states to declare bankruptcy right now would have the same effect as forcing dozens of giant airlines, hotel chains, and other companies to declare bankruptcy — namely, triggering millions of additional layoffs as states are forced to cut spending and, thereby, radically worsening the country's overall economic crisis.

The federal government has rightly chosen to extend lifelines to private companies hit by the crisis, and these bailouts have helped stabilize the economy. The GOP and White House helped design and pass these emergency funds to the private sector. So the suggestion that states should declare bankruptcy, when companies should not, stems mostly from political ideology rather than economic common sense.

Another argument put forth by the GOP — in particular, Florida Sen. Scott, himself a former governor — is that solvent states shouldn't have to bail out insolvent ones.

This argument sounds reasonable at first. Some states do have persistent fiscal challenges. And it is fine and reasonable for states that run tight ships to complain about having to support profligate neighbors. But the argument ignores the fact that some of the states that need help now normally subsidize the states that are now complaining.

An analysis by the Rockefeller Institute of Government found that, in fiscal 2018, 8 states sent more money to the federal government than they received back. The 42 other states, meanwhile, ran a deficit with the federal government, meaning that they received net subsidies.

In Rockefeller's chart below, the orange states—including New York—sent net money to Washington. All the others received it.

Given the deficit the federal government is running — an annual deficit that has ballooned to nearly $4 trillion in recent weeks with the passage of massive emergency spending plans approved by members of both parties — it's also hypocritical for national leaders to lecture state leaders about being fiscally responsible.

The federal government doesn't have to think about ""declaring bankruptcy,"" because we citizens have given it the power to print and borrow money. The federal government is supposed to use this power to help us, and it is.

The next important way the federal government can help us is to enable our state and local governments get through this crisis without having to cut services and fire millions of Americans.

Then, once the crisis is over, if the GOP still feels passionate about it, we can have a discussion about how and when states should subsidize each other. — HB

How to save our cities as the pandemic ends

Post-pandemic cities will be depressing places.

The disease is already undoing the density that's made downtowns so bustling, active, walkable, energy efficient, and rich. Post-pandemic, many who can afford to work and live remotely will likely shy away from the urban core.

The decline in workers, shoppers, and tourists will devastate the restaurant and retail economies. Theaters and art galleries will close. There will be a drop in new immigrants remaking neighborhoods and enriching urban culture.

It will suck.

There's almost universal agreement about how cities are likely to suffer. (Read these excellent stories if you want to feel really gloomy.) But there's less certainty about how they can recover.

The Atlantic's Derek Thompson notes that there's a natural boom-bust cycle in American cities: They get dense and rich, then empty out because of some unexpected societal upheaval (deindustrialization, urban unrest). This eventually lowers rents, which draws immigrants and cultural pioneers, and that in turn attracts money and more people, and the cities thrive again. If COVID-19 hollows out downtowns, they will eventually come back,

But ""eventually"" is a mighty long time — probably decades. That's not solace for city lovers today. Is there any way to speed up the post-pandemic cycle?

I think there is.

The post-pandemic city won't work until people feel safe, and for now, they won't feel safe without a transformation in the urban environment. Israel's an instructive example: After a spate of terrorist bombings 20 years ago, Israel began placing guards at the entrances to malls and markets. Israelis quickly felt safe shopping and gathering again. It was costly, but a lot cheaper than abandoning the markets.

Post-pandemic, American cities will need to make an even more sweeping physical transformation, and fast. Handwashing stations at every storefront; cleaning teams to wipe down surfaces; the spreading out of tables in restaurants and chairs in classrooms and seats in theaters; touchless pickup of groceries; touchless thermometer stations...the list goes on and on. And we don't yet know which of these changes will make people feel safe from infection (or actually make them be safe).

So here's a free idea for a billionaire tired of cocooning in a New Zealand bunker. Pick a single block in a city you love and fund every restaurant, apartment building, school, police station, day care, and office on that block to make themselves safe. Retrofit the restaurants to be less dense, and build a separate pickup entrance. Pay the daycare center to have a full-time cleaning person. Install handwashing stations in every classroom and office.

Create a model for a post-pandemic urban neighborhood, where people live and work together in the new way. If it works, it will quickly be copied in other neighborhoods and other cities, and cities will recover much faster. —DP

Pressure increases on Biden to personally address sexual-assault allegation

Yesterday, Insider published more corroboration of the 1993 sexual-assault allegation against former Vice President Biden.

Biden's campaign responded by pointing to its previous assertion that the allegation made by former staffer Tara Reade is false.

But there is now corroboration for this allegation, as there has been for similar allegations against other high-profile government figures, including Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and President Trump.

Kavanaugh directly responded to the allegations against him. President Trump has directly —and dismissively—responded to the many sexual assault allegations against him.

So Biden will likely have to respond himself to this one. And how he does so will be revealing.

Even as Democrats cringe at the idea that their leading hope to win back the White House has been hit with an allegation like this, they should want to hear what he has to say about it.

Will the allegation hurt Biden's chances of winning the Presidency? Or, like the plans of the latest corroborator of the allegation, Lynda LaCasse, will Democrats decide to vote for Biden? — HB

A silver lining… Miami just went seven weeks without a homicide.

An empty Ocean Drive amid the coronavirus pandemic. Taylor Borden/Business Insider

That's the longest stretch since 1957, and it is a rare bit of good pandemic news.

But is COVID-19 the universal crime fighter? The effect of the pandemic on crime is surprisingly erratic, and not yet clear. Murders are down in some places, but up in others. Property crime is surging in some cities, while drug crimes are down. Authorities expected a rise in domestic violence since people are cooped up at home, but are unsettled to find that some cities, including Los Angeles, are experiencing a drop in domestic violence calls, leading to fears that victims are afraid to call the police because they can't get away from their abusers. — DP

Blaming the victims of COVID-19

Last week the New York Times profiled a Fox-News-watching bar owner in Brooklyn who died after expressing skepticism about Covid-19. This week, the Washington Post took a turn: ""A Virginia preacher believed 'God can heal anything.' Then he caught coronavirus.""

In neither story was the victim the actual target: The purpose of the Times piece was to smack Fox News, especially Sean Hannity, for downplaying the disease. (Hannity is now threatening to sue the Times about it.) And the Post paints a subtle, sympathetic portrait of preacher Landon Spradlin, and criticizes others for mocking Spradlin. But the nut of the story was: Spradlin —""an avid Trump supporter"" posted something on Facebook about ""mass hysteria"" around the virus, then caught COVID-19 and died.

I don't get the point of these stories, which reduce rich, complicated lives to an ironic punchline. I also suspect they infuriate the very people they are intended to reach. — DP",1
1272,1274,1681,"Coronavirus-jolted finances may be worse than feared, LA officials say","By ERIC HEINZ, City News Service

Los Angeles may find itself in a worse financial situation than envisioned in the mayor’s proposed budget for the next fiscal year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, city officials said Thursdsay, May 21.

According to Chief Legislative Analyst Sharon Tso, the city’s Office of Finance is anticipating 2021 tax revenues will be a minimum of $45 million short of Mayor Eric Garcetti’s proposed budget and could fall short by as much as $400 million, depending upon how quickly the economy recovers.

“There is no doubt that we are going to be facing a difficult fiscal year,” Council President Nury Martinez said. “But even in difficult years, this council has delivered by focusing on the most vulnerable communities in our city. As we start the new fiscal year, it is important to keep in mind the people who need us the most right now.”

Although Los Angeles has been using financial tactics to pay for essential materials to combat the coronavirus pandemic, the lagging economy may not catch up fast enough before the city is forced to further dip into its reserves.

Councilman Paul Krekorian, the council’s Budget and Finance Committee chair, said that although tax returns for May have not been calculated, the city’s sales tax revenues were down 10% in March and 17% in April compared to last year, and the city’s hotel tax revenues were down 11% in March and 77% in April.

“The fear is that this is only going to get worse from here and that we’re going to be faced with even more difficult choices,” Councilman Bob Blumenfield said.

The budget process for Los Angeles will continue through June, as the city looks for ways to brace for the financial effects of COVID-19.

The Budget and Finance Committee is planning to meet June 8, 15, 22 and 29 to examine the budget, but Krekorian said it’s not possible to examine each department’s finances at great length this year.

“Even if we had considered all of those lengthy hearings that we typically have, the truth is the level of uncertainty over all of the assumptions that we rely on for our budget is greater now than it has ever been, probably in the city’s history,” Krekorian said.

Los Angeles’ entire budget is proposed to be about $10.5 billion for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1, with an operating general fund of about $6.6 billion.

Los Angeles has already spent $155 million in special fund loans on personal protective equipment and other COVID-19 preventions, but much of those funds could be reimbursed through Federal Emergency Management Agency funds.

Much of the funding for loans is coming from the Department of Building and Safety, and those loans have interest attached to them and must be repaid eventually.

Another $82 million from various funding sources has been used to cover COVID-19 testing kits, senior meals, small business micro loans and other programs.

COVID-19 testing has taken up more than half of those expenses at $43 million, and city officials said they’re trying to have the county take over its testing sites, as it may receive federal funding to do so.

Los Angeles estimates it will receive about $694 million in federal coronavirus relief, but those funds can be used only for responding to the virus and have to be spent by the end of 2020.

The funds cannot be used to replenish revenues the city anticipated it would have received prior to the pandemic.

“We really need to spend those dollars on COVID-specific responses within that time frame,” said Matthew Szabo, Mayor Eric Garcetti’s deputy chief of staff.

But the city has already had to dip into its reserves, which have fallen from a “robust” 8.5% of the general fund, about $407 million, and will likely be down to 3.6%, or $243 million, by the start of the next fiscal year. City Administrative Officer Richard Llewellyn said the reserves are “dangerously low.”

Los Angeles was facing difficult budget decisions prior to the pandemic related to pay raises and contracts with public safety departments, which make up most of the city’s operating budget.

The Los Angeles Police Department’s budget for this year was about $1.73 billion, and next year it is expected to be increase to $1.85 billion.

Public speakers said Wednesday and Thursday they opposed the proposal to increase the LAPD budget, contending that the money should be used for housing and COVID-19 prevention efforts.

Councilman Mike Bonin asked if there was a way to defer pay raises in response to the pandemic. Neither the LAPD nor Los Angeles Fire Department budgets are in line to see decreases compared to this year.

Llewellyn said he did not want to discuss labor negotiations in a public setting, but “everything is on the table.”

Some notable services that are expected to be reduced include capital improvement projects, graffiti abatement, tree services, animal sterilization and the mayor’s Gang Reeducation and Youth Development program.

“Our effort here … was to not cut entirely or eliminate any particular portion of a department or a program, but to try to manage the reductions across the city,” Szabo said.

The city has enacted a hiring freeze, estimated to save $42 million next year, and it plans to furlough 15,000 of its civilian employees for 26 days next year to save $139 million.

Councilman David Ryu said as the city considers the budget, it should not make cuts to services that help homeless people, the elderly, victims of domestic violence and other vulnerable populations.

“If we make cuts to departments and services that serve low-income and working families, we will be paying for those cuts for decades to come,” Ryu said.",1
1073,1073,1277,Diamond Princess cruise ship leaves Japan months after coronavirus outbreak to get last of crew home,"The Diamond Princess – the cruise ship that was part of an early coronavirus outbreak – is on the move from Japan to Malaysia, Princess Cruises said.

Princess Cruises spokeswoman Negin Kamali said 170 employees are currently aboard the ship bound for Port Dickson, Malaysia, ""to finalize crew repatriation efforts and remain until operations begin."" Details about crew members' nationalities and repatriation details were not immediately available.

The ship had been docked in Japan since early February, where officials attempted to quarantine its 3,700 passengers and crew for two weeks after 10 initial coronavirus cases were reported Feb. 4.

Eventually, 712 people who had been on the ship tested positive, and 13 died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. By mid-February, it was the largest coronavirus outbreak outside China, where the pandemic is believed to have begun in December.

Around 400 American citizens were evacuated on two State Department charter flights in late February, including 14 who had tested positive. Public health experts have widely criticized the quarantine and the subsequent evacuation for worsening the outbreak.

""The quarantine process failed,"" Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, told the USA TODAY editorial board in February. ""I'd like to sugarcoat it and try to be diplomatic about it, but it failed.""

Another coronavirus outbreak in early March on the Grand Princess and a growing global crisis led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a no-sail order for cruise ships March 14. The no-sail order was extended and is in force through late July.

The Diamond Princess has lingered in Japan in the meantime. Kamali said the ship left Yokohama, Japan, on Saturday.

About 200 employees replaced mattresses, bedding, linens and room ornaments as part of a sanitation and refurbishment project while the ship was docked at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama Dockyard and Machinery Works.

Kamali said Japan home port cruises on the Diamond Princess have been canceled through Oct. 1. Princess said earlier this month that it would cancel cruises through the end of the summer season, citing the reduction in flight schedules and the closure of cruise ship ports.",1
204,204,274,Inmates In Washington State Protest After Fellow Prisoners Test Positive For COVID-19,"Inmates In Washington State Protest After Fellow Prisoners Test Positive For COVID-19

Enlarge this image toggle caption Elaine Thompson/AP Elaine Thompson/AP

Dozens of inmates at the Monroe Correctional Complex in Washington state have staged a brief protest after several fellow prisoners tested positive for the novel coronavirus in recent days.

In a statement issued late Wednesday, the Department of Corrections Washington State said that around 6 p.m. local time more than 100 men at the prison's minimum-security unit ""began engaging in a demonstration in the recreation yard.""

It said fire extinguishers were set off in two housing units at the facility and that verbal directives were obeyed by about half the prisoners, but that the others initially refused to comply.

""All measures to bring individuals into compliance were ignored including verbal directives, pepper (OC) spray and sting balls, which release light, noise, and rubber pellets,"" the statement said.

It said that the situation was brought under control with no injuries and that the facility is now on restricted movement.

""It is believed at this time that the incident was caused by recent positive test results of COVID-19 among six men within the Minimum Security Unit,"" the statement said. ""Those six men were transferred from the Minimum Security Unit on Sunday to the facility's isolation unit.""

It said inmates in the housing unit where the first positive tests for coronavirus were discovered ""continue to have no symptoms of illness or disease (asymptomatic) and are wearing surgical masks for further protection.""

The corrections department announced Sunday that an inmate in the minimum-security unit had tested positive for the virus and on Wednesday that two more, a 68-year-old and a 28-year-old prisoner, also had been diagnosed, according to KOMO News.

KOMO reported that prison staff had been ordered to wear N95 masks and that prisoners in the minimum-security unit were required to undergo body temperature checks.

In a telephone interview earlier this month with Northwest News Network, Arthur Longworth, who has served 35 years at Monroe on a sentence of life without parole for aggravated murder, said prisoners in his medium-security unit have been put on quarantine since a staff member tested positive for coronavirus.

Longworth, who is an award-winning prison writer, said he fears that the disease could spread quickly through the prison because of tight spaces, shared quarters and dense populations.

He said he fears an outbreak of COVID-19 could sweep through the facility in the same way as a fire would.

""I've been in fires in the cell block before, it's a scary thing,"" he said. ""And when the virus gets in here, as it has, it feels kind of like that.""",1
348,348,439,"Wolves’ Brandon Pirri keeping perspective, lending voice during COVID-19 season stoppage","On March 12, Brandon Pirri was with the Vegas Golden Knights and preparing to play the Wild in St. Paul, Minnesota, when the NHL announced it was suspending its season due to COVID-19. After starting the season in the NHL before getting sent to the Wolves in November, Pirri had earned his third Vegas recall in the last month and seemed to be back in the Golden Knights’ plans.

Then the pandemic stopped the season and Pirri’s latest shot in the NHL. But Pirri, 29, is keeping it all in perspective.

“I am aware of what’s going on,” said Pirri, who was sent back to the Wolves on March 14. “It was good to be back up, but at the same time it’s a game. It’s a sport, and wherever I am I get to play hockey for a living, and I feel very fortunate. Health and safety is everything, and it is what it is. I’m sure I’m not the only guy going through this, and to be kind of frustrated by it isn’t going to do me any good, or basically anyone else, because it’s just a matter of getting through this time and taking care of one another.”

Pirri has spread that message through All In Illinois, a state initiative stressing the importance of sheltering at home. Pirri recorded a television commercial for All In, lending his voice along with luminaries such as Hillary Clinton, Common and Chance the Rapper, and sports figures like Mike Singletary, Patrick Kane, David Ross, Jim Thome and Toni Kukoc. During the 56-second spot, Pirri says he’s really happy to live in a state that has taken the pandemic so seriously, talks about how many of life’s biggest moments took place in Illinois, and said “us non-essential workers need to stay home and do our part together.”

Pirri said he was asked through the Wolves to participate and hopes his voice could influence people to be safe and help stop the spread of the virus. After all, Pirri is going through this just like everyone else. He even had to tell his two-year-old son, Luca, that the park was closed.

“I saw Kaner did it, so if people are listening to him, that’s huge,” Pirri said. “The more people that can get behind this, the sooner we all can get through it, because the whole flatten-the-curve idea seems to be the only way we’re going to get back to our normal lives. I was asked to do it, and that’s an easy ask.”

If the curve is flattened, maybe the season can continue in some form. When the season was halted, Pirri indicated he thought the games would return and that a solution could be found somewhat quickly. But as more information came out, he came to the realization this wouldn’t be over quickly.

“At first I was thinking stay ready, and now [I’m] waiting it out like everyone else,” Pirri said. “Obviously, there’s only so many pushups and situps you can do, but that’s just kind of the way it is right now. It would be great to be playing hockey, but the world’s got to figure out a bigger issue right now.”",1
341,341,431,Coronavirus Antibody Tests: Can You Trust the Results?,"
The researchers worked around the clock, in shifts of three to five hours, hoping to stave off weariness and keep their minds sharp for the delicate task.
They set up lines of laboratory volunteers: medical residents, postdoctoral students, even experienced veterans of science, each handling a specific task. They checked and rechecked their data, as if the world were depending on it. Because in some ways, it is.
For the past few weeks, more than 50 scientists have been working diligently to do something that the Food and Drug Administration mostly has not: Verifying that 14 coronavirus antibody tests now on the market actually deliver accurate results.
These tests are crucial to reopening the economy, but public health experts have raised urgent concerns about their quality. The new research, completed just days ago and posted online Friday, confirmed some of those fears: Of the 14 tests, only three delivered consistently reliable results. Even the best had some flaws.
The research has not been peer-reviewed and is subject to revision. But the results are already raising difficult questions about the course of the epidemic.
Surveys of residents in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and New York this week found that substantial percentages tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the official name of the new coronavirus. In New York City, the figure was said to be as high as 21 percent. Elsewhere, it was closer to 3 percent.
The idea that many residents in some parts of the country have already been exposed to the virus has wide implications. At the least, the finding could greatly complicate plans to reopen the economy.
Already Americans are scrambling to take antibody tests to see if they might escape lockdowns. Public health experts are wondering if those with positive results might be allowed to return to work.
But these tactics mean nothing if the test results can’t be trusted.In the new research, researchers found that only one of the tests never delivered a so-called false positive — that is, it never mistakenly signaled antibodies in people who did not have them.
Two other tests did not deliver false-positive results 99 percent of the time.But the converse was not true. Even these three tests detected antibodies in infected people only 90 percent of the time, at best.
The false-positive metric is particularly important. The result may lead people to believe themselves immune to the virus when they are not, and to put themselves in danger by abandoning social distancing and other protective measures.
It is also the result on which scientists are most divided.“There are multiple tests that look reasonable and promising,” said Dr. Alexander Marson, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and one of the project’s leaders. “That’s some reason for optimism.”
Dr. Marson is also an investigator in the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, which partly funded the study.Other scientists were less sanguine than Dr. Marson. Four of the tests produced false-positive rates ranging from 11 percent to 16 percent; many of the rest hovered around 5 percent.
“Those numbers are just unacceptable,” said Scott Hensley, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania. “The tone of the paper is, ‘Look how good the tests are.’ But I look at these data, and I don’t really see that.”
The proportion of people in the United States who have been exposed to the coronavirus is likely to be 5 percent or less, Dr. Hensley said. “If your kit has a 3 percent false-positive, how do you interpret that? It’s basically impossible,” he said. “If your kit has 14 percent false positive, it’s useless.”
Dr. Hensley said the study nonetheless was well designed and the results pressing, given the sudden proliferation of antibody tests on the market and the push to use them to lift lockdowns.
“I think this is exactly the kind of study that we need right now,” he said.Dr. Marson and his colleagues said they were drawn to the study for that very reason.
As universities in the Bay Area shut down all research not related to the coronavirus, some researchers began focusing on ways to improve diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2.
Dr. Marson and his collaborator, Patrick Hsu, a bioengineer at the University of California, Berkeley, anticipated that antibody tests would also face questions about quality.
In mid-March, Dr. Hsu heard that a friend, a venture capitalist who owns a network of 1,000 community clinics in the New York area, had ordered thousands of rapid antibody tests. Investors and entrepreneurs seemed to be distributing them around San Francisco, too.
“I realized, ‘Gosh this is really the Wild West,’” Dr. Hsu said. “We needed to figure out which of these would really work.”
The duo recruited Dr. Jeffrey Whitman and Dr. Caryn Bern, who last year published an analysis of antibody tests for Chagas disease. Other graduate students and postdoctoral fellows volunteered to help perform the evaluations.
The team began with a modified version of the method Dr. Whitman had devised to validate Chagas tests. The researchers created a biosafety-certified space, obtained the needed approvals and procured hundreds of blood samples from two Bay Area hospitals.
They also purchased tests from Chinese manufacturers, clearing customs regulations and sometimes accepting Uber deliveries in the middle of the night.
In all, the investigators analyzed 10 rapid tests that deliver a yes-no signal for antibodies, and two tests using a lab technique known as Elisa that indicate the amount of antibodies present and are generally considered to be more reliable.
Suited up in protective gear, the team worked in shifts of three to five hours in a sort of socially distanced factory line.
One researcher spotted the test with a blood sample, and another added the necessary chemical solutions; then two independent readers looked at the test, and a last person recorded the results. Still other team members analyzed the results, sometimes working through the night.
In the early hours of recent mornings, they handed the baton to Dr. Tyler Miller and his colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital, who were conducting a slightly different analysis of three tests, including one evaluated in San Francisco.
The Bay Area team finished evaluating 12 tests in record time, less than a month. By comparison, the Chagas project required a team of three people working for more than a year just to compare four tests.
Having a study design already in hand helped speed the work, but there was one key difference. Decades of data have shown that Chagas disease elicits lifelong immunity. For this study, the team had no idea how quickly SARS-CoV-2 antibodies might turn up in the blood, or at what levels.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook.| Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]New tests also usually compete with an established gold standard. Lacking such a standard, the team instead compared all the tests in a “head-to-head bake-off to see who’s the winner,” Dr. Hsu said.
Each test was evaluated with the same set of blood samples: from 80 people known to be infected with the coronavirus, at different points after infection; 108 samples donated before the pandemic; and 52 samples from people who were positive for other viral infections but had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Tests made by Sure Biotech and Wondfo Biotech, along with an in-house Elisa test, produced the fewest false positives.
A test made by Bioperfectus detected antibodies in 100 percent of the infected samples, but only after three weeks of infection. None of the tests did better than 80 percent until that time period, which was longer than expected, Dr. Hsu said.
The lesson is that the tests are less likely to produce false negatives the longer ago the initial infection occurred, he said.
The tests were particularly variable when looking for a transient antibody that comes up soon after infection, called IgM, and more consistent in identifying a subsequent antibody, called IgG, that may signal longer-term immunity.
“You can see that antibody levels rise at different points for every patient,” Dr. Hsu said. The tests performed best when the researchers assessed both types of antibodies together. None of the tests could say whether the presence of these antibodies means a person is protected from reinfection, however.
The results overall are promising, Dr. Marson added. “There are multiple tests that have specificities greater than 95 percent.”
Rapid antibody tests are generally used to get a simple yes-no result, but the team assigned the positive results — which appear as bands on a test strip — a score from zero to six. They trained readers to interpret those results, and found their decisions often agreed and were supported by the more quantitative Elisa tests.
“If you train the readers well, they can start to be reliable,” Dr. Marson said of rapid tests. “That is critical to understand if these tests could ever be deployed.”
The team at Mass General set a higher bar for specificity; they considered a score of one for the intensity of a band to be a negative result, rather than a score of zero.
Perhaps because they eliminated the fainter bands — the ones most likely to be erroneous — their estimate of specificity for BioMedomics, the one test that was evaluated by both teams, was more than 99 percent, compared with the San Francisco team’s estimate of 87 percent.
Other experts were skeptical of the scoring approach, however. “That’s not really a method that would give you a real quantitation,” said Florian Krammer of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.
Dr. Krammer has developed a two-step Elisa test that he said has 100 percent specificity and delivers a measure of the quantity of IgM and IgG antibodies a person has. Scoring a rapid test’s bands might offer some data for a scientific study, he said, “but I would not make any decisions based on that.”
Dr. Krammer said false positives are less of an issue for assessing how widely the virus has spread in the population. If a test has a known false-positive rate, scientists can factor that into their calculations, he said.
But false positives become dangerous when making policy and personal decisions about who can go back to work. “You don’t want anybody back to work who has a false positive — that’s the last thing you want to do,” Dr. Krammer said.
Scanwell Health, a Los Angeles-based start-up, has ordered millions of test kits from Innovita, a Chinese manufacturer, and has applied to the Food and Drug Administration to market the tests for at-home use.
In the new study, the Innovita test detected antibodies in 83 percent of infected people and yielded a false-positive rate of 4 percent.
Dr. Jack Jeng, chief medical officer of Scanwell Health, said the study looked at an earlier version of Innovita’s test and not the “newer, improved version” his company had ordered. “It will be interesting to see how it performs,” he said.
Dr. Marson and his colleagues have acquired tests from nearly 100 manufacturers, and plan to continue comparing them. The scientists also hope to expand their sample set to include people who were mildly ill or did not feel ill at all, and to stratify their data by age and the presence of chronic conditions.
“This is just the beginning,” Dr. Marson said. “Our goal would be to keep going till we feel there’s adequate supply in the market.”",1
1177,1177,1493,The Reason Donald Trump Will Take a Pill But Not Advice,"He has a knack for creating confusion and distraction when he needs to alter news cycles and scramble storylines. And he has a showman’s instinct for grabbing attention. But what his surprising announcement reveals most clearly is his steadfast, decades-long aversion to expertise. Trump’s deep-seated outsider mindset engendered a willful disregard for advice that often got him into trouble—financial, reputational and otherwise. In the end, though, whether it was his ill-conceived airline, his debt-saddled casinos or his professional football misadventure, Trump’s failure to heed warnings from even his most trusted advisers often served to enhance his celebrity with a sufficient portion of the public that doesn’t take the time to parse the particulars.

“He thinks he’s the smartest guy on the planet,” former Trump Shuttle president Bruce Nobles told me Tuesday. “He really does.”

“It’s like when he used the Sharpie on that hurricane map,” said former Trump Organization executive vice president Barbara Res, referring to the episode last year in which Trump cartoonishly used a marker to alter a map of the path of a storm and then fought about it for a week rather than admit the smallest of mistakes.

And now with hydroxychloroquine? “He’s going to prove that he was right,” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump political adviser, “when everybody else said he was wrong.”

“Allll about the base,” Republican strategist and Trump critic Rick Wilson told me in a text on Tuesday.

“He’s got to tell those people, ‘Of course I’m taking hydroxy,’” former Trump White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci explained. “‘They’re telling you it doesn’t work, but I’m telling you it does. I am your chief of the red tribe of Trump.’”

Experts? Who needs experts? “It would take an hour and a half to learn everything there is to learn about missiles,” Trump said in 1984, telling a reporter he wanted to negotiate with the Soviet Union about the threat of nuclear war. “I think I know most of it anyway.”

As the owner of the New Jersey Generals of the fledging, second-tier United States Football League, Trump “didn’t know whether a football was pumped or stuffed,” in the words of an official from the team from Michigan—but he nonetheless dismissed the suggestions of the coach that he hired while drafting and trading players and inking ill-considered contracts. He also, and even more disastrously, wanted to compete directly with the bigger, better, richer National Football League by playing games in the fall instead of the spring, and he didn’t want to wait—even after outside consultants penned a report recommending that the USFL stick with the spring slate, and slow, steady growth. Trump, however, convinced enough of his fellow owners it was “bullshit.” And the decision he drove to challenge the NFL in court did more than just tank. It killed the league for good. That was in 1986.",1
1252,1253,1647,CONFIRMED: Coronavirus vaccines will contain aborted human babies,"(Natural News) Pro-lifers everywhere had better think long and hard about what they plan to do in the event that state or local governments try to mandate vaccination for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) once a jab is commercially released because chances are those syringes will contain the remnants of aborted babies.

Even though President Trump has said that Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines will not be mandated at the federal level, there is still the possibility that some states may try to force them locally, which will put not just those opposed to vaccination in a tough position but also those who recognize the sanctity of unborn human life.

After it was announced recently that Canada’s largest federal research and development organization has teamed up with a Chinese vaccine company to test a new trial coronavirus vaccine in Canada, Dr. Alan Moy, M.D., founder and scientific director of the John Paul II Medical Research Institute and CEO of Cellular Engineering Technologies decided to do some digging, upon which he discovered that the test vaccine in question is made from aborted fetal cell lines.

CanSino Biologics Inc., also known as CanSinoBIO, is the name of the Chinese firm that partnered up with Canada’s National Research Council (NRC) to conduct trials on Ad5-nCoV, as it is being called, which Dr. Moy found contains a cell line known as HEK293 that was derived from unborn children that were murdered while still inside their mothers’ wombs.

“Since it’s using an adenovirus replication-defective vector, it is using HEK293,” Dr. Moy told LifeSiteNews. “HEK293 is an aborted fetal cell line.”

What’s worse, Ad5-nCoV probably won’t even work

Besides its unethical origins, the Ad5-nCoV more than likely will not even work as promised, Dr. Moy warns. As it turns out, there is a high incidence of immunity against Ad5, so most of the people who are injected with it will confer no protection whatsoever against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“I don’t envy Canadians,” Dr. Moy is further quoted as saying. “Your government and PM (prime minister) have mandated draconian policies that are anti-life … Not a good vaccine solution if pro-life or pro-choice.”

What is further confounding is the fact that Canada would even agree to contract with a vaccine company based out of China, which is where this whole crisis originated. Ad5-nCoV was reportedly also co-developed by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology which, like all other Chinese institutions, is governed and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

This vaccine is said to be the first “phase 2” coronavirus vaccine, meaning it has been approved to be “safely” used in human test subjects. And the Canadian government could not be more excited about the prospect of injecting as many Canadians as possible with it to “cure” them of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“NRC is proud of our ongoing partnership with CanSino Biologics,” stated NRC President Iain Stewart in a recent press release.

Dr. Xuefeng Yu, chairman and CEO of CanSinoBIO, also stated in the same press release that his company has “strong connections to Canada” and is “proud to be building on past successes and continuing our ongoing partnership with the NRC to address health needs on a global scale.”

Amazingly, both the NRC and CanSinoBIO are proud of their proprietary HEK293 aborted baby cell line, which they say will help “to advance a scale-up production process for the vaccine candidate.” In other words, thanks to these aborted babies, Canada and China will be able to produce Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines for mass distribution much faster than normal, paving the way for a global vaccination campaign unlike anything the world has ever seen.

390,390,486,No one knows when the COVID-19 pandemic will end,"If you’ve been marking the pandemic by the pileup of cautious reopenings and rescheduled events, you might think that an end to this global disaster is in sight. Event planners for the Kentucky Derby and Bonnaroo already have new opening days on the books in September. The Olympics are scheduled to start in Tokyo on July 23rd, 2021. There’s just one problem: if anyone says that they know exactly when this pandemic will be over, they are lying.

No one can see the future. The virus is an unknown player, and the best minds on Earth can’t do more than make educated guesses about what comes next and when. Hell, we didn’t even notice the blood clot situation until just recently.

I know. A guess is not comforting when you’re dreading another week of monotony in the same four walls. End dates are comforting. Reopenings are comforting. Contemplating a future that looks a lot like our cozy, crowded past is way more comforting than our isolated present. But let’s not confuse comfort for truth.

a future that looks a lot like our cozy, crowded past is way more comforting than our isolated present

When bowling alleys and tattoo parlors reopened in Georgia on Friday, the pandemic was not over. It won’t be over when the stay-at-home order in Michigan (maybe) lifts on May 15th or if the stay-at-home order in the Bay Area actually ends on May 31st.

The dates politicians are throwing around are not finish lines. They aren’t guesses at an end date for this pandemic, either. Shelter-in-place orders are just time-outs. We have no sure-fire treatments for the virus, no vaccine, and a limited supply of health care workers. To keep as many people alive as possible, we’ve done the only thing we can do to slow the spread: we’ve hid from each other.

The virus’s effects have not been, as some proposed, a great equalizer. The less you have, the harder you’re hit. The federal government has mostly failed at leading a coherent response to the pandemic. Doctors are clashing with the FBI over PPE, then running into the ER with whatever they can scrounge up. Governors are hitting up their private-jet-owner friends to have masks flown in from China to equip their hospitals. Nurses at other facilities are resorting to wearing garbage bags in an unsuccessful bid to avoid contracting the virus on the job.

People who are already vulnerable are getting hit the hardest. Death rates have soared in black communities already slammed by other public health crises. On the Navajo Nation, experts worry that water shortages are contributing to the virus’s continued spread. The virus has raged through cramped homeless shelters and through the communities that can’t afford to distance themselves. “It’s become very clear to me what a socioeconomic disease this is,” an ER doctor working in Elmhurst, Queens told The New Yorker. “People hear that term ‘essential workers.’ Short-order cooks, doormen, cleaners, deli workers—that is the patient population here.” In some US prisons, the vast majority of inmates are testing positive for the virus, leaving incarcerated persons in fear for their lives. One inmate, Sterling Rivers, grimly observed that “Our sentences have turned into death sentences” in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Our failures around the coronavirus are systemic failures of public policy.

Thanks to an inconsistent and often incoherent government response in the US, we now face an uncertain timeline for both economic and health recoveries

Those failures have left the health care system struggling to cope, plunged society into a well of uncertainty, and sent the economy cratering. Thanks to an inconsistent and often incoherent government response in the US, we now face an uncertain timeline for both economic and health recoveries. Twenty-six million people have filed unemployment claims.

And so some governors will call an end to stay-home orders in the hopes of resuscitating their economies. In Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of Tennessee, that time came on Friday. Other states, like California and New York, are taking a longer view, gradually easing some restrictions on movement while enforcing new requirements — masks on, low temps, can’t lose.

As cases decrease, restrictions will relax. But once we let our guard down, we’ll likely see resurgences of cases, once again straining health resources — leaving us with no choice but to close ourselves off again. That’s what’s happening in parts of China now, where new outbreaks of the same disease have emerged. The open-and-shut economy will likely continue as cases ebb and flow.

There are paths to victory, but as Ezra Klein notes at Vox, “these aren’t plans for returning to anything even approaching normal.” Victory over the virus will involve a lot of things that we don’t have yet. Scientific discoveries will help defeat the virus — but science can’t do it alone. Public policies will play a huge role, and even with firm health guidelines and speedy scientific developments, it will take longer than we want for us to truly eke out a win.

What does a win look like? It will take widespread tests of everyone who might be sick and careful quarantining of anyone who tests positive. It will take armies of contact tracers to trace down anyone who might have been exposed. These low-tech interventions are the best thing we’ve got while we give researchers the time they need to come up with other solutions.

Our brightest prospects — vaccines and treatments — are still in the minors

Scientists will labor over vaccines and treatments, but the overwhelming majority of their trials will turn up nothing useful. They’ll also keep trying to understand the virus and our bodies’ complicated response to it, in the hopes of developing legitimate antibody tests. Eventually, we may discover something that destroys the virus without wrecking our bodies. But none of that is ready today.

The end is still likely to be a long way away, as journalist Ed Yong writes in The Atlantic: “The pandemic is not a hurricane or a wildfire. It is not comparable to Pearl Harbor or 9/11. Such disasters are confined in time and space. The SARS-CoV-2 virus will linger through the year and across the world.”

Consider this a rebuilding year. It might even turn into rebuilding years, depending on our progress. Our brightest prospects — vaccines and treatments — are still in the minors. Even antibody testing isn’t ready to be called up to the big leagues, at least not yet.

This is a long game, and focusing on the victory celebrations — like New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio’s plan to “throw the biggest, best parade to honor” health care workers — won’t get us to the end.

If we focus on what victory looks like instead of what it takes to get us there, we’re going to keep being disappointed

If we focus on what victory looks like instead of what it takes to get us there, we’re going to keep being disappointed. We’ll feel defeated every time a drug fails in testing. We can’t let it get to us like that. The parades, the ballgames, the worship services that we’re looking forward to, those will be there once this is over. What we’ve got to ensure now is that when we get to reopening day — whenever it is — that our concert halls and stadiums and spiritual homes are filled with as many of our human siblings as we can possibly save.

It still sucks when the goalposts move from April 15th to April 30th, then to May 15th. It feels like we’re Charlie Brown and the end to this is a football that Lucy keeps pulling away. But when it comes to the virus itself, the clock isn’t the statistic that matters. These are the ones that do: numbers of tests, numbers of new infections, and numbers of bodies in the morgues.

When the numbers of tests go up and confirmed cases and deaths go down, then our playbook will change. But it won’t be the end of the fight — not yet.

We won’t be able to mark this finale in our calendars

We play this through to the end — there is no other option. Victory might look like a vaccine. It might look like a robust testing regime or a new treatment. It might look like us cobbling together a sense of normalcy and still watching for repeated outbreaks. Whatever form it takes, we’ll fight our way there with masks, thermometers, and soap, buying some time along the way. We’ll adjust our playbook as the virus adapts. We’ll position ourselves farther apart. We’ll do it again, and again when the next waves of this virus come. We will be exhausted when we get there, but we will get there. But if we don’t pace ourselves for the long haul, it will be that much harder to get through.

We won’t be able to mark this finale in our calendars. All we can do is get through today, pushing our leaders to get the people on the front lines the resources and time they need to get us through this. We need politicians who will stop telling us the comforting things we want to hear and start acting to keep as many of us alive as possible.

1040,1040,1236,"The CDC 'let the country down' with coronavirus testing, White House trade advisor Navarro says","White House Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director Peter Navarro speaks during a briefing on the coronavirus pandemic in the press briefing room of the White House on March 27, 2020 in Washington, DC.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""let the country down"" early in the nation's response to the Covid-19 crisis when it failed to scale diagnostic testing across the country, White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said on Sunday.

""Early on in this crisis the CDC, which really had the most trusted brand around the world in this space, really let the country down with the testing,"" Navarro told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""Not only did they keep the testing within the bureaucracy, they had a bad test, and that did set us back.""

When asked whether the White House still has confidence in the CDC to lead the country's response to the pandemic, Navarro said that ""you should ask the president that question, not me.""

In April, The Washington Post reported that the CDC's coronavirus testing kits were delayed due to ""a glaring scientific breakdown"" at the agency's central lab. The error was ""devastating to the country"" and ""really a terrible black mark on the CDC,"" James Le Duc, a former CDC officer, told The Post.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration later confirmed with CNBC that the ""CDC did not manufacture its test consistent with its own protocol,"" according to a spokeswoman. The agency ""was not able to determine from information provided by the CDC whether the test issues were due to a design or manufacturing issue,"" the spokeswoman said.

Speaking with CBS on Sunday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the CDC, which is an agency under HHS, has had to ""literally build this from the ground up"" and that it was the private sector's role to expand the CDC-developed test. He said the initial contaminated tests that the CDC developed prevented some of the scale up ""for a couple of weeks.""

In response to Navarro's comments, Azar said that he believes the CDC didn't let the country down and has always had the critical role of getting the private sector to the table.

""That was never going to be the backbone of testing, of broad, mass testing, in the United States,"" Azar told CBS, saying that was the role of companies like Abbott Laboratories, Roche and Thermo Fischer.

Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, a CNBC contributor who sits on the boards of Pfizer and biotech company Illumina, told CBS on Sunday that even if the CDC had rolled out its early test perfectly, there still wouldn't have been enough diagnostic testing in the nation.

Azar told CNN on Sunday that the U.S. is now conducting more than 300,000 tests per day and approximately 10 million tests total. Although that's still a small portion of the country's population of approximately 328 million people.

""What needed to happen was someone needed to pick up the phone and call the CEOs of LabCorp and Quest and the other big labs probably sometime in January or at least in early February,"" Gottlieb said. He said that person would've been either Azar or FDA Commissioner Stephan Hahn.

""If they'd ask the CEOs to do that, I'm willing to bet they would've done it and you would've got the big labs in the game,"" Gottlieb said.",1
892,892,1065,"FDA ""digging into"" data suggesting Abbott coronavirus test inaccuracies, but still recommends use, commissioner says","The Food and Drug Administration is ""digging into"" data that says a popular coronavirus test may give inaccurate results, Commissioner Stephen Hahn said. However, Hahn said the agency recommends that the Abbott Laboratory test, which is used to test President Donald Trump and White House staffers, still be available for use.

The FDA issued an emergency authorization in March for the Abbott ID NOW point-of-care test, which delivers results in minutes. The FDA published a warning about it on Thursday after an NYU Langone Health study, which has not been peer-reviewed, found that it might return false negatives — meaning it might say a person doesn't have the virus when they actually do.

""What we're saying is that there are some data to suggest that there may be inaccuracies, false negatives, with the Abbott test. However, there are many users who have contacted us and have not had this problem, so FDA is digging into it, and we're working with Abbott to actually look at what data are available to get the most up to date and accurate information about the test performance,"" Hahn said on ""CBS This Morning"" Friday. ""That being said, the test is on the market. We continue to recommend its use or to have it available for use.""

Hahn also noted that point-of-care tests in general ""would have a lower sensitivity than a test that's based in the laboratory.""

""We've known that for years,"" he said, but added that the data the FDA used to grant the emergency use authorization for the Abbott test ""were very robust.""

The purpose of the new FDA warning was to make sure providers have the information about what the test does.

""So for example, if a person you suspect — a doctor suspects a person has the disease, it might be worth, if the test is negative, getting a second confirmatory test. That's what our guidance is about,"" he said.

Hahn said the FDA is providing guidance to the White House about the test, but said it is up to them if they choose to keep using it. Mr. Trump has praised the test as ""ultra-fast"" and ""very accurate.""

Abbott said while some studies have shown the ""sensitivity performance percentages,"" or true positive rates, of the test to be in the 80s, others have shown it at or above 90%, and one showed it as high as 94%.

""We're seeing studies being conducted to understand the role of ID NOW in ways that it was not designed to be used. In particular, the NYU study results are not consistent with other studies,"" the statement said. ""While we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection, specimen type, collection, handling, storage, transport and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run. ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method.""

The company also said it will clarify its guidelines and continue ""to optimize"" the test.

Hahn also was asked about the testing capacity in the United States.

""We continue to work with close to 300 test developers. We have not taken our foot off the pedal with respect to this,"" he said. ""We recognize the need to get more tests on the market, and we're working with developers to do that.""

He said there are a number of factors contributing to delays in more tests, including the need for data before authorizing a test and an ""unprecedented demand for the tests.""

Hahn would not say if putting the onus on states to run testing and contact tracing was the best approach, but said, ""there are unique circumstances in the states.""

""The governors understand what best happens in the states, and we will provide them as much support as we possibly can to make the absolute best public health decisions,"" he said.",1
167,167,229,Lyft is offering free e-scooter trips to health care workers fighting COVID-19,"Lyft will provide free electric scooter rides to essential workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While most scooter-sharing programs in the US have temporarily ceased operations in response to the pandemic, Lyft is still operating scooters in a handful of cities, and the company wants to support the transportation needs of health care workers and others on the frontlines of the crisis.

Lyft is offering free scooter rides through April 30th, up to 30 minutes in length, for first-responders, health care employees, and transit workers in the following cities: Austin, Denver, Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Monica, and Washington, DC. Employers like hospitals, clinics, and transit agencies can email Lyft at heroscooters@lyft.com to obtain enrollment information that they can distribute to staff.

Lyft says it will prioritize scooter deployment near local hospitals for health care workers. The company is continuing to disinfect contact surfaces on scooters each time they are recharged, including handlebars, brake levers, bells, and throttles. The team is also disinfecting high contact surfaces on vans used to transport scooters at the start of each shift.

“Lyft scooters can play a unique role in providing essential transportation to critical workers.”

“Lyft scooters can play a unique role in providing essential transportation to critical workers on the frontlines against COVID-19,” said Caroline Samponaro, head of micromobility and transit policy at Lyft. “In a time of crisis, we know Lyft can be an essential lifeline, and we are proud to serve first-responders, transit, and healthcare providers as they serve the public.”

Previously, the ride-hailing company said it would provide free and discounted bike-share passes to essential workers in half a dozen cities. Free or cheap bike and scooter trips are especially useful as public transportation ridership continues to plummet in most cities and ride-sharing is not seen as a safe alternative. In fact, there has been a surge in cycling in New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago.

Of course, Lyft’s ride-sharing business has plummeted as health officials instruct people to avoid unnecessary travel. The company’s rides business has been cut in half in recent weeks, according to The Information. Lyft’s revenue after paying drivers is likely to be less than $150 million a month currently, down from about $260 million a month during the first quarter of last year, the publication reports. Lyft’s rival, Uber, has also seen a huge drop in demand and sales.

Both companies have come under fire for classifying drivers and delivery workers as independent contractors. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote a letter to gig companies calling on them to “reclassify your delivery workers as employees, rather than independent contractors, and ensure they are provided a full suite of employee protections and benefits.”",1
1365,1371,1892,"When even tough New Yorkers become petrified pandemic-shamers, it’s time to confront our over-anxiousness about Covid-19","By Diana Bruk , a Russian-American journalist living in New York, who has written for The New York Times, The Paris Review, Cosmopolitan, Esquire and Elle, amongst other publications.

The only thing to fear is fear itself… and coronavirus. Our response to this disease stems from a very Western form of privilege.

As someone who has been writing about social media movements for many years, I can tell you that they always follow the same formula. They start out with good intentions, then quickly devolve into a method of feeling superior by demonizing others. The Covid-19 pandemic has been no different.

Back in early March, it was useful to have people explain why carrying on with the St. Patrick’s Day parade in NYC – where I live – was very much a bad idea. The lockdown was necessary. We swallowed that bitter pill and all of the major repercussions that came with it. We certainly burdened but didn’t overwhelm the healthcare system. We limited the spread and flattened the curve.

But, now, many of those same people want more. They speak of second waves and how leaving your apartment will inevitably result in the death of their grandmother. They label anyone who is trying to make the best of the quarantine as “selfish” because we’re supposed to “all be in it together” in misery. They “pandemic shame”— a term used to describe those “Good Samaritans” who write vitriolic comments on photos of people reading in Central Park, or flat-out hurl a face mask at a friend of mine who was speaking on the phone outside of her building while yelling “Think of someone other than yourself!”

These people see themselves as self-righteous and heroic in a selfish world. But I personally believe that much of their behavior stems from anxiety, and that it shows a lack of self-awareness and selfishness to project that onto others and feel entitled to controlling their behavior.

“Like a lot of things that are fear-based, people don’t have any actual information, so these pandemic shamers are trying to regain a sense of control,” licensed psychologist Dr. Julie Davelman says. “So they tell themselves that if only everyone stays inside, we’ll be OK. Humans like to know what’s going to happen, and when we don’t have that, we make it up.”

To phrase it in the simple terms that Katherine, a Russian nurse living in Brooklyn, puts it, “People keep acting like we’d all live forever if it weren’t for the coronavirus. There are a lot of things that can kill you. The only thing that’s special about Covid-19, outside of the fact that it’s new, is that we’ve fixated on it.”

When I see people raging on social media about how no one should go out in case they touch a plant that someone who has Covid-19 might have touched, I feel the same way I imagine people must have felt when I used to tell them that it was extremely important that I check the oven several times before leaving the house, because, if I didn’t, the entire building might burn down, and I would have to live with the guilt of knowing that I not only killed my dog but hundreds of innocent people inside of it. Yes, all of this is true, just like it’s true that catching/passing on Covid-19 has a minor chance of being fatal.

But it’s also true that anything terrible can happen at any time, and, you’re not doing yourself any favors by living in fear of one specific thing that you’ve focused on. When you go to therapy for anxiety, one of the interesting things about it is that you aren’t taught to rationalize yourself into believing that you turned the oven off. You are encouraged to tell yourself that perhaps you left it on, and perhaps the worst will happen. It’s a free-fall, and it’s oddly liberating when you embrace it.

“Worrying isn’t actually an effective way of controlling problems, but we feel like it is, so we do it.” Davelmna says. “If worrying was an effective way of preventing something from happening, then nothing bad would happen, because at any given time, there’s at least one person worrying about every single thing. Because of that, people act as if worrying or protesting against someone else not worrying is a way of regaining control, which feels important because right now people feel very powerless.”

The thing that’s insidious about anxiety is that you worry so much about one specific thing that it ends up destroying other elements of your life. I worry about the oven, and end up being late to everything, which has consequences. The same could be said of how certain groups believe we should handle Covid-19. It’s reductive to make the argument that it’s about conservative versus liberal or that it’s about money versus saving lives. As Edelman put it, forcing people into a position in which they don’t know how they’re going to feed their children is not saving lives.

But I also find a lot of this pandemic-shaming to come from a very American type of privilege. As the NYT columnist Jennifer Weiner puts it, much of it seems to stem from “Coronavirus Karens.” For those not up on their internet lingo, a “Karen” is a term used to describe someone who is usually white, privileged, and middle-aged, and gets a power-high from telling a barista that they would like to “speak to the manager” because the foam on their latte wasn’t low-fat.

I see a lot of pandemic shaming coming from them toward ethnic groups like Russians who are still taking their kids on walks through parks, or Jews who are still gathering for Shabbat or minorities who grew up in neighborhoods with high crime rates.

I always think that they fail to recognize that this is the first time in a long time in American history when we’ve all had to collectively sit down and consider the fact that we’re all going to die someday. People who have had death hovering around them since they were young, on the other hand, would naturally feel like this is just another day in their life.

For what it’s worth, my experience is that confronting death comes in more or less three stages:

Stage One: Fear and panic. That's the natural and appropriate initial response.

Stage Two: An exploration of “what it all means” in light of this terrifying prospect. I think that's the stage most of us are in now.

Stage Three: You accept the fact that, no matter what you do, you really can't control how and when you die, but you have a lot of control over how you live, and as such, choose to try to live life to the fullest regardless of your personal circumstances. This is a very good stage and it lasts.

I’m not suggesting that we don’t take precautions. We absolutely should. It’s a good idea to wear a face mask when we go outside, just as it’s a good idea to make sure nothing is on fire before we leave the apartment. But I do think that anything past that is built on fear, and fear-based decisions are never good ones.

439,439,541,FDA authorizes experimental drug remdesivir for emergency use in COVID-19 patients,"The Food and Drug Administration just authorized the emergency use of remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug, to treat COVID-19.

Emergency authorization does not mean that the drug is FDA-approved, a standard that only comes after a detailed review showing that a drug can safely and effectively treat a particular disease. The agency can issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) for unapproved medical products that may help treat a life-threatening disease when no approved alternatives are available, and that’s what it did here.

We need final data from clinical trials included in an FDA application to determine whether remdesivir is safe and effective in treating or preventing #COVID19. — Dr. Janet Woodcock (@DrWoodcockFDA) May 1, 2020

The authorization does not mean the drug was proven to work by the FDA’s usual benchmarks but that “the known and potential benefits of remdesivir when used to treat COVID-19 outweigh the known and potential risks of such products,” according to the agency’s authorization letter.

Under the authorization, the drug can be used to treat patients who are hospitalized with a severe enough case of the disease that they need to be given supplemental oxygen or placed on a ventilator.

Pharmaceutical company Gilead, which makes remdesivir, previously announced that it plans to give away its entire existing supply of the drug — enough to treat over 140,000 patients. Gilead said in a press release that the US government will be in charge of distributing remdesivir to hospitals, but it is still unclear when the company will start to ship the drug under the new authorization.

Research showing that remdesivir blocks the activity of the novel coronavirus in cells made it a leading candidate to treat it. Gilead originally developed the drug to treat Ebola. Prior to this authorization, doctors could treat COVID-19 patients with remdesivir by enrolling them in clinical trials or making individual requests to the drug company under the FDA’s compassionate use policy.

Data from clinical trials of the drug has been mixed. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said this week that patients in its study who were treated with remdesivir recovered from COVID-19 four days faster than patients who were given a placebo. Eight percent of the group given the drug died, compared to 11 percent of the placebo group. The NIAID said it will release more detailed data on the study, which included over 1,000 patients, later on, leaving the findings difficult to critically analyze at this point.

Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID, called the results “good news.” “What it has proven is a drug can block this virus,” he said in the White House this week. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb had a more reserved take on the results. “Evolutionary, not revolutionary,” he tweeted.

Good, succinct take by @CarlosdelRio7. Evolutionary, not revolutionary. Remdesivir appears active, may help some patients. A beginning. We’ll need better drugs and ultimately a vaccine. But this could help if used appropriately, especially if we also have antibody drugs by Fall. https://t.co/gUt7M6AGpt — Scott Gottlieb, MD (@ScottGottliebMD) April 29, 2020

However, a Chinese study also published the same day found that patients given the drug did not improve more quickly than patients who were treated with a placebo. “Unfortunately, our trial found that while safe and adequately tolerated, remdesivir did not provide significant benefits over placebo,” the lead investigator of the study, Bin Cao of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University in Beijing, told The New York Times.

Testing drugs is hard under normal circumstances and even more challenging during an active pandemic. The novel coronavirus is killing thousands of people every day, and people all around the world are desperate for answers — putting tremendous pressure on any new data and inflating any positive signal. No drug has proven to be a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19, and research into remdesivir and other treatment candidates continues.",1
834,834,1003,Texas has relaxed its coronavirus restrictions even as new infections are on the rise,"Two weeks into the reopening of Texas, coronavirus cases continue to climb — along with tensions.

Shops, restaurants, nail salons, cinemas, barbershops, tanning salons, and beaches in Texas are open to the public.

On Monday, gyms, offices, and nonessential manufacturing facilities will be added to the list.

Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to announce additional plans for reopening gyms and childcare facilities.

Some in Texas feel that they don't have a choice, from a financial standpoint, but to resume business.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Less than two weeks after its stay-at-home order expired, Texas has reported its largest daily increase in new coronavirus cases and deaths.

Coronavirus-related deaths hit a low of 12 on Tuesday, but by Thursday, the state saw 58 new deaths and 1,448 new cases.

Texas is one of a handful of states that have begun easing coronavirus restrictions: Shops, restaurants, nail salons, movie theaters, barbershops, tanning salons, churches, and beaches are open to the public. People are still encouraged to maintain social distance, wear face masks, and wash their hands frequently.

Gov. Greg Abbott has defended the fast clip at which the state is resuming business, saying its death and hospitalization rates are lower than in other states of similar size, such as Florida and California, The Associated Press reported. Texas had 44,485 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,235 deaths as of Friday.

So far, Texas has conducted 623,284 coronavirus tests, which is about on par with Florida's testing but lower than California's 1.1 million tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project.

Abbott's goal is to open Texas fully.

Gyms, offices, and nonessential manufacturing facilities are slated to open on Monday, but social distancing is still required, and none of them can exceed 25% of their maximum capacity. At gyms, showers and locker areas will be off-limits, equipment must be sanitized after each use, and gloves are mandatory.

Abbott is expected on Monday to announce when and how bars and childcare facilities can resume business.

In Austin, restaurant owners have been tasked with maintaining logs of customers to help with contact tracing if needed. They also know that health officials might call them out in the case of an outbreak, The AP reported.

Eric Silverstein, who owns The Peached Tortilla, said he and others in the restaurant industry should be willing to do whatever it takes to open back up.

""We have no choice,"" he told The AP. ""You kind of have to go back to doing some form of business.""

But not everyone shared the sentiment.

Suzanne Daniels, who owns the Brentwood Social House, told The AP that she wasn't trying to compete with restaurants that are offering indoor seating. She doesn't know when she'll feel safe enough to do so, she added.

""It feels early,"" Daniels said. ""In my gut, it doesn't feel right or good.""

Other states, including Wisconsin and Georgia, have also relaxed restrictions, though Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease expert, warned Congress of ""needless suffering and death"" if the US reopens prematurely.

The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center projected that Dallas County could experience an uptick of 800 new cases every day by early July if containment measures are flouted, The Dallas Morning News reported.

Texas is also experiencing friction between state and local authorities. Attorney General Ken Paxton censured officials in Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio for enforcing restrictions that are stricter than what Abbott has implemented statewide for Texas. The cities have been threatened with lawsuits if they don't ease up, The AP reported.

""Unfortunately, a few Texas counties and cities seem to have confused recommendations with requirements and have grossly exceeded state law to impose their own will on private citizens and businesses,"" Paxton told The AP.

In El Paso, county judge Ricardo Samaniego requested that Abbott wait until the number of cases are declining and closely consider data before further lifting restrictions. He's still awaiting a reply, according to The AP, but doesn't expect it to come before Monday's announcement.

""I'm not fighting his plan; I'm fighting his timing,"" Samaniego told The AP. ""It looks like it would work for us months from now.""

Abbott, for his part, points to the fact that overflow hospitals in Dallas and Houston were never used. That's an indicator that Texas' healthcare system wasn't overwhelmed, he said.

The results of Texas' reopening — and the effects in other states — aren't yet fully known, since the coronavirus has a lag time, Fauci said in April.

New cases and hospitalizations reported today are a reflection of the coronavirus' spread two weeks ago because the average incubation period is five days, and symptoms worsen over a week or two. Then after a person gets tested, it takes a few days for results to come back, which then must be reported to local and state health authorities. If someone is hospitalized, it may take many more days before they get dangerously sick or die.

That's why the White House guidelines advise states to see a 14-day ""downward trajectory"" in cases before they reopen, The New York Times reported.

If a state's new infections aren't dropping, it could still start reopening as long as the proportion of test results that come back positive is lower than it was two weeks ago (assuming as many or more tests are administered).

""They see the decline going in, and they pat themselves on the back and say, 'Look at the good work we've done. Now we can let this happen and open up things,'"" Dennis Perrotta, a retired state epidemiologist in Texas, told The AP. ""And then we get slammed with a second peak.""

115,115,163,Some Tesla factory employees still had to work after the production shutdown,"Local officials have confirmed that Tesla stopped making electric cars in California on Monday, March 23rd, in compliance with a shelter-in-place order brought on by the novel coronavirus pandemic. But dozens of workers had to report to the company’s automotive factory to finish processing the final batches of cars this week, according to an email to some of those workers obtained by The Verge and the account of one of the factory’s employees.

This comes as Tesla confirmed the first two cases of COVID-19 among its office workforce on Thursday, according to another email that was viewed by The Verge after it was first reported by Business Insider and Electrek. Tesla is also making its first workforce cuts during the pandemic, temporarily laying off some employees in Norway, an electric vehicle stronghold.

The email to factory employees, sent ahead of the production shutdown, informed some of these “end of line” workers that they’d have to keep reporting to the automotive plant to run quality checks, make fixes, and charge and prep the cars for delivery. Tesla management, they were told, essentially wanted all departments that work on a car after it comes off the production line to keep reporting to the factory until the cars were out for delivery. The current employee, who was granted anonymity because they feared retribution, confirmed many of these workers reported to the factory throughout this week.

The local police department says Tesla is complying with the shelter-in-place order

A spokesperson for the local police department told The Verge that it “conducted a visit and inspected Tesla [on Wednesday] and found their current level of operation to be in compliance” with the shelter-in-place order. “Their vehicle assembly line has stopped and they have only a small number of employees in the factory. They have also gone to great lengths to implement social distancing measures,” they said.

Factory workers were also told in the email that they wouldn’t receive the paid leave Tesla has promised until their own departments finally shut down. Any workers who did not feel well or felt uncomfortable coming to work were encouraged to use accrued paid time off or take unpaid leave, which was the company’s guidance before the shutdown was announced last week.

The current factory worker said Tesla’s end of line process usually takes a few hours for a car with “moderate issues.” But they also said the company finished production on Monday with an increased number of cars considered to be “work in progress,” which, therefore, required more end of line work.

Cars coming off the production lines of legacy automakers usually complete end of line checks in a matter of minutes, according to Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research. Tesla did not respond to questions about the end of line workers or the employees who tested positive for COVID-19.

Tesla had kept the Fremont, California factory open last week, even after the shelter-in-place order took effect in the San Francisco Bay Area on March 17th. The company had just started delivering the Model Y, its fifth electric car, and was in the middle of a typical end-of-quarter push to make and deliver as many cars as possible.

Tesla had just started delivering the Model Y as the pandemic gripped the US

At the same time that CEO Elon Musk was underplaying the threat of the coronavirus, almost every other major automaker suspended production operations in the United States following a deal between Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, and the United Auto Workers union. Tesla, which is the biggest automaker in the US without a unionized workforce, did tell some of its white-collar workers to work remotely if possible last week while the factory remained open.

The company ultimately announced on March 19th that it would comply with the Bay Area order and shut down operations at the California factory where the Model 3, Model S, Model X, and now the Model Y are assembled, and it agreed to reduce the workforce there to “basic operations” like processing payroll. Tesla announced that same day that it would also pause operations at its solar panel factory in New York, but that the Gigafactory in Nevada would keep operating, despite the governor asking all nonessential businesses to close.

It’s currently unclear which office the two infected Tesla employees work in. Laurie Shelby, who runs Tesla’s environmental, health, and safety division, said in the email that the two employees “had been working from home for nearly two weeks” before they tested positive for COVID-19. Shelby said the employees did not show symptoms of the disease while they were in the office and that their “direct coworkers, who were already working from home for nearly two weeks as well, were immediately notified so they can quarantine and watch for symptoms.” Both employees are “quarantined at home and recovering well,” Shelby wrote.

Tesla briefly shut down its newest factory in China earlier this year as part of a government-mandated effort to suppress the spread of the virus. But Musk tweeted on Wednesday that he plans to reopen the New York factory “as soon as humanly possible” as Tesla joins in the effort to help increase the production of ventilators, which are crucial to treating the worst symptoms of COVID-19.",1
1142,1142,1404,Transportation secretary: Airlines must be fair to people hit by coronavirus disruptions,"Elaine L. Chao

Opinion Contributor

During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the U.S. Department of Transportation is focused on keeping our country’s national airspace operational and safe. That includes protecting consumers, the aviation workforce, and the economic health of the airlines.

As Secretary of Transportation, I’m especially concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on airline passengers, many of whom may be facing financial uncertainty. So the department is closely monitoring airline practices regarding refunds, especially for reasons that are beyond the control of passengers. In fact, last week we announced additional steps to further protect consumers and make it easier for airlines to help boost the economic recovery.

As the Treasury Departmentcontinues to disburse $50 billion in support to the nation’s passenger airlines to protect their workers, the Department of Transportation has made it clear that cancellation and refund requirements are still in effect. In fact, they are more important than ever. Providing refunds is a long-standing practice when air travel has been disrupted on a large scale such as after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, and presidentially-declared natural disasters. DOT continues to emphasize the importance of refunds today.

Passengers deserve refunds

On April 3, 2020, DOT issued an Enforcement Notice reminding airlines that the law requires them to offer passengers prompt refunds for flights that are canceled or significantly delayed by the airline. Last week the department also issued an additional enforcement notice clarifying the obligations airlines have to paying customers, such as the definition of a “prompt” refund.

Meanwhile, DOT has received an unprecedented volume of complaints from passengers seeking refunds and is examining this issue closely to ensure that airlines’ policies and practices conform to its refund rules. The department will also examine any instances where an airline may have misled its passengers about the status of a flight in order to avoid having to offer ticket refunds.

Former Transportation secretary:Amid coronavirus collapse, airlines and the 10 million jobs they support need a lifeline

Many Americans, who canceled their reservations based on COVID-19 health concerns, are seeking refunds for the non-refundable tickets they purchased but could not use. After the president declared a national emergency on March 13 and states directed people to stay at home, it’s understandable that many people who had previously booked tickets for travel during the spring and summer months would have no choice but to cancel those bookings. They deserve fair treatment.

Voucher or credit may not be enough

Some airlines have issued credits that last several months or years, which is acceptable for some passengers. But to passengers who are pressed for money because of COVID-19, a voucher or credit may not be adequate. Only a handful of airlines have begun fully refunding these passengers. I am asking all airlines to reconsider their customer service policies, so that these policies are as flexible and considerate as possible to the needs of passengers. That’s so important for travelers who are facing financial hardship during this unprecedented time.

Sheryl Sandberg:Our new small business report shows scope of COVID struggles and optimism

Since the April 3 enforcement notice, some carriers have significantly improved their refund and credit policies. That is encouraging. Others should follow suit. Additionally, it’s important for our country’s economic recovery that the airlines continue maximum service to destinations all over America. The department has also taken steps to ensure this.

As always, the department’s commitment to the traveling public is at the forefront of everything we do.

1144,1144,1406,Live updates: 15-year-old dies after testing positive as toll hits five-day high; Md. reports spike in infections after testing surge,"One of the largest fitness companies in the District is mobilizing its 15,000 members to push the mayor’s office to allow gyms to reopen in the first phase of recovery.

In a Monday email, Vida Fitness urged members to email and call the mayor’s office to urge that gyms be among the first nonessential businesses allowed to resume operations. Officials suggested members tout the importance of exercise for a healthy immune system.

“We believe we have the means and methods to protect our members and our employees uniquely and more effectively than almost any other retail establishment out there,” David von Storch, president and founder of Vida’s parent company, said in an interview.

He said his facilities would reopen with a host of social distancing measures, with visits scheduled by appointment, temperature checks upon entry and face masks required. He also added that the gyms could assist city officials with contact tracing by providing names and contact information for anyone who may have come into contact with infected members.

The advocacy comes as an advisory group on reopening the District formed by the mayor is set to issue recommendations this week. With the District on track to meet metrics to lift social distancing measures, the mayor said she may have a reopening date Thursday, when she will update residents on the advisory group’s recommendations.

The current restrictions are set to expire June 8. A spokeswoman for the mayor declined to comment ahead of the Thursday briefing.

Von Storch has been in touch with the leaders of a committee focused on open spaces and recreation but got a cool reception.

Tommy Wells, director of the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment and co-chair of the recreation committee, said in a Monday email that fitness gyms will not be included in a Phase 1 opening.

“Outdoor programming with low intensity activities will be first,” Wells told Von Storch. “Let me assure you, if our committee had place[d] gyms in the first phase, it would have been removed by the chairs above us.”

Von Storch said the city needs to provide more flexibility to struggling businesses depending on their ability to impose social distancing measures.",1

On Wednesday, Russia recorded its first day of more Covid-19 recoveries than new cases, and the prime minister now believes Russia has hit its peak.

According to official statistics published by the Russian government, 9,262 Covid-19 patients beat the virus in the last 24 hours, and 8,764 people were diagnosed. The latest daily number of recoveries is the highest on record, and the tally of newly confirmed cases represents the lowest increase since May 1.

The latest numbers are a positive trend, and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin believes that Russia is reaching the peak of the burden placed on its healthcare system by the virus.

“The situation is gradually stabilizing, especially in Moscow, which was the first to face a new infection,” he said.

According to the prime minister, it is now possible for some parts of the country to start removing restrictive measures. Thus far, 14 of Russia’s 85 regions have already begun to ease restrictions.

“All relevant services and authorities in the regions must constantly keep the situation under control and prevent its deterioration, so that if necessary, they can respond immediately,” he explained.

Despite figures moving in the right direction, the situation might not be all rosy. On Wednesday, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin declared that he expects the death rate in May to be higher than in April.

“There are seriously ill people in hospitals, including in intensive care, for two to three weeks. On the one hand, this accumulating volume creates a great burden on the health system, and on the other hand [it] generates a high mortality rate, which will be significantly higher in May than in April,” he said.

In total, 308,705 cases of Covid-19 have been detected in Russia, with 85,392 patients recovering and 2,972 passing away. 1,726 (58%) of those deaths were in Moscow.

498,498,614,Trump pick to oversee rescue spending pledges impartiality,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s choice to oversee a significant chunk of the $2 trillion economic rescue law is pledging to conduct audits and investigations “with fairness and impartiality.’’

Brian Miller, a lawyer in the White House counsel’s office, goes before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday for his nomination as special inspector general for pandemic recovery. The post would place him in charge of overseeing a roughly $500 billion Treasury fund for industry created as part of the economic rescue law approved in late March.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

In prepared testimony, Miller pledged to be vigilant in protecting the integrity and independence of his office and vowed “to seek the truth in all matters that come before me and to use my authority and resources to uncover fraud, waste and abuse.’’

Miller has worked at the Justice Department and was inspector general for nearly a decade at the General Services Administration, which oversees thousands of federal contracts. While he is respected in the oversight community, Miller’s role in the White House counsel’s office — which led Trump’s defense during impeachment — is troubling, Democrats and watchdog groups said.

Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, top Democrat on the banking panel, said he questions whether Miller will be able to hold the Trump administration accountable for how it administers the business program and “guarantee that corporations getting taxpayer money put their workers first.″

“Mr. Miller will be called upon to answer how he will ensure he is independent and will hold the administration accountable,’’ Brown said in a statement.

Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said Miller’s nomination is part of a pattern of “roadblocks thrown up” by Trump to block oversight of his administration.

In recent weeks, Trump has fired an inspector general tied to his impeachment and sidelined another who was set to lead a group of inspectors general overseeing the rescue package. On Friday night, Trump moved to replace yet another inspector general, an acting official who criticized the coronavirus response by federal health officials.

Trump also said in signing the rescue law that he will resist oversight provisions.

“All of this taken together means real oversight will be met with retribution, which makes it all the more important,’’ Bookbinder said.",1
764,764,933,"Air travel won't return to pre-crisis levels until 2023, IATA chief warns","The impact on air travel from the coronavirus will be felt for many years to come, according to the International Air Transport Association, which estimates that passenger traffic won't rebound to pre-crisis levels until at least 2023. The trade association for the world's airlines said that demand for air travel had dropped more than 90% in Europe and the U.S. since the start of the pandemic, and warned that recovery will be even slower if lockdowns and travel restrictions are extended. ""We are asking governments to have a phased approach to restart the industry and to fly again,"" Alexandre de Juniac, the IATA's director general and CEO, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday. De Juniac is hopeful that some flying will resume by the summer. ""We are aiming at reopening and boosting the domestic market by end of the second quarter, and opening the regional or continental markets — such as Europe, North America or Asia-Pacific — by the third quarter, and intercontinental in the fall,"" he said. ""So for summer we hope that you will see flights within Europe coming back, with I hope interesting prices and very safe processes of control."" The European Union's external borders remain closed to non-EU nationals until mid-June. The European Commission has recommended a phased approach for its member states to reopen borders that would start with countries with low levels of coronavirus infections.

The comments from the IATA com as travel groups are desperate to bring operations back to life and some are already rolling out plans to do so. United Airlines has expressed its aims to schedule Europe and China routes in June, Dubai's flagship Emirates Airline will recommence nine outbound routes starting May 21 and European low-cost carrier Ryanair expects to have 40% of its flights running by July 1. Budget carrier Wizz Air will restart routes from London's Luton Airport starting June 16, Lufthansa is planning service expansion in June and IAG will resume some flights in July, among others.

Mandatory quarantine 'useless'

But any hopes for a boost to the industry with some resumed travel will be dashed if governments institute mandatory 14-day quarantine periods for travelers upon arrival, de Juniac warned. ""We are advocating with governments not to implement quarantine measures that will retain people for two weeks that will arrive anywhere,"" he said. ""We think that it is useless provided we have implemented the health and sanitary controls that we are discussing with governments. It is absolutely key for the tourist industry which is so important for so many countries in Europe."" Scores of countries including Australia, New Zealand, China, Spain and potentially the U.K. are requiring international travelers to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival, with varying degrees of enforcement: in Australia, arrivals are escorted to a hotel where they must remain for 14 days, while in other countries they are expected to ""self-quarantine"" at home. Hong Kong issued state-monitored tracking bracelets that arrivals must wear to ensure they do not leave their area of quarantine. Such policies will no doubt deter many people from wanting to travel. De Juniac believes quarantine periods are simply not necessary as long as airlines and airports uphold stringent sanitation and monitoring practices. ""Is it possible to have an aircraft full and without risk of contamination? Our answer is yes,"" de Juniac said, ""provided we implement control and sanitary processes for passengers just before the flight — by asking for temperature control, by the obligation to wear a mask, by cleaning the aircraft properly and disinfecting properly, by limiting the distribution of food to prepackaged food, by limiting cabin luggage to one luggage to avoid disembarking and embarking process to be too overcrowded."" With such a multilayered approach, he argued, ""you limit the risk of contamination. ... And then the quarantine is not useful from our point of view in this case.""

442,442,547,"Chicago outdoors & coronavirus: Heidecke, Silver Springs, North Point, Illinois Beach SP, Hennepin-Hopper","It’s been a bizarre month and a half since the Illinois Department of Natural Resources closed all its sites on the afternoon of March 15. It became even more bizarre today when many IDNR sites eopened on a limited basis.

I mean many, as in many more than originally posted as reopening.

(At the bottom, I also have an update, which I learned late today, on Hennepin-Hopper lakes at Dixon Waterfowl Refuge, one of my favorite spots in Illinois.)

As bizarre as the situation was with northeastern Illinois sites, it was nothing compared to the massive changes that went on with reopenings in southern Illinois. Click here for the latest lists of what was or is supposed to be reopened across Illinois.

The most bizarre part of today may be Heidecke Lake, the former cooling lake near Morris. It was literally decided to reopen it today, because it is part of Goose Lake Prairie. I briefly considered heading out there when I found out, but instead stuck with the reopening of Kankakee River State Park.

The other bizarre part is the state of North Point Marina. It’s listed as officially closed, but, for all practical purposes, appears to be functioning as if open. I am still trying to sort that one out officially and unofficially.

Not sure when this happened, but Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area reopened on Friday, a much needed opening to ease pressure on other sites. (Rock Cut SP also unexpectedly is listed as reopened.)

Unrelated to the coronavirus, Illinois Beach SP did not reopen today because of flooding and storm damage.

Now, to Hennepin-Hopper lakes at Dixon Waterfowl Refuge near Hennepin. Paul Botts, president and executive director of The Wetlands Initiative, called and emailed late this afternoon with an update on what is happening with an experimental three-day access trial in mid-May.

In a follow-up phone call, he indicated rather certainly that he expects fishing to come back this year, but obviously that depends on lots of things.

Here is the email update:

On Tuesday, May 19 through Thursday, May 21, the Dixon Waterfowl Refuge will be open to visitors from dawn to dusk for a trial run of public access during the COVID-19 epidemic. We’re glad so many people treasure and enjoy this special place. Thank you for your understanding as we navigate this unusual and unprecedented time. Only the trails will be open on these days. The lakes will remain closed to paddling and fishing at this time. Please practice social distancing and stay at least 6 feet away from other people including TWI staff doing restoration and stewardship work. Of course the standard rules for visiting, which are posted at the Refuge, also still apply. As always, parking is allowed only in the official lots. If all parking spaces are filled, please visit the Refuge at another time. No portable toilets will be available so plan your visit accordingly. If all goes well during the three-day trial run and it’s clear that we can protect the health of both visitors and staff, we aim to keep public access moving forward into the summer. We’re hoping that everyone together can make this possible!

I sure hope it opens up. It is one of the great fishing spots in Illinois, but I love it even more just for the audacity of its concept and execution as a restoration project. If I am in the area, I climb the tower to check out the site or do some hiking.",1

A yellowish-gray substance wrapped in a chilled tortilla with a side of mashed strawberries and blueberries arrived around noon on Monday.

“Surprise, Daddy! We brought you lunch,” said Matteo, my 2-year-old, beaming along with his older brother, Lucca, in the doorway to my makeshift home office.

My wife had given our children strict instructions not to disturb Daddy, and, mostly, they had complied. Sure, there were the occasional high-pitched shrieks and the wallop of what sounded like the armoire tipping over and slamming onto the ceiling above me — not to mention the “Ont some waffles!” cry from Matteo every couple of hours or so.

But after heapings of coronavirus gloom from the morning news, my children’s scrambled egg offering brought more comfort than a plate of my favorite spaghetti carbonara.

I’ve never worked from home before. I’m on Day 3 and can’t imagine this isolation lasting for another two, three, four — goodness knows how many more weeks.

But we can’t really shut out the outside world. Beside the barrage of bad news — including mounting coronavirus cases in Italy, my father’s home — my wife and I worry that Matteo, who is asthmatic, might need a trip to the emergency room, as he has a dozen or so times since his birth. I’m not a particularly religious man, but I’ve prayed about that in recent days.

But like everyone else, we are adjusting to this new reality.

I’m struck by how quiet it is in the mornings — before my children awaken. Quiet enough to hear chattering sparrows and the bird song that cuts through all of that, the whit-choo, whit-choo, whit-choo! of the northern Cardinal. Signs, too, that spring is not so far off.

This morning, we were greeted by the smiling, bearded face of “Mr. Muhammad,” Matteo’s Montessori music teacher, who could be seen on my phone strumming his guitar all alone in the school’s music room. Typically, he’s accompanied by a dozen or so bouncing toddlers, including Matteo. The day before, he’d offered a yoga class as a way to help all of us to calm down a little bit.

“Can I listen to Mr. Hammad?” Matteo said, noticing the video on my phone.

Then, not fully grasping the reality of the situation, he said, “Where’s Matteo? Where’s Logan?”

Mr. Muhammad is nothing short of a rock star in our family — a guy who will only become more revered as this thing drags on.

It’s been harder to gauge how Lucca, my 8-year-old, is doing. Not long ago, he declared, “Children are dying from the coronavirus.”

He has stopped talking about the disease in recent days. And when I sat him down and asked if he’s still worried, he assured me that he isn’t.

But it’s hard to say what’s going on in that Pokemon-obsessed head of his. At times, he’s refused to sleep in the bunk bed he’d begged us for months to buy. The other day, I found him curled up asleep on the floor in his bedroom. And Lucca, like Matteo, is more insistent than ever that I read him a bedtime story every night.

On Tuesday, Lucca brought me “lunch” — two pieces of bread that appeared to have leaped out of the toaster in fear of being browned. Lucca had smeared peanut butter on one slice and made a strawberry jam smiley face on the other.

To cool the cabin fever, I announced we were going to have a backyard baseball game on my lunch break — never mind that Dad, who grew up in England, doesn’t actually know the rules of baseball. About 10 minutes later, Matteo arrived at my office door in a shirt and, from the waist down, nothing but his birthday suit.

“I want to go out and play baseball!” he shouted.

His mother, with one arched eyebrow, followed close behind holding a diaper and questioning the timing of my announcement.

“Daddy shouldn’t have brought it up now,” she said.

So we are all adjusting. What choice do we have?

386,386,478,Tesla pauses plan to bring back workers as Bay Area extends stay-at-home order,"Over the weekend, Tesla told some of its employees in California to get ready to return to work this week. But by Monday, the company reversed course and told those employees to stay at home. Now, it faces the possibility that its electric car factory will have to remain closed for longer than previously anticipated as public health officials say they will extend the stay-at-home orders in the San Francisco Bay Area through much of May.

Tesla told employees in early April that it hoped to bring them back on May 4th — a goal that was communicated in the same internal email where Tesla announced company-wide pay cuts and the placement of hundreds of workers on unpaid leave.

It’s not currently clear if the leaders of the six Bay Area counties will relax some parts of their orders, as a few states have started to do, and more details are expected later this week. The counties were the first in the country to issue a formal stay-at-home order when they announced it on March 16th. San Francisco mayor London Breed said she expects “some lower-risk activities to be allowed to resume,” but urged residents that the goal is to “build on the progress we’ve made.”

More details are expected from officials later this week

Tesla’s quick about-face caused some whiplash among its factory line workers, according to one who spoke with The Verge on the condition of anonymity because the furloughed employees weren’t expecting to be called back so soon. “Why would they furlough us for only a couple weeks? They wouldn’t, they expect this to [last] longer,” this person said last month. But when the company sent out the first emails this past weekend about coming back, this person said “I was getting frantic texts from people I know on the line who were being told they are starting back on Monday.”

Not going back to work, they said, is a relief for some of the workers — even the ones on unpaid leave. “We all have the same mindset, and it’s this: COVID-19 has not hit its peak in the area where we work or the areas where we live, so everyone is still at risk,” this person said. “Putting us back into an environment to which we could not social distance such as the production line or the shuttles would be a huge mistake and cause for our workplace to be hugely compromised as well as the towns we go back to.”

Tesla initially resisted the stay-at-home order and was one of the last automakers in the US to suspend operations. The company told local officials (and employees) that it had been deemed “national critical infrastructure” by the Department of Homeland Security and that the California factory should therefore remain open. This sparked a back-and-forth between the Tesla and the local sheriff’s office and health department about whether the company’s car manufacturing plant was an “essential business” or causing a “public health risk.”

The company eventually relented and announced it would close down the plant on March 23rd, though it continued to fight to keep its operations going right up until that date. A number of workers also had to report to the factory during the week following the shutdown to finish working on cars Tesla ultimately delivered as part of the company’s typical end-of-quarter push. (Tesla also halted most operations at its solar panel factory in New York and at the original Gigafactory in Nevada before announcing the salary cuts and furloughs.)

That push, combined with the launch of the Model Y and early success with the newly opened Gigafactory in China, helped Tesla beat expectations for its first quarter delivery and production figures despite the pandemic. What that means for the company’s bottom line will be revealed when Tesla announces its first quarter financial results on Wednesday.",1
527,527,648,Pitchfork 2020 canceled due to COVID-19,"Pitchfork Music Festival 2020 has been canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic, officials announced Wednesday.

“It can be pretty daunting to think about the future of live music right now, but know that we are fully committed to bringing Pitchfork Music Festival back in 2021, if the public health situation allows for it,” officials wrote in a statement announcing the cancellation.

“In the meantime, we urge everyone to follow local health department guidelines. We are in this together, and, if we all do our part, we’ll celebrate next year in person.”

1283,1285,1697,Here are the Chinese ‘propaganda’ centers currently operating in the US,"(Natural News) Dozens of Chinese “propaganda” centers still operate across the United States, even as U.S. lawmakers debate how to hold the communist country accountable for withholding information about the coronavirus, which originated in China’s Wuhan province.

(Article by Jon Street republished from CampusReform.org)

For years,Â Campus ReformÂ has reported on the number of Confucius Institutes on U.S. college campuses. Funded by the communist regime, these centers are marketed as Chinese language and culture centers. However, U.S. intelligence officials have warned that these centers are little more than “propaganda” arms of the communist country.

The radical left will stop at nothing to intimidate conservative students on college campuses. You can help expose them.Â Find out more Â»

Even the former Chinese propaganda minister, Â Liu Yushan, wrote in a 2010 article for Chinese-state media, âWith regard to key issues that influence our sovereignty and safety, we should actively carry out international propaganda battles against issuers such as Tibet, Xinjiang, Taiwan, human rights and Falun Gong. â¦ We should do well in establishing and operating overseas cultural centers and Confucius Institutes,”Â PoliticoÂ reported in 2018.

While China and the U.S. disagree on most things, this appears to be one area in which officials from both countries share opinions.

FBI Director Christopher Wray said during a 2018 congressional hearing when asked about Confucius Institutes on college campuses, âThe level of naÃ¯vetÃ© on the part of the academic sector about this creates its own issues. Theyâre exploiting the very open research and development environment that we have, which we all revere. But theyâre taking advantage of it.â

CIA reports obtained byÂ The Washington Free BeaconÂ further revealed, “The [Chinese Communist Party] provides âstrings-attached’ funding to academic institutions and think tanks to deter research that casts it in a negative light. It has used this tactic to reward pro-China viewpoints and coerce Western academic publications and conferences to self-censor. The CCP often denies visas to academics who criticize the regime, encouraging many China scholars to preemptively self-censor so they can maintain access to the country on which their research depends.”

While legislation signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2018 resulted in about a dozen U.S. colleges shuttering Confucius Institutes on campus, those closures were largely the result of their loss of funding, rather than concerns for the country’s national security.

And now, nearly two years after that legislation became law, more than 75 Confucius Institutes are still in operation in the U.S., most of them on college campuses. From Maine to Florida to Kansas to California, these centers claim to educate American students about Chinese language and culture, and administrators who run the campuses on which they operate appear to believe the same country that claims to have fewer coronavirus deaths than the U.S, despite its population being more than three times the size of the U.S. population.

Based on data from theÂ National Association of Scholars,Â along with records maintained byÂ Campus Reform, the interactive map below shows the locations where Confucius Institutes still operate. Hover your cursor over each dot to reveal the name of each college or school that currently hosts one of these centers.

636,636,776,"Pritzker offers ‘disheartening’ news: COVID-19 deaths could range from 50 to 300 a day, possibly into July","Illinois’ peak period of COVID-19 deaths could stretch into early June – or possibly even July.

And that could mean 50 to 150 Illinoisans losing their lives to the coronavirus a day – or possibly as many as 300 each day.

Those were some of the grim estimates Gov. J.B. Pritzker delivered from his own home on Monday, a mix of troubling projections coupled with a few optimistic signs of progress for parts of the state outside the Chicago area.

The daily death toll Monday was 54, at the low end of the projections for the peak period. But that follows an especially deadly week, and it was announced amid a new round of scientific modeling.

And those dire projections come at an extremely inopportune time for the Democratic governor, who is facing criticism from Republican legislators, unemployed workers who appear stuck in limbo and President Donald Trump.

It also comes as many in Illinois are suffering from cabin fever, growing increasingly restless over their lives having been disrupted for more than eight weeks.

For the first time Monday, Pritzker delivered his daily briefing from his home office — a drawing of his late mother behind him — as he broadcast live after a senior staffer tested positive for coronavirus. The governor said he himself has tested negative twice for coronavirus.

The governor also offered some good news along with his bad news projections. After announcing his reopening plan last week that divides the state into four regions and evaluates phases of re-openings based on health metrics, Pritzker said all regions except for the Northeast region “are on pace” to be able to move to the next phase come May 29, the last day of the stay-at-home executive order.

The next phase, Phase 3, allows a number of businesses to reopen, with the use of “face coverings as the norm,” including non-essential manufacturing and some non-essential businesses, including barber shops and salons.

But in the Northeast region, home to Chicago and Cook County, the positivity rate — the number of positive cases compared to tests taken — remains too high. Still, the governor signaled there’s still time to get that number lower. His plan in part entails 14 days of a positivity rate under 20%.

In total, 3,459 people have died of coronavirus in Illinois — 803 of them last week. As of Monday, the state also reported 1,266 new cases, bringing the total of positive cases to 79,007. The state received 12,441 tests results.

In late April, Pritzker’s office released a COVID-19 projection and worst-case fatality scenario based on scientific modeling that predicted a range of 50 to 150 deaths per day into early May. That projection was created by researchers from the Illinois Department of Public Health, as well as researchers from Northwestern University, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The latest projection shows Illinois is indeed in a peak period for coronavirus deaths, but it’s less like a peak and more like a plateau.

The death range remains between 50 and 150 a day in models from both the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Northwestern University, however, is projecting a range of 50 to 300 daily deaths. The University of Chicago predicts the state seeing a death plateau until July, while both Northwestern and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are predicting it could last until June.

Beginning on April 23, the state saw 11 days in that originally predicted death range. On May 4, 46 deaths were reported. On May 5, the state saw its worst day with 176 fatalities. And since May 6, the state has consistently seen between 50 and 150 deaths a day, which is what the modelers predicted.

“We haven’t passed our peak yet. We have seen more stability in our numbers, but so far, we are not seeing significant declines in key metrics like hospitalization,” Pritzker said. “The updates to our models reflect that data.”

Pritzker said the time frame of “plateauing near a peak” into mid-May “has been expanded from mid-May into mid-June.”

“In many ways, this news is disheartening,” Pritzker said. “We have made great progress, but it’s forced us to remain at a moderated though still high level of key metrics for this extended period. A pushing out of our estimated peak is a natural consequence of flattening the curve. Remember that no one can truly stop this virus without a vaccine. But what we’ve been aiming to do since early March is slow down the exponential rate of transmission.”

The slowing down, he said, has helped health care workers to treat those with coronavirus and give pharmaceutical researchers time to develop effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine.

“Pushing the peak down and therefore to a longer time frame might not sound like good news to some, but I promise you it is saving lives,” Pritzker said.

The number of COVID-19 patients entering ICU beds went up by 16, from Saturday to Sunday night, according to Pritzker’s office. The number of ventilators being used by coronavirus patients also increased by 21, and the total number of COVID-19 patients increased by 26 patients.

The positivity rate statewide as of Monday is 10.17%. In the Northeast region, which includes Cook County and Chicago, the positivity rate is about 22%.

Meanwhile, Pritzker’s administration said the state has not yet received a shipment of swabs and viral transport media from the federal government. That shipment was anticipated in early May but has not yet arrived. The governor’s administration is also asking for federal help in obtaining surgical gowns, which are going fast, they said.",1
1033,1033,1229,"Op-Ed: Amazon, it's time to disclose your coronavirus deaths","Grocery store workers and others stage a protest rally outside the Whole Foods Market, in the South End of Boston, to demand personal protective equipment, added benefits if needed and hazard pay, during the coronavirus pandemic on Apr. 7, 2020.

Our essential workers are dying.

Just this week, we learned of three more Amazon warehouse workers who have died due to Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths to seven. Unofficial tallies, mostly tracked by concerned Amazon employees who receive text message alerts whenever one of their colleagues catches the coronavirus, peg the total number of cases at 900 or more.

There could easily be more deaths and infections within Amazon's walls, but the company has declined to disclose the impact the pandemic has had on its employees. Instead, Amazon has only verified deaths when they're dug up by members of the media, leaving us with a fuzzy picture at best as to how dangerous this work actually is.

Amazon disagrees. In an interview with ""60 Minutes"" on May 10, Amazon's operations boss David Clark said disclosing the number of ""isn't particularly useful,"" and instead said the focus should be on the rate of cases relative to the number of workers in a warehouse and the communities in which they live. Amazon hasn't disclosed that rate either.

Amazon should release the number of infections and deaths among its workforce, or, at the very least, figures that show the rate of the infections inside its warehouses.

Our notion of an ""essential worker"" has dramatically changed since the start of the pandemic. It's not just doctors, nurses, police officers, firefighters and members of the military. In the time of the coronavirus, the definition has expanded to include sanitation workers, grocery store clerks, food-delivery workers and warehouse workers who ship goods ordered online.

Over the last few months, we've called these workers heroes. We've asked them to show up to work amid a deadly pandemic that has already killed at least 86,000 people and affected at least 1.4 million in the U.S. They're working in crowded buildings, behind checkout counters shielded with plexiglass and in hotspots like New York City where the virus continues to spread and kill hundreds of people per day.

We're asking them to do it all without a clear picture of just how dangerous the work actually is. We're asking them to choose between no paycheck and putting their lives at risk. We're asking them to do all this just to keep the basic standard of living we've become accustomed to humming as a virus ravages the country.

If Amazon disclosed its infection and death data, it would provide valuable insight not just to workers who need to make decisions about their paychecks and health, but also to employers grappling with the same issues as Amazon.

As other businesses slowly begin to open again across the country, they'll need all the help they can get to make sure they're protecting their workers and customers, just like the essential businesses who have been operating through the pandemic have done. There are lessons to learn, but those lessons become more difficult without the data.

Amazon's biggest rival in retail, Walmart, also has a slew of reported Covid-19 cases and deaths, but has routinely declined to disclose its own data and faces a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of one of its employees who died from the coronavirus. Other horror stories have cropped up in essential businesses from Tyson meat plants to grocery store chains like Costco and Kroger that are grappling with long lines and customers angry over social distancing rules.

Amazon has proven it can be a leader. For example, in October 2018, Amazon announced it would raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour. But Amazon went further than just raising wages. It also said it would advocate to bring the federal minimum wage up to the same standard, and CEO Jeff Bezos dared other large employers to do the same.

""We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,"" Bezos said in a statement at the time. ""We're excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.""

Now it's time for Amazon to lead again. It's an icon of American industry, like General Electric and General Motors were decades ago. It's the company many businesses admire and look to for guidance. Through its innovation and relentless drive, Amazon has earned the burden of setting the standard for how business works in this country.

So far, Amazon has done a great job talking about the safety measures it has taken to protect its warehouse workers. It provides regular updates on its dedicated Covid-19 blog, which reads like a template for just about any large business grappling with how to safely operate during the pandemic. Face masks. Temperature checks. Social distancing. Hand sanitzer. Gloves. And so on. Amazon should be commended for moving as rapidly as it could to implement these changes throughout its sprawling logistics network. That's no small feat.

On top of that, Amazon said it plans to reinvest all of its profits this quarter -- an estimated $4 billion -- into its Covid-19 response. Hundreds of millions of dollars of that will go towards its own development of Covid-19 tests, a key to getting all of its employees safely back to work. It said it could spend $1 billion on testing alone this year. Compare that to the White House's response to the testing shortage.

Workers are scared, even as they do important work for pay that doesn't match up to the risk they're taking. Amazon has the opportunity to shine light on just how dangerous this work is by being the first major important to disclose its worker death and infection counts.

Hopefully others would then follow Amazon's lead.",1
531,531,652,‘The Universe Hit Pause’: The Ripple Effects of Broadway’s Shutdown,"
Wuhan. Bergamo. Seattle. New Rochelle.By the time cast, crew and fans assembled on March 9 for the first preview of a new musical version of “Mrs. Doubtfire,” the coronavirus was at the stage door.
All over Broadway, theater operators were installing hand sanitizer dispensers and scrubbing armrests. Ticket holders were beginning to bail.
“Hadestown” barred stage-door greetings. An usher who worked at “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and “Six” tested positive for Covid-19. And “Moulin Rouge!” canceled a day’s performances because a company member was feverish.
“Mrs. Doubtfire” got through three performances before Broadway shut down.“Our house manager texted us and told us to hold on, and then she said, ‘Don’t come, don’t come, don’t come’,” recalled Lisa Berger, a “Doubtfire” usher. “It wasn’t a total surprise, to be honest. I just didn’t think it was going to happen that quickly.”
Now two months have gone by, and almost everyone associated with the production — about 150 people — is out of work: actors and musicians, obviously, but also bartenders and box office workers, carpenters and choreographers, designers and dressers, programmers and propmasters. A few vendors — the publicists, for example — were furloughed and then rehired under the federal Paycheck Protection Program — but even they expect to be unemployed when that money runs out after eight weeks.
“People think of Broadway as very glamorous, but I don’t think they understand how many families and lives depend on it,” said David Korins, the show’s set designer. He was forced to lay off most of his employees after all 24 productions his company was working on, including “Hamilton,” “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Beetlejuice,” abruptly stopped.
“Everything went away,” he said. “It was a cascade. And, by the way, I fully endorse it. But, literally, our income went to zero.”
Broadway, of course, is a summit for theatermakers, a symbol of New York and a big business that, until now, had been enjoying an extended boom. Last year was the best attended on record, with 14.6 million patrons; Broadway shows collectively grossed $1.8 billion.
The shutdown brought an abrupt end to that prolonged party. And among the 39 plays and musicals halted were 16 that never even made it to opening night, “Doubtfire” included.
“Doubtfire” was a big bet, aimed squarely at the sweet spot of the Broadway audience: a $17 million musical, adapted from a hit movie, that aspired to be funny, poignant and family-friendly.
Now the “Doubtfire” family has scattered across the country — some as close as Times Square, some as far as London — trying to stay safe and sane. They, like the rest of their theater world colleagues, have no idea when New York will settle in to some new normal, no idea when Broadway will attempt a comeback. They are worried, but also hopeful — a microcosm of an industry that is distressed but determined.
‘We’re doing the right thing.’“Mrs. Doubtfire” is a story about family. One family, really: The Hillards — Daniel, Miranda and their three children. The parents split up, and the father (memorably portrayed in the 1993 film by Robin Williams) is so determined to spend time with his children that he pretends to be a woman to land a job as the housekeeper.
Hilarity ensues. Trouble looms. Lessons are learned.After a five-week pre-Broadway run at Seattle’s 5th Avenue Theater, the stage adaptation headed for Broadway facing headwinds — reviews in Seattle were mixed, shifting gender politics had made men in dresses an unreliable laugh line, and a stage adaptation of “Tootsie” had just flopped. Plus, every Broadway show is enormously risky, because most of them fail.
But the producers, led by the Broadway veteran Kevin McCollum (“Rent,” “Avenue Q”), were feeling confident as they sped toward an April 5 opening night. The audiences in Seattle seemed to like the show. And the lead actor, Rob McClure, who scored a Tony nomination for playing the title role in “Chaplin,” starred in “Honeymoon in Vegas,” and was featured most recently in “Beetlejuice,” was nailing his bifurcated performance.
Then, McClure said, “The universe hit pause.”On that final day, the cast had gathered for an afternoon rehearsal knowing that, at any time, Broadway might shut down. “I’ll never forget checking my phone during our Wednesday evening performance and seeing that the N.B.A. had suspended the season, and knowing what was coming,” said Brad Oscar, a two-time Tony nominee for “Something Rotten!” and “The Producers.”
Jenn Gambatese, the actress starring as Miranda (a role played on film by Sally Field), was center stage, rehearsing new blocking for her big solo number, when a stage manager told the company to brace for a closing announcement. She kept going for another 90 minutes.
“I felt calmer than I had in a while, and felt like I could focus better,” said Gambatese, who had been so unnerved by the drumbeat of virus news that she brought a suitcase to work in case her commuter rail line was shut down and she got stuck in Midtown. “Every day was getting scarier and scarier,” she said.
Midafternoon, McCollum and the show’s director, Jerry Zaks, assembled the company and told everyone to grab their stuff and go home.
And just like that, it was over. The costumes were stored in dressing rooms. The souvenir tote bags and tumblers were locked in a cabinet. The ghost light — a bare bulb placed onstage when a theater is empty — was illuminated.
Many expected they’d be back in four weeks — the initial projected length of the shutdown. “I remember placing my pencil down on my script and thinking to myself, ‘It’s so weird — that pencil is going to be in exactly the same place when we come back in a month,’” said Philip S. Rosenberg, the lighting designer.
McClure went home to Philadelphia. Tara Llewellyn, a dresser, joined her grandmother in Connecticut. KJ Hippensteel, a member of the ensemble, fled to his father-in-law’s house in Cleveland with his wife and their two sons.
“Both of us lost our jobs, for now, and we had no reason to stay,” he said. “Really, we panicked and had to take action to feel like we were in control. In hindsight I think we were super lucky to have gotten out when we did.”
Among those who stayed: Peter Bartlett, a comedic character actor and the oldest member of the cast, who plays a television host named Mr. Jolly. “At 77, this is the true passages of terror,” he said.
Most of the time, Bartlett has been holed up in his one-bedroom apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, sustained by savings, Social Security and union pensions, talking to friends, reading, cleaning his kitchen and washing his hands. “Did I ever think I’d watch a dog rescue on YouTube? Now I’ve watched hundreds of them,” he said. “Anything to distract myself.”
Others are finding their own distractions, like making ice cream, or practicing yoga. “Destruction leaves a lot of creative space to occupy,” said Akilah Ayanna, an ensemble member who is working on an album.
So Alexandra Matteo, a company member who understudies several parts, is podcasting. Tommy Kurzman, the makeup and prosthetics designer, adopted a dog. Paul Woodiel, the concertmaster, is singing cowboy songs with his wife (they are both violinists).
“We have nice harmonies going on ‘Keep on the Sunny Side,’” he said, “if only I could get through the lyrics without choking up.”
‘It has upended our lives.’Broadway is a coveted corner of the theater world for many reasons — prestige, large audiences, enormous talent. But it’s important for a much more materialistic reason: in a low-paying, high unemployment field, it’s a place where theater artists can earn a good salary. The base pay for actors on Broadway is about $2,200 a week.
But the shutdown has thrown thousands out of work. Most union members got a few weeks’ pay after the closing, but that has long since ended. And the usual fallbacks when stage shows are scarce — television, film, even waiting tables — are unavailable during this phase of the pandemic.
“Pretty much everyone I know is planning on not paying their rent, because how are we expected to do that?” said Cameron Rasmussen, one of the show’s three guitarists.
Several members of the company are married to others in the industry, meaning they are now facing a double income loss. Michael Rico Cohen, a stage manager, is married to a freelance television producer. “It’s going to be quite a few months before either of us sees a real paycheck again,” he said. And Colleen Dietz, the show’s music copyist (preparing the score for individual musicians), is married to Zachary Dietz, the music director. “I know we will come back from this, but it will be a long, hard road for New York and for our family,” she said.
Among the more complex predicaments is that facing the family of 9-year-old Lily Tamburo, who was cast as the understudy for Natalie, one of the three Hillard children. Lily lives in the Setaukets, on Long Island, with her mother and three older siblings; when the late-night commute proved too exhausting at her age, her mother, Lauren Zummo, rented an apartment in the city for the two of them. But when the pandemic hit, Zummo was forced to shut down the Pilates and yoga studio she runs on Long Island, and, of course, Lily lost her income. Zummo was able to walk away from the Manhattan sublet, but not the studio, where her landlord is insisting on being paid.
“The virus has bankrupted us, obviously,” Zummo said.This pandemic is primarily a public health crisis, and Broadway has been hit hard by the disease — multiple members of the “Moulin Rouge!” cast fell ill, as did a number of theater artists, producers and publicists. The “Doubtfire” family has been relatively fortunate on that front, but not unscathed.
Korins, the set designer, lost his uncle to Covid-19. He was 80, and had just moved in January from Florida to Yonkers, N.Y., where he fell ill at an assisted-living facility and died at a hospital. “He died alone, not having spoken to anyone for several days,” Korins said. “It’s one of those unbelievably tragic moments.”
Others have found themselves caring for those infected. Calvin L. Cooper, an actor in the ensemble, saw one friend test positive for Covid-19, and then another fall ill.
“For nine long, scary days I helped nurse my friend back to stable levels,” he said. “He is called presumably positive. I am presumably asymptomatic.”
And both members of the show’s choreography team — Lorin Latarro, the choreographer, and MJ Slinger, her associate, are partnered with doctors who worked with Covid patients. Latarro is married to a neurosurgeon who was redeployed to Covid care; she and their 2-year-old daughter moved out for several weeks to avoid infection. “I know some families have it worse,” she said. “We are back home together now.”
‘I can’t control if my voice changes.’Maria Dalanno was one of the last people to join the “Doubtfire” cast. She was 18 and still in high school in Ohio when she submitted an audition video shot by her mother; five days later, she booked a part as the understudy for Lydia, the older Hillard daughter.
She left high school, deferred college and moved to New York. Now she’s back home, playing with her dog and painting.
“I made my debut in previews, and then moved right back home in the midst of a pandemic,” she said. “I am now worrying about following social distancing guidelines, being able to pay for my apartment, and when I will see my new friends and castmates again.”
For the six performers playing children in the “Doubtfire” cast — each character has an understudy — the shutdown has been particularly tough to understand.
“Getting a break on Broadway, especially for a child, is nothing short of a miracle,” said Shanna Sell, whose 9-year-old daughter, Avery Sell, was making her Broadway debut as Natalie, the younger Hillard daughter. The Sells live in Florida, and Avery is now back in New Port Richey. “Having the rug pulled out from underneath her little feet, just weeks before her debut, has been nothing short of heartbreaking,” Shanna Sell said.
Jake Ryan Flynn, the 13-year-old Massachusetts boy who plays the Hillards’ son, Christopher, has his own concern — that if the Broadway shutdown drags on, he will age out of the role. This is his second Broadway show — he was one of three boys alternating in the title role of “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” and he knows that contracts allow producers to replace children as they grow too tall.
“My parents keep telling me to only worry about what I can control,” he said. “But right now it feels like I’m in control of nothing in my life. I can’t control if I grow. I can’t control if my voice changes. I can’t control when I will see my cast mates again. I can’t control if the creatives and producers take a look at me in a few months and fire me because I’m too big. It just makes me sad.”
‘It felt like a miracle that we were all able to connect.’The invitations came from Mark Evans, a Welsh actor playing Stuart Dunmire, the new love interest for Miranda Hillard.
Put on something fun. Grab a snack or a drink. Turn on your computer.On April 5, the night that “Doubtfire” was scheduled to open on Broadway, the company instead gathered online and performed the show — beginning to end — just for one another.
They called it their Fauxpening. Eighty-two people participated. Kaleigh Cronin, an ensemble member sheltering with her husband and dog at her parents’ house in New Hampshire, wore the dress from her 8th grade dance, which she found in her childhood closet.
There were speeches and stories, songs and slip-ups — Evans was so busy organizing that when the second act rolled around he forgot his lines. Onscreen, the actors sang their songs. In the chat section, some of the stage managers typed out cues.
“Zoom was still a novelty, as opposed to the norm,” Evans said. “It felt like a miracle that we were all able to connect.”
There are other forms of connection, too. Felicia Shulman, the guardian responsible for protecting the show’s child actors, has tried to knit the four youngest members of the cast together through group texts and FaceTime. “Keeping them all in touch is something that I think is very important during this time of the unknown,” she said.
There’s also a newsletter of sorts. Aaron Kaburick, an actor who plays several minor characters including a “Chef Louis,” distributes a weekly email. It was originally called “Chicken on the Block,” a reference to the show’s spatchcocking scene; it’s now called “Chicken on the Couch,” because of the quarantine. The publication is just a few sentences — fabricated gossip, inside jokes, the ensemble member Doreen Montalvo’s recipe for “Quarantine Coquito” and a “Doubtfire”-choreography-inspired workout routine from Casey Garvin, an understudy.
And there are ongoing get-togethers. Fauxpening was three weeks and three days after the closing, so, at Gambatese’s suggestion, the company decided to plan another reunion every three weeks and three days. The second one was late last month. “It was adorable,” McClure said. “We shouted over one another.”
‘It’s so empty, it’s unreal.’The Stephen Sondheim Theater, where “Doubtfire” was being staged, exhibits many of Broadway’s real estate complexities. Its history, and its facade on West 43rd Street, go back to 1918, but the interior, which opened in 2009, is underground, beneath the 55-story Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park.
The 1,055-seat theater is operated by a nonprofit, the Roundabout Theater Company, which is renting it to the commercial producers of “Mrs. Doubtfire.”
The building is still “Doubtfire”-branded, with a marquee and pastel-colored posters promoting the show. But there are also signs of the times: Anita’s Way, a pedestrian passage alongside the theater, has become, with the disappearance of pedestrians, a resting spot for the homeless.
The only person still regularly going inside is Deosarran, a one-named 58-year-old Guyanese immigrant who works for Roundabout as a building engineer.
Once or twice a week, Deosarran — everyone calls him Dino — gets into his car and drives in to Times Square from his home in Harrison, N.J., to make his rounds at the four theaters Roundabout operates in Midtown. He starts early — around 5 a.m. — to increase the ease of social distancing, and he checks the buildings’ temperature, the humidity, the plumbing and even the roofs.
“In the beginning I was nervous, but I bought some masks and gloves and I mingle with no one,” said Deosarran, who moved to the United States at age 14, took a job pumping gas and has been working in Broadway theaters for most of his adult life. “It’s very strange to see these theaters with no show. On 42nd Street you see one or two people walking. It’s unbelievable.”
There are other eyes on the building — security, cops and a few less expected observers. Connie Robinson, the manager of theater operations for Roundabout, monitors by video camera from her home in the Bronx while baking up a storm — sweet potato buns, banana pudding cheesecake, crepes. “It’s so empty, it’s unreal,” she said.
And James Kabel, the wardrobe supervisor, walks over from his apartment in Times Square. He gazes at the “Doubtfire” images on the theater’s windows, just “to make sure it’s not just a dream.”
‘I’m not going to imagine anything but that it’s going to happen.’It was one of the first scenes the writers cooked up: Deep in the second act, Daniel Hillard would have a nightmare in which he is haunted by multiple Mrs. Doubtfires, forcing him to confront his feelings of inadequacy.
The power rock song, “You’ve Created a Monster,” was rousingly sung, wild to look at (a stageful of Doubtfires!), and regularly prompted applause. But gnawing at the creative team was the sense that it stopped the storytelling.
The problem: The number as written suggested that Daniel Hillard’s big fear was that Mrs. Doubtfire was better than him. But the musical is fueled by his more fundamental terror: that he would lose his children.
So, in one of the surest signs that Team “Doubtfire” fully expects the show to return, the now-dispersed creative team, who previously collaborated on “Something Rotten!”, overhauled the song via Skype. Wayne Kirkpatrick, back home in Nashville; his brother, Karey Kirkpatrick, in Los Angeles; and John O’Farrell, in London.
So they decided to refocus the scene. “You can’t have a song that’s not moving the story forward,” Karey Kirkpatrick said. “So we made it about the kids — they’re no longer dressed as Doubtfires, and there are lyric changes to support the storytelling.”
And they set about shortening the musical’s ending. “You want to leave them wanting more, as opposed to saying get on with it already,” Karey Kirkpatrick said.
Trimming was not easy because in the final 12 minutes McClure has six costume changes, from Hillard to Doubtfire and back again — and each one takes at least 23 seconds. But the writers now have a series of proposed cuts they want to test whenever they get back to the stage.
“If you just listen, the show will tell you what it needs,” Karey Kirkpatrick said.
It’s unclear what happens next. Industry leaders say that September is the earliest they can imagine Broadway resuming performances, but that it is possible shows won’t return until next year.
Broadway has multiple vulnerabilities: high costs, tightly packed seating, and a fan base that includes many tourists and seniors.
The longer the shutdown continues, the more shows are expected to close before even opening, succumbing to cash flow issues and economic concerns. Zaks, a four-time Tony winner directing on Broadway for the 25th time with “Doubtfire,” refuses even to consider that this show could be among the missing. “I’m not going to imagine anything but that it’s going to happen,” he said.
He can take solace from McCollum, the lead producer, who vows that “Doubtfire” will return. “I’m sad that everyone has to wait, but the show is ready to go, and when people gather, we’ll be ready to open,” he said. “We’re birthing this new piece, and I can’t wait to show it to the world.”
As for McClure, the show’s star, he is practicing a combination of patience and optimism.“I don’t think it would be in Broadway’s best interest to open too soon and be part of another wave of this — I don’t think anyone in our industry is interested in that,” he said. “But when I think about the first night back, when the overture starts and the curtain goes up, I choke up. I really do. It’s the culmination of everything we’re craving — more than the singing and the dancing and this great American art form, it’s a bunch of people telling a story and a bunch of people receiving a story. We’re craving the collective experience of being human. And that’s what theater is.”",1
480,480,586,Grant Park Music Festival canceled due to coronavirus pandemic,"Chicago’s outdoor music festival season has suffered its latest casualty due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The Grant Park Music Festival on Monday announced the cancellation of its 2020 season, originally set for June 10-Aug. 15 at the Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park and other locations across the Chicago area. More than 300,000 people attend the festival each year.

The free classical music festival, featuring the Grant Park Orchestra, under the direction of artistic director and principal conductor Carlos Kalmar, and the Grant Park Chorus, under the direction of Christopher Bell, has been a summertime tradition since 1935. Attracting world-renowned musicians and singers from across the country and around the world, the festival has continuously provided a diverse repertoire of classical music favorites and world premieres. In addition, the festival has been home to classic movie nights (featuring the orchestra providing live accompaniment to screenings of some of Hollywood’s greatest musicals) and Broadway show celebrations.

Among the festival’s canceled events are the annual Independence Day Salute extravaganza, all neighborhood parks programming, as well as master classes and open rehearsals.

“We’re still working to calculate the losses we will experience as a result of a summer without the Grant Park Music Festival,” said festival president and CEO Paul Winberg in statement. ”We hope our longstanding friends and donors will continue to maintain their support during this difficult time, helping the festival to return next summer stronger and more vibrant than ever.”

The news comes on the heels of several other summer music festival cancellations recently announced, including the Chicago Blues Festival, the Chicago Gospel Festival, the Chicago House Music Conference & Festival and the Ravinia Festival in Highland Park.",1
573,573,703,Tesla plans to partially reopen Fremont factory on Friday,"Tesla plans to resume “limited operations” at its Fremont car plant on Friday, bringing back about 30 percent of its workforce, according to emails sent to employees Thursday night. Fremont is located in Alameda County, however, which said in a statement that it’s still under shelter-in-place. Bloomberg was first to report on the emails sent from CEO Elon Musk and Tesla HR boss Valerie Capers Workman.

Alameda County, where the Fremont factory is located, doesn’t see it quite the same way. “We have not said that it’s appropriate to move forward,” Erica Pan, Alameda County’s health officer, said about Tesla, according to Bloomberg. The county told Tesla it didn’t meet criteria to reopen, Bloomberg reported.

Although California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Thursday that manufacturing industries can start to reopen in the state, his guidance does not override county-level restrictions, according to CNBC.

That didn’t stop Tesla’s Musk from jumping on the opportunity:

“In light of Governor Newsom’s statement earlier today approving manufacturing in California, we will aim to restart production in Fremont tomorrow afternoon. I will be on the line personally helping wherever I can. However, if you feel uncomfortable coming back to work at this time, please do not feel obligated to do so. These are difficult times, so thanks very much for working hard to make Tesla successful!”

Tesla’s Fremont plant had been (mostly) idle since March 23rd in compliance with a shelter-in-place order, just as it was beginning to deliver its new Model Y car. Musk has been a vocal critic of California’s lockdown orders, arguing they violate constitutional rights.

1029,1029,1225,Charts show how new coronavirus cases are progressing daily in 20 states as a majority of the US starts to reopen,"A majority of US states have eased stay-at-home orders and are allowing some businesses to reopen.

Some states, like Texas, have already seen a surge in new cases.

But it's still too early to draw definitive conclusions about the effects of loosened restrictions, since data on confirmed cases and deaths lags behind the on-the-ground reality.

These interactive charts show how many new COVID-19 cases are being reported daily in 20 states.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Across the US, 30 states have relaxed aspects of their stay-at-home orders and allowed certain businesses to reopen, hoping the worst is behind them. Meanwhile, 18 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam remain under lockdown.

Public-health experts have repeatedly warned that lifting lockdowns too early could lead to more waves of coronavirus transmission, which could force states to implement new lockdowns to curb the virus' spread.

Some states have already seen cases spike. Less than two weeks after its stay-at-home order expired, Texas reported its largest daily increase in new coronavirus cases and deaths. Others states, including Florida and Georgia, eased restrictions in recent weeks even though case numbers weren't declining, but have seen them hold relatively stable so far. States like New York and Washington, where outbreaks hit earlier and lockdowns are still in effect, have reported steady declines in new cases.

However, we don't yet have definitive answers as to how states' decisions to loosen restrictions are impacting their outbreaks. That's because new case data can lag several weeks behind what's actually happening — people who get COVID-19 take an average of five days to develop symptoms, then may need to wait multiple days for test results. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has estimated that numbers we see today reflect infections that occurred about two weeks ago.

In states that aren't doing extensive testing, many cases might also not show on public health officials' radars at all.

Still, based on our best current information, here's what the progression of new cases reported each day looks like in 20 US states that have had significant COVID-19 outbreaks.",1

Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has been hospitalized for the coronavirus, becoming the fifth senior government official in the country to get the virus.

State-run news agency RIA Novosti broke the news on Tuesday. There are no further details on Peskov's condition.

Peskov is the second official in Putin's administration to get the virus, after Putin's chief of staff Sergei Kiriyenko tested positive in mid-April, according to The Moscow Times.

Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin also tested positive at the end of April, in addition to Russia's ministers for Construction and Culture. Mishustin has helped lead the country's coronavirus response.

572,572,702,The stock market's recent surge makes sense if you actually look at the US economy,"A number of stories have emerged pointing out a supposed disconnect between ""Main Street"" — the US economy which is being hit by the pandemic — and Wall Street — which has seen stocks rally.

But there are signs that the US economy has already bottomed and activity is starting to come back.

And since equities are forward looking, the gradual recovery of the stock market actually makes sense.

Does that mean things in the economy are good? Of course not. But stocks tend to get better before the economy is ""good.""

Neil Dutta is head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

With the stock market rallying sharply off its March 23 low, the usual cries have started: stocks are missing the economic reality, they're whistling by the graveyard, they're completely divorced from economic fundamentals.

In the last week: the Economist claims ""A dangerous gap has opened between America's stock market and the real economy."" Noted economic pundit Mohamed El-Erian argued that the ""Market keeps distancing itself from the economy."" But that is not so surprising early on.

Admittedly, current economic conditions are poor. Economic output has cratered, leaving widespread joblessness in its wake.

But this does not necessarily mean equity prices should be substantially lower than they are now. The US equity market is not about whether economic conditions are good or bad. Rather, what matters is whether conditions are improving or getting worse.

Today, the evidence is mounting that economic conditions, while far from good, are starting to improve. This is why stocks are up.

Hitting the bottom

Generally speaking, economic conditions can be thought of in two ways: momentum and level of activity. The momentum in the economy represents how quickly conditions are changing in relation to the past while level of activity in the economy measures how far conditions are from their historical averages.

For instance, the US can add thousands of jobs — that shows positive momentum — while the unemployment rate — the level — remains well above its historically average. Momentum needs to be positive in order for the level of activity to improve.

Consider the period following the 2009 recession. It took many years for the level of economic activity to return to potential, as the chart below demonstrates. Even as potential growth repeatedly got revised down, the level of growth hit potential sometime in 2017. Still, this period was an especially good one for stock prices even if for many, it ""didn't feel like"" a recovery.

Today, the evidence is mounting that the level of activity has bottomed – that is, conditions are not getting any worse – and the momentum in the economy has picked up somewhat.

Motor gasoline demand bottomed for the week ending April 10 and has been climbing, retracing about one-third of its decline since mid-March.

Mortgage purchase applications also bottomed for the week ending April 10, similarly recouping about 40 percent of its plunge since mid-March.

Passenger screenings at our nation's airports are also on the mend. The count is now about double the April 14 low, but still 93% off its year-ago level.

Notice that the timing of this improvement precedes the formal lifting of shelter-in-place orders for nearly all states. Thus, it stands to reason that there is room for at least some improvement once formal lockdowns end.

Of course, there are risks to the outlook. Double-dips in the economy are usually about policy choices. Almost always, double-dips are about policy choices after a recovery starts.

For example, in 1982, the economy saw a deep recession after a brief recovery because the Federal Reserve tightened interest rates to take on inflation. In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, the policy choice would be to shut parts of the economy down if the virus spread gets worse.

That said, markets have rallied for good reason and the message from stocks is not all that different from what I see in the economy. Economic conditions are no longer getting worse and the re-opening is likely to be measured. Still, we see modest improvement across a range of metrics.

Does that mean things in the economy are good? Of course not. But stocks tend to get better before the economy is ""good.""",1
875,875,1047,Here's How Much Congress Has Approved For Coronavirus Relief So Far And What It's For,"Here's How Much Congress Has Approved For Coronavirus Relief So Far And What It's For

Loading...

Updated at 6:58 a.m. ET Saturday

Congress has authorized roughly $3 trillion in coronavirus relief in four separate measures over the last two months. These bills attempt to protect the American economy from long-term harm caused by stay-at-home orders and respond to the overall impact of the virus.

On Friday, the House approved a Democrats-only bill to spend another $3 trillion. Republicans have rejected the proposal, known as the HEROES Act, and are calling for a pause on new aid. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says the latest legislation is her starting point for any new negotiations.

In several cases, Congress voted on the relief spending with little time to review the proposals and without an official cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. But now CBO has released estimates showing that the costs of some programs are expected to outpace early projections — driving up the total cost of the bills.

These long-term expenses will be added on top of recent projections from the CBO that the U.S. deficit would be more than $3.7 trillion in 2020.

The NPR Politics Podcast House Democrats Push For Money For States In New Relief Bill House Democrats Push For Money For States In New Relief Bill Listen · 14:56 14:56

NPR reviewed data and estimates reported by the CBO to break down how Congress allocated money to respond to the pandemic. Those estimates, known as scores, detail how much the agency expects programs will cost and how those measures will impact the debt, deficit and government revenue.

In some cases, Congress approved a fixed amount of money for a program, like the Paycheck Protection Program loans for small businesses.

In other cases, like the expanded unemployment insurance and tax credits for emergency paid family and sick leave, Congress approved the credits and their values but did not put a cap on the expenditures. When that happens, the CBO estimates the number of people and companies that may take advantage of the program. The CBO often provides those estimates in two-year figures, in part because it may take time for businesses and individuals to file claims.

Here's how the coronavirus relief money breaks down.

The bulk of the support for individuals was approved in the second and third packages, known as the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Stability Act, also known as CARES.

The biggest expenditures on individuals have been on cash relief payments, expansions to unemployment assistance, emergency family and medical leave.

Cash relief payments: $293 billion (estimated)

Many people have already started to receive direct deposits totaling as much as $1,200 under the program known as recovery rebates. Individuals earning less than $75,000 can expect a one-time cash payment of $1,200. Married couples would each receive a check and families would get $500 per child. That means a family of four earning less than $150,000 can expect $3,400.

The checks start to phase down after that and disappear completely for people making more than $99,000 and couples making more than $198,000.

The cash payments are based on most recent tax filings. People who receive Social Security payments, people experiencing homelessness and others who don't typically need to file tax return are still eligible, too.

Expanded unemployment insurance: $268 billion (estimated).

The third piece of legislation included temporary changes to federal unemployment benefits, including a supplemental benefit for all workers and new protections for gig workers.

Under the legislation, states will still pay base unemployment to people who qualify. That amount varies state by state, as does the amount of time people are allowed to claim it. Congress added $600 per week from the federal government on top of whatever base amount a worker receives from the state. That boosted payment will last through the end of July.

For example, if an out-of-work person is receiving the national average of about $340 per week, under the new federal program their take-home pay will be $940.

The legislation also adds 13 weeks of unemployment insurance. People nearing the maximum number of weeks allowed by their state would get an extension. New filers would also be allowed to collect the benefits for the longer period.

The estimated cost also includes a new, temporary Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program through the end of this year to help people who lose work as a direct result of the public health emergency.

The Congressional Budget Office made their predictions based on a model projecting an unemployment rate reaching 14% in the second quarter of this year and remaining at 10% at the end of 2021.

Administration officials have admitted in recent weeks that the rate could continue rise in the immediate term before recovering. The scorekeepers specifically noted that this is just a projection and the numbers could change, which would in turn change the overall cost of the changes to unemployment insurance.

Emergency family and medical leave: $105 billion (estimated).

The second bill congress approved included new tax credits for businesses to support emergency family and medical leave.

Under the bill, certain employers are required to give up to 80 hours of fully paid sick leave if the employee is unable to work because they are in quarantine and/or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking medical care. Those employers would also have to approve up to 80 hours of partially paid leave for people caring for someone under the same conditions or to care for a child under 18 whose regular child care facility or school is closed.

The Congressional Budget Office projects that offering employers fully refundable credits against payroll taxes to compensate employees for the leave will cost the government about $105 billion. This cost is unlike a program where the federal government pays for the benefit directly. Instead, the cost is based on the expectation that the Treasury Department will lose revenues as a result of the policies.

Cost reductions for individuals on federal health insurance programs: $8.6 billion (estimated two-year cost)

The second coronavirus relief bill eliminates any cost-sharing for people seeking testing and treatment for COVID-19 under Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. This was intended to make it easier for low-income people to get tested.

The total amount available to big businesses is well over $500 billion. The CARES Act includes a section described as Economic Stabilization and Assistance to Severely Distressed Sectors of the U.S. Economy. That is the long way of describing aid for big businesses. This includes emergency lending from the federal reserve, credit assistance to airlines and pandemic relief for airline workers.

Extra lending authority for the Federal Reserve: $454 billion (this money is expected to be fully recouped with fees and repayments)

This portion of the bill has a big price tag up front, but the CBO estimates that the repayment, fees and other economic activity will make up for the initial spending. They do not consider it a true cost to the federal budget or the deficit. The chart includes the money because it is an approved expenditure, but it is considered in a separate category than the remaining spending. The Federal Reserve has also taken separate actions that don't involve Congress.

Airlines: $58 billion

This money is allocated to help airlines stay open. One portion of that money is set aside to help cover employee wages, salaries and benefits divided up as up to $25 billion for passenger air carriers, up to $4 billion for cargo air carriers, and up to $3 billion for airline contractors.

Loading...

There is more than $800 billion in small business aid spread across the four bills that have passed so far. The biggest portion of that sum is dedicated to the forgivable loans in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The first round of PPP — $349 billion — ran out in less than two weeks. Congress approved another $321 billion that is still being spent.

Small businesses also have access to $21 billion in disaster grants plus some additional loan subsidies. There's also a tax credit for keeping employees on payroll that is estimated to cost about $52 billion.

Loading...

Some elements of the CARES act support a wide range of businesses without the size limitations included in the PPP. The legislation establishes a fully refundable tax credit for businesses of all sizes that are closed or distressed to help them keep workers on the payroll. The credit is expected to cost about $52 billion.

The goal is to help businesses re-hire employees that have already been laid off or furloughed. The credit covers to 50% of payroll on the first $10,000 of compensation, including health benefits, for each employee.

For employers with more than 100 full-time employees, the credit is for wages paid to employees when they are not providing services because of the coronavirus. Eligible employers with 100 or fewer full-time employees could use the deduction even if they aren't closed.

Other broader business supports include a delay in when payroll taxes are due, which the CBO estimates will cost $352 billion up front but will be largely repaid years in the future. There are also tax changes increasing the cap on net operating losses and changing the rules for interest deductibility.

All four bills include money to help support hospitals and public health systems. The most expensive items include funding for research and development, direct aid to hospitals and care centers, and money to offset more of the cost of treating Medicare patients.

The first bill focused primarily on public health and global health. It was passed in the weeks before it was clear how deeply the coronavirus would affect the U.S. It included $3.1 billion for vaccine and treatment research, $3.2 billion for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and $1.2 billion for the State Department to carry out global health programs.

The CARES Act provided $1.32 billion for community health centers that provide health care for roughly 28 million people.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention got another $4.3 billion from CARES and the Strategic National Stockpile received $16 billion.

Congress has set aside roughly $28 billion to help pay for testing and access to testing. Other spending areas, including funding for the CDC, Food and Drug Administration, and National Institutes of Health have been used to boost testing capacity and speed up the process of approvals.

Loading...

States and local governments have access to funds in a number of programs, particularly public health funding and money for publicly run hospitals and community health centers.

The Families First Coronavirus Response bill included $1 billion for state and local administrative costs, and CARES included $150 billion in direct aid to states for the coronavirus response.

There is long list of miscellaneous programs including those that shore up social safety net programs but do not pay money directly to individuals. In many cases, the funding helps support existing federal programs that have been stretched during the coronavirus response.

Child nutrition: There is $8.8 billion in the CARES Act to give schools more flexibility to provide meals for students.

Food stamps: CARES also included $15.5 billion for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. The money will help cover the expected cost of new applications to the program as a result of the coronavirus. That bill also included $450 million more for food banks and other community food distribution programs.

Government administration: CARES included $10 billion in lending for the Postal Service, the Families First Coronavirus bill gave the IRS $15 million to implement programs – the filing date was extended to July 15.",1
713,713,869,Lightfoot leans on community groups to curb spread of coronavirus among Latinos,"At a virtual town hall Wednesday evening, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she’s depending on “trusted” community groups to curb the spread of the coronavirus among Latinos.

On Wednesday, Latinos became the first racial or ethnic group in Chicago to record more than 10,000 cases of the coronavirus, according to data released by the city. Latinos now account for 42% of all COVID-19 cases despite making up around 30% of the population.

Lightfoot acknowledged shortcomings in the city’s efforts to reach Latinos early on in the pandemic, particularly residents who are primarily Spanish speakers.

Part of the problem, Lightfoot said, was the lack of testing sites in Latino neighborhoods.

“Early on, we were worried that there was a significant undercount among [Latinos] .... we were not getting enough demographic data from the providers doing testing so that we could fully measure the impact this virus,” she said.

Now that testing has ramped up and a clearer picture has emerged, Lightfoot said her administration is laser-focused on curbing the spread of the virus in neighborhoods that have recorded the biggest spikes like Little Village, Belmont Cragin and Archer Heights.

Crucial to curbing the spread of the virus in those areas are community health centers, Lightfoot said, which predominantly serve black and Latino Chicagoans and are open to everyone regardless of whether they health insurance, including undocumented immigrants.

Lightfoot called on those community health centers to refer patients to hotels the city has contracted to quarantine if they test positive for COVID-19, especially if they live in crowded, multigenerational households and can’t isolate.

“Early on in our response to this virus, we set up hotels that were specifically designated for quarantining and isolation, and so we need to do a better job of communicating the availability of those resources in the Latinx community, and that’s where [community health centers] play a very important role,” Lightfoot said.

The city will also rely upon community groups who provide resources and know-your-rights trainings to immigrants, Lightfoot said, “and we are tapping into that network to help us both educate and understand the day-to-day lived experiences [of Latinos.]”

Lightfoot said social distancing and working from home are “luxuries” that many Latinos can’t afford and promised to make workplaces as safe as possible during the pandemic.

“The biggest issue we have,” said Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd), whose ward encompasses Little Village, “is that a lot residents who are deemed to work ‘essential’ jobs in industries where the proximity of workers lead to higher rates of the virus.”

Jorge Mujica, a labor organizer with Arise Chicago who listened in to the town hall Wednesday, said Lightfoot should send police officers to inspect work sites to ensure physical distancing measures are being implemented.

“It’s pointless to keep telling the community to stay at home if they’re being infected at work,” he said. “The mayor sent the cops over to the lakefront and to the 606 Trail, but she should really send to them factories to inspect whether or not workers are being protected.”

231,231,304,Gov. Pritzker fails to plan for Illinois recovery after pandemic — and residents panic,"Illinois has seen a record number of residents file for unemployment in recent weeks. Workers are being furloughed or losing their jobs altogether. Families are worried about making rent and feeding their kids.

As we work together to contain the spread of COVID-19, we must also have an open and active conversation about ensuring Illinois’ economic recovery is as strong as possible. That means establishing a process and timeline to safely and effectively open the economy, so we are not only protecting lives but also safeguarding livelihoods.

Opinion

Gov. J.B. Pritzker has failed to address Illinois’ broken unemployment system, which has been unable to deliver benefits to people desperate for a lifeline. He has been incapable of cutting through the confusion facing small business owners, gig workers, independent contractors and sole proprietors about the status of their benefits. And on Sunday, after the nation’s top infectious disease expert said some sectors of the economy might be able to start reopening in May, Pritzker finally hinted that the state is thinking about — just thinking about — how to safely get key sectors back online, but that remains a closed conversation.

The uncertainty created by Pritzker’s lack of leadership on these issues is making residents panic. We are hearing from them daily.

We heard from a Morton husband and wife team staring down $46,000 in property tax payments as their tenants can’t make rent.

We heard from an Eldorado trucker who saw his paycheck cut in half, and who wants the progressive income tax hike removed from the ballot for fear it will drive his customers out of state.

We heard from a new Chicago restaurant owner in the South Loop, who started a change.org petition that calls on the governor to fix a loophole in the small business loan program.

Pritzker has said repeatedly that he cannot count on the White House, but he isn’t offering details on recovery solutions of his own. He should follow the example of other states, such as Utah, where state and local governments are putting together their own plans to navigate reopening the economy without prompting a second-wave outbreak. Or the example of New York, which reached out to Google to fix their unemployment system so new federal benefits could reach self-employed workers.

My organization, the Illinois Policy Institute, is the strongest taxpayer advocate network in Illinois. I am proud that we have been able to use our megaphone to make sure the people of Illinois are seen and heard by state and local lawmakers, and we’ve fostered conversations within our community as to what should happen next.

Those conversations are open-minded and productive. The same is not true in Springfield, where so far the only specifics residents have heard in the way of economic problem-solving is pointing the finger at the federal government. In a crisis, strong leaders prove themselves by stepping up and taking action. My organization has commended Pritzker on his efforts to contain the spread of the virus when it was warranted — we understand that public health and people’s lives must always come first.

But we hear almost every day from people struggling to make ends meet, with no money coming in this month or last, and no idea when they’ll be able to work again. So we decided to open up a conversation, asking people what they think and what they’d like their leaders to do.

Instead of offering help to the Illinoisans we highlighted, a spokesperson for the governor proceeded to attack us for providing them a forum.

That is not leadership.

Gov. Pritzker: Uncertainty is the enemy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a trying and unprecedented time, but that does not excuse defensive leadership that shifts blame. Accountability and openness are needed from those in whom the people have placed their trust — and to be specific, that means public confidence rises when Illinoisans see you and your team are open to ideas and working on a plan and a timeline to get the state back to work.

991,991,1184,"‘Steady decrease’ in coronavirus cases at Cook County Jail, officials say","Fewer people have tested positive for the coronavirus over the past month at Cook County Jail, officials announced Friday.

The rate of positive COVID-19 tests has gone from 97% to less than 10% since March, Cook County Health officials said in a statement.

Since May 8, most of the new cases have come from detainees entering the jail, rather than people who were already in custody, officials said.

They credited the decline to interventions implemented since the beginning of the year, including opening unused divisions to accommodate social distancing, converting available cells to single-occupancy and enhanced testing.

“As we watched this pandemic approach Cook County, we understood the potential impact it could have at the jail and worked with our public safety partners to release non-violent offenders,” Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said in the statement. “This was both the right thing to do for these individuals and the right thing to do to mitigate spread inside the jail.”

In March, the jail released several detainees deemed “highly vulnerable” to the coronavirus.

Earlier this month, the jail ran out of electronic monitoring bracelets, which inmate advocates warned could strain the sheriff’s office’s ability to socially distance detainees.

As of Friday evening, 115 detainees are currently positive for COVID-19, according to the Cook County sheriff’s office. So far, seven detainees and three sheriff’s office employees, including two correctional officers, have died from the virus.",1
1183,1183,1499,The leader of Belarus is using the coronavirus crisis to troll Putin,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1
302,302,385,"As my grandma lay dying, I could not hug her or hold her hand. But I will honor her memory with my vote on Nov. 3","I woke up on Thursday, March 26, in Chicago. We had been under Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order for nearly a week.

Other than to buy groceries, I had left my apartment only for short walks, eager for warm weather as Chicago’s winter finally began to fade. That day, Mayor Lori Lightfoot shut down Chicago’s lakefront because folks couldn’t seem to follow the rules. It felt like the teacher cancelling recess because of those two kids who just won’t listen.

Opinion

My days during the first week of stay-at-home had all been much of the same — work from home, exercise when I remembered, take in too much news (and wine) and slowly get through the unread books on my bookshelf. I had started writing “read during the COVID-19 pandemic” in the back of the books that I finished, thinking about the conversations I might have one day with my future children and grandchildren.

Video conversations with my family and friends were bright spots during a gloomy time.

But that Thursday was different. I woke up to a text from my sister saying there was a COVID-19 case at our grandma’s long-term care facility in Flossmoor. My siblings and I, spread across the country from Denver to New York, video-chatted, and then we talked with our mom. We were worried, unsure of what to do or how to react.

I thought about going up to Evanston to see my mother, but my fear of possibly exposing her to COVID-19, though I exhibited no symptoms, overwhelmed me. After all, I had been on airplanes less than two weeks before. The world had changed so dramatically.

My 90-year-old grandmother, who was immunocompromised, was experiencing shortness of breath that day. My mom drove down to Flossmoor and stood outside my grandmother’s window. She held up a sign that read “Love you.” Like me, my mother couldn’t physically be with her mother that day.

As my siblings and I talked with our mom over the phone, we heard the siren of an ambulance growing closer and louder. The louder it got, the more I knew the ambulance was coming for my grandma.

My grandma was admitted to the hospital with atrial fibrillation and low potassium, and she was tested for COVID-19. Not allowed inside the hospital, my mom sat in the parking lot as rain poured down, staring at a single-wide trailer being used to process emergency room admissions as she texted updates to my siblings and me.

The next day, I learned that my grandma had tested positive for COVID-19. I talked to her over the phone while she laid in bed without family by her side. She told me how proud she was of me and to keep doing good in the world. I told her how much I loved her and that I would continue to do my best to make the world a better place. A feeling that this would be our last conversation hung over me as tears filled my eyes.

On April 2, I learned that feeling was right. My mom called to tell me that my grandma had passed away. I am so thankful that my mom was able, eventually, to physically be with grandma before she passed, and that members of the family near and far were able to speak with her over the phone.

I know my story is like so many others. Loved ones suffering, families unable to physically be with one another. We can’t hug the people we love, can’t hold their hand in silence, can’t kiss them on the cheek.

The lucky among us get to say “I love you” over the phone; others will never have that opportunity, never get to say goodbye.

While I hope the federal government does all it can to combat this crisis, there is no doubt in my mind that President Trump’s lack of preparedness, competency, urgency and empathy has caused pain and suffering for my family and for families across the country. The tears that filled my eyes after talking to my grandma for the last time reflected that pain and suffering.

I am rooting for our country, but the president’s poor response to the coronavirus has motivated me to double my efforts to see that he and all those who enable him are voted out of office come November.

On March 27, less than one week before she died from COVID19, my grandma — Ruth G. Johnston — told me to keep doing good in the world. Well, that’s exactly what I plan to do.

See you in November, Mr. President.

1174,1174,1485,Some have tested positive for COVID-19 after recovering. What does that mean?,"At least 14 sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt who had recovered from COVID-19 have tested positive for a second time, raising questions about immunity and whether people can catch the coronavirus shortly after getting better.

The sailors who ""previously tested COVID positive and met rigorous recovery criteria have retested positive,"" a U.S. Pacific Fleet spokesperson said in a statement. The sailors are now off the ship and are required to isolate for at least 14 days.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Experts said the perplexing test results don't necessarily establish that a person can become infected twice — the positive results following negative tests may be a quirk related to the type of test that was used.

Nearly all of the diagnostic tests for COVID-19 in the U.S. look for snippets of the virus' RNA, or genetic code. (Another type of diagnostic test, called an antigen test, looks for proteins from the virus.)

But according to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present."" In other words, the test may be picking up a piece of the viral RNA that's been left behind, rather than a fully intact, infectious virus particle.

A second positive test after a negative result may mean the virus is simply taking its time leaving the body, doctors said, and is no longer able to infect others.

""It's possible that people could shed remnants of the virus for some period of time. That doesn't mean anything is wrong with them or that they are contagious,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.

A study from South Korea bolsters that idea. Researchers at the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed data on 285 COVID-19 patients who also tested positive after having appeared to recover.

Scientists were unable to find evidence that the patients remained infectious. And viral samples taken from the patients couldn't be prompted to grow and thrive in lab studies, suggesting that the samples were duds.

""What we're finding more and more is that the fragments of virus that are being picked up on these swabs weeks later are not able to replicate,"" said Dr. Ania Wajnberg, associate director of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. ""They're not live virus.""

Still, the world has known about COVID-19 only for mere months, giving scientists no indication yet of how the virus acts long term.

""We just don't have enough details yet to make confident statements about immunology,"" said Dr. John Sanders, chief of infectious diseases at Wake Forest Baptist Health in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Sanders said the different diagnostic results might also be explained by false negatives. ""I think that there is a lot to be learned about the testing and about the protective impact of having been infected or having developed an antibody,"" he said.

Sanders and a team of researchers at Wake Forest have embarked on an ambitious study to get a feel for how the virus acts in people, how long symptoms last and how COVID-19 might lead to immunity from secondary infections, at least for a certain period of time.

The group has enrolled 15,000 volunteers, some of whom have had COVID-19 and others who haven't. Each day, the volunteers are asked to record any possible symptoms they're experiencing. If a person reports any kind of symptom, such as fever or a cough, researchers ask for more information.

""We will send them a home test collection kit to send back to us. We'll test them to see if they have the virus and then continue to track them for antibodies after that,"" Sanders said.

The research team will upload the results into a database, tracking symptoms in real time. Ideally, public health officials could then compare the information with electronic health records. Sanders said the project aims to tease out whether an uptick in cough, for example, correlates with a true rise in COVID-19 or simply with allergy season.

The research group plans to conduct antibody testing on 10,000 of the volunteers six times over the next year. So far, all of the volunteers are from health systems in North Carolina, but researchers are working to expand the study along the East Coast.

""We have dozens of unanswered research questions about whether or not an antibody protects you against future infection, about whether or not you get complications after a COVID infection,"" Sanders said.

""This also allows us to collect the information necessary to start answering those more detailed questions.""

1229,1230,1594,It's too soon to declare kids 'less capable' of transmitting COVID-19: Experts,"It's too soon to declare kids 'less capable' of transmitting COVID-19: Experts

When will it be safe for children to return to the classroom?

That is the question being debated from the Oval Office to the dining room table, and the implications of doing so successfully will mark a significant turning point as societies look to emerge from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Over the weekend, a senior public health official declared that emerging case studies of various open schools abroad suggest children seem “less capable of spreading” the virus -- a welcome sign for parents eager to regain some sense of normalcy.

“What we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have not been big outbreaks in schools,” Soumya Swaminathan, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist, told the BBC on Sunday. “And where there have been it has been associated with events where a lot of people gather, not in regular classrooms. And it has often been associated with an adult who has had the infection and who spread it.""

But experts caution that while the emerging data is reassuring, it is simply too early to make any conclusive statements on whether or not children are less able to spread the virus relative to adults. The schools referenced by Swaminathan have all instituted social distancing and enhanced hygiene protocols that make virus spreading less likely.

A dearth of information about how the disease manifests in children makes reopening schools a potentially risky endeavor. Children may be just as likely to bring home the virus and should be taught to follow the same preventive measures to prevent the spread to others -- a particularly challenging feat since younger children are typically not as conscious of proper hygiene habits.

“It’s hard to make a definitive answer at this moment about children’s’ role in the transmission dynamic,” said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital and an ABC News contributor.

Experts agree that the virus affects children differently than it does adults. When children contract the virus, for example, they often show mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.

“The data suggests right now that children don’t get as sick as adults do,” Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of pediatrics and infectious disease at Stanford University, told ABC News. “We aren’t seeing a lot of hospitalizations [with children], and the ones we are seeing seem to be distinct from what the adults are experiencing.”

In response to an inquiry about Swaminathan’s comments, the Center for Disease Control issued a brief statement to ABC News.

""Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 the same way as adults, and they can infect others if they have it,” the statement reads. “Like adults, children may be infected but not have symptoms, and there is increasing evidence that people without symptoms may also spread the disease.""

So where does that leave us on the question of transmissibility?

While children may be at lower risk of feeling symptoms of the disease, they still play a key role in mitigating its spread. As Brownstein said, “every kid is a bridge to a vulnerable person,” and traditionally, with respiratory viruses, children’s behavior lends itself to disease proliferation.

“Generally, children are important vectors in respiratory virus epidemics because of congregation, hygiene,” Brownstein said. “They’re in schools.”",1

120,120,171,Bird lays off nearly a third of its staff during coronavirus pandemic,"Bird is laying off about 30 percent of its staff in response to the financial uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic. The layoffs, which were first reported by TechCrunch, are the first major staff cuts by a scooter startup since the pandemic first hit — but they are likely not to be the last.

The news comes after most of the major scooter sharing startups have said they would reduce or eliminate service in most major markets in response to the coronavirus pandemic. According to a memo from Bird CEO Travis VanderZanden published by TechCrunch, the layoffs were needed to ensure the company stays solvent until the end of 2021.

the layoffs were needed to ensure Bird stays solvent until the end of 2021

Laid off employees will be provided four weeks of pay, three months of health coverage, and an extra 12 months to exercise their stock options, TechCrunch reports.

With “shelter-in-place” orders, social distancing, and most people simply staying at home and avoiding unnecessary travel, scooter companies are seeing a steep drop in sales and demand. The timing of the pandemic is also posing a unique challenge for the money-losing scooter industry that sees its business slow down in the winter and pick back up again when the weather turns warm.

The pandemic notwithstanding, no startup has yet figured out how to earn a profit without relying on tens of millions of dollars in venture capital investment.

Bird’s main rival, Lime, is likely also considering worker reductions. The San Francisco-based company laid off 14 percent of its workforce last January and exited 12 markets, and a recent report in Bloomberg suggested that Lime is close to eliminating up to 70 more positions in response to the coronavirus. Another scooter startup, Wheels, recently laid off 6 percent of its employees.",1

Celebrities, activists, artists and students themselves recognized America's 3 million-plus graduating high school seniors in a widely broadcast ceremony on Saturday night, after the coronavirus crisis robbed the class of 2020 of a crucial milestone.

The virtual event, called Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020, carried a resounding message of community at a time when COVID-19 rules out the possibility of large gatherings.

In his commencement speech, former President Barack Obama told students that they've already faced big challenges to get to this point.

""Graduating is a big achievement under any circumstances. Some of you have had to overcome serious obstacles along the way,"" he said.

And just as seniors were ready to celebrate crossing the finish line, the coronavirus pandemic hit.

Acknowledging the new uncertainties introduced by the pandemic, Obama told the class of 2020 that the global health crisis would force them to grow up faster.

""When everything's up for grabs, this is your generation's world to shape,"" Obama said.

""This pandemic has shaken up the status quo and laid bare a lot of our country's deep-seated problems,"" he said, pointing to economic inequality, systemic racism and health care disparities.

The former president closed with a final piece of advice: Build a community.

""No one does big things by themselves,"" he said. ""If we're going to save the environment and defeat future pandemics, we're going to have to do it together. So be alive to one another's struggles. Stand up for one another's rights. Leave behind all the old ways of thinking that divide us.""

NBC YouTube

Basketball star LeBron James, whose activism has centered on primary education, flipped the ""stay home"" message spread during the public health crisis into a metaphorical one: ""Stay close to home.""

""Class of 2020, the world has changed. You will determine how we rebuild, and I ask that you make your community your priority,"" James said.

Megan Rapinoe, soccer player for the U.S. Women's National Team, told the seniors, ""I'm not gonna ask you to come together. I'm going to ask you to demand better.""

She encouraged students to vote in November, adding, ""Who is leading matters.""

Education activist Malala Yousafzai is also missing her graduation, after studying philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University.

She asked viewers to remember the young women in the world who won't be able to return to school because the coronavirus crisis pushed them into forced marriages and low-paying jobs.

""As you go out and change the world, don't leave them behind,"" she said.

The speeches were punctuated by students who thanked teachers, tributes from parents and plenty of TikTok clips.

Musicians stepped in front of green screens that featured videos of seniors dancing and playing instruments. Special appearances were made by Dua Lipa, H.E.R., Zendaya, Shaquille O'Neal, Yara Shahidi, Bad Bunny, Lena Waithe, Pharrell Williams and YBN Cordae.

Broadway star Ben Platt and his brothers, Henry and Jonah Platt, sang an a cappella medley of popular graduation anthems — supported by students' backing vocals — including Vitamin C's ""Graduation (Friends Forever)"" and the Beatles' ""In My Life.""

The Jonas Brothers closed out the show with a new song, ""X,"" featuring Karol G, joined by students dancing in sync via video.",1
51,51,87,Behind the Virus Report That Jarred the U.S. and the U.K. to Action,"
LONDON — When Boris Johnson was campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union in 2016 — a path that many experts warned would end in disaster for the country — one of his close allies, Michael Gove, famously declared that “people in this country have had enough of experts.”
Now, Mr. Gove and Mr. Johnson are leading the British government as it confronts the calamity of the coronavirus, and Mr. Johnson, now the prime minister, insists the process is being guided by experts. The trouble is, those experts can often disagree with each other or change their minds about the right course of action.
That messy back-and-forth has been on vivid display this week with the publication of a startling new report on the virus from a team at Imperial College in London. The report, which warned that an uncontrolled spread of the disease could cause as many as 510,000 deaths in Britain, triggered a sudden shift in the government’s comparatively relaxed response to the virus.
American officials said the report, which projected up to 2.2 million deaths in the United States from such a spread, also influenced the White House to strengthen its measures to isolate members of the public.
Imperial College has advised the government on its response to previous epidemics, including SARS, avian flu and swine flu. With ties to the World Health Organization and a team of 50 scientists, led by a prominent epidemiologist, Neil Ferguson, Imperial is treated as a sort of gold standard, its mathematical models feeding directly into government policies.
But outside experts pointed out that the report’s alarming conclusions — that the virus would overwhelm hospitals and that governments had no choice but to impose radical lockdown policies — had been made in previous reports on coronavirus or on social media sites devoted to the outbreak.
“A lot of it is not what they say, but who says it,” said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health governance program at Edinburgh University. “Neil Ferguson has a huge amount of influence.”
Imperial College, experts noted, was part of the advisory group for the government’s now-abandoned strategy, which played down radical social distancing and accepted that the infection would spread through the population. The theory is that this would build up so-called “herd immunity,” so that the public would be more resistant in the face of a second wave of infections next winter.
But such a strategy, the report noted, would lead to a flood of critically ill patients in a country without enough beds. Instead, it said, Britain needs to pursue “suppression,” which involves far stricter lockdowns, like the closing of schools and the quarantine of infected people and their families. That would drive down the number of cases and spread out the flow of patients over a longer period, allowing hospitals to cope.
Dr. Ferguson has been candid that the report reached new conclusions because of the latest data from Italy, which has seen a spiraling rate of infections, swamping hospitals and forcing doctors to make agonizing decisions about who to treat.
“The U.K. has struggled in the past few weeks in thinking about how to handle this outbreak long term,” Dr. Ferguson said in an interview on Monday, just after the report was released. “Based on our estimates and other teams’, there’s really no option but follow in China’s footsteps and suppress.”
The report added, “this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days, with the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 based on experience in Italy and the UK.”
But other experts said the burden on hospitals was clear as far back as the original outbreak in Wuhan, China. Lancet, the British medical journal, published an article in January, based on studying a small group of patients, which found that a third of people had to be admitted to intensive care units.
“I can’t help but feel angry that it has taken almost two months for politicians and even ‘experts’ to understand the scale of the danger from SARS-CoV-2,” said Richard Horton, the editor-in-chief of Lancet, on Twitter. “Those dangers were clear from the very beginning.”
Some said governments should treat the report’s projections about suppression policies with the same caution. It says social distancing measures might have to be imposed for 18 months or more, at least intermittently, until a vaccine is developed and tested. But the report acknowledges this is uncertain, given the possibility of drug treatments and the mystery of how the virus is transmitted.
“We’re all using the 1918 pandemic flu handbook,” Dr. Sridhar said. “But we’re in a different position than in 1918. We’re in 2020.”
After days of confusion about the wisdom of encouraging “herd immunity,” the government sought to play down the dispute, arguing that this was not a deliberate part of its strategy but a byproduct of it. But it shifted to a policy of urging people not to go to pubs, restaurants, theaters or museums.
On Tuesday, the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he expected these new, more stringent restrictions to last for months — and that the authorities would have to monitor very carefully what would happen when they are eventually lifted.
British officials recognize that their health service faces a moment of truth. All non-urgent operations in England will be postponed for at least three months, starting April 15, to free up 30,000 beds to help tackle the coronavirus.
Britain lags behind other European nations in its supply of ventilators. Plans are underway to ramp up their numbers from over 8,000 to 12,000, though officials are reluctant to promise that even this is sufficient.
Underscoring the change in tone, Britain’s finance chief, Rishi Sunak, announced a gargantuan fiscal stimulus to salvage reeling British businesses and to try to stem job losses. The package, worth £330 billion, or $422 billion, will include government-backed loans and tax breaks for companies and a three-month break in mortgage repayments for strapped homeowners.
“We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this,” said Mr. Sunak, who also promised support for airports and airlines in the coming days, after Britons were advised against all non-essential travel.
Mr. Johnson hinted on Tuesday that schools could be closed soon. But he still faces criticism for a lack of clarity, including his decision to urge people to avoid pubs and restaurants but not to order their closing. In fact, the government now intends to relax laws to allow pubs to stay open and produce takeout food.
To Mr. Johnson’s embarrassment, one of those promising to visit his local pub was his own father, Stanley Johnson.Sheri Fink contributed to this report from New York.",1
186,186,254,Brexit trade deal gets tougher as coronavirus strikes officials on both sides,"The Brexit trade deal will face greater challenges ahead as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is now in intensive care because of the coronavirus, while other key negotiators have either been infected or are in self-isolation.

The U.K. finally left the European Union on Jan. 31, but it remains in a transition period and has a deadline of end 2020 to set a free-trade deal with the EU. Now, whether Britain would be able to meet that deadline is in question.

""In all circumstances it's very difficult to imagine how some sort of large scale trade deal between the U.K. and the EU gets done by the end of the year,"" Amanda Sloat, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution, told CNBC on Tuesday.

""In the last couple weeks, we've seen EU's Brexit negotiator get coronavirus, the British negotiator has also been showing symptoms and now of course this very sad situation with the prime minister,"" she added. On March 19, Europe's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also announced he had been infected, while U.K. negotiator David Frost went into self-isolation around the same time after showing symptoms.

Johnson, 55, was moved to intensive care on Monday as his coronavirus symptoms worsened over the course of several hours, according to a statement from the government. He had announced on March 27 that he tested positive and was experiencing ""mild symptoms.""

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will temporarily take over the prime minister's duties while Johnson is hospitalized, the government said.

""Clearly with this move into intensive care, there is a desire to put extra precautions into place, (Johnson) clearly is not in a position to govern at the moment,"" Sloat said.",1

Hundreds of thousands have died and millions of cases have been reported worldwide in the covid-19 pandemic, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The United States is now the outbreakâs epicenter, with more recorded deaths and reported infections than any other country.

Several countries are confirming thousands of new cases of covid-19 each day, led by the United States, where testing was slow to begin.

On March 31, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the pandemic âthe most challenging crisis we have faced since the Second World War.â

The disease, which can trigger severe respiratory symptoms, has been reported on every continent except Antarctica and in at least 180 countries. The World Health Organization declared covid-19 a pandemic on March 11.

The U.S. total of reported cases is by far the highest in the world. Covid-19 has been confirmed in every state and in most U.S. territories. As more tests are performed, many states are seeing rapid growth in the number of known cases.

In the early months, China, where the outbreak originated last year, reported more cases than any other country. Its tally of new infections peaked in mid-February and approached zero by mid-March, although questions surround the accuracy of its data.

While the virus appears to have plateaued or declined in much of Europe, many countries in South America, South Asia and the Middle East have reported increases in the number of cases.

As the disease waned in China, it began to surge in Italy and Spain. By May, more than 150,000 people had died throughout Europe.

Coronaviruses range from some common cold viruses to those that cause much more serious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Some strains spread more efficiently than others; the virus that causes covid-19 seems to spread easily from person to person, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

404,404,500,Tesla turns a profit and says it may hit 2020 delivery goals despite pandemic,"Tesla turned a surprise profit in the first quarter of 2020 of $16 million, despite factory shutdowns in China and the US, the company announced on Wednesday. It said it may still hit its goal of delivering 500,000 vehicles worldwide this year even in the face of the pandemic. It’s the first time in Tesla’s history that the company has turned in three consecutive profitable quarters.

There are, of course, caveats to those statements. Tesla sold $354 million worth of regulatory credits in the quarter, a record for the company. And while Tesla said it has the capacity to beat that 500,000 delivery goal, the company admitted that it “remains uncertain how quickly we and our suppliers will be able to ramp production after resuming operations.”

It wasn’t necessarily just financial engineering that helped Tesla turn the quarterly profit, which is just its fifth in the last three years. Tesla had already announced that it was able to keep delivery and production numbers up during the first quarter despite facing the early impacts of the pandemic.

The Tesla Semi is delayed to 2021

The Model Y also started shipping this past quarter (ahead of schedule, no less), and Tesla says it’s already making the company money, marking the “first time in [Tesla’s] history that a new product has been profitable in its first quarter.” That’s not only because the Model Y shares 75 percent of its parts with the Model 3, but also because Tesla is using some of the Model 3’s production lines to build the Model Y.

The company also generated $5.9 billion in revenue, which is an increase of nearly $1.5 billion compared to its first quarter performance in 2019 and about $100 million higher than was expected from Wall Street analysts. Tesla says it made a gross margin of 25.5 percent on its vehicles, which is the highest that figure’s been since the height of the ramp-up of Model 3 production. The company finished the quarter with $8.1 billion of cash.

Not everything is going according to plan, however. Tesla said on Wednesday that it is delaying the first deliveries of the Tesla Semi truck to 2021. The Tesla Semi was first revealed back in November 2017, though its development has taken a back seat to products with broader appeal and more immediate bang for the company’s buck.

And while Tesla’s new factory in China is back up and running, the company’s main automotive plant in California has been shut down for all of April, meaning that the company’s second quarter results are likely to look a lot worse than the ones announced on Wednesday. Tesla has already furloughed hundred, if not thousands, of workers and cut salaries across the company as a result.

Elon Musk is “worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area”

To that end, shortly before the company announced the first quarter results, public health officials in the San Francisco Bay Area announced that they’re extending the shelter-in-place order for the region through May 31st. While some businesses are allowed to reopen, automotive manufacturing is still not considered to be an “essential business,” according to the revised text of the order.

Tesla resisted the shelter-in-place order when it was first announced in mid-March. The company said at the time, to both employees and local officials, that it was told by the Department of Homeland Security that it was deemed “national critical infrastructure,” despite the fact that other automakers were suspending their operations at the time.

“We are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area, and that should be identified as a serious risk,” Musk said on a call with investors Wednesday night. He then went on to call the orders “fascist” and said that local governments around the country are “forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against their constitutional rights in my opinion, and breaking people’s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong.”

487,487,598,Credit card applications have dropped by 40% amid coronavirus—here's when to apply for a new card,"When consumers face economic hardship, opening a new credit card may be a helpful option to get by. But surprisingly, many Americans aren't taking this approach during the global coronavirus pandemic. New credit card applications were down 40% from the first week of March to the last week, according to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Consumer Credit Panel. The report looked at hard inquiry data, or the number of times consumers' credit was pulled for an application. Results revealed that the credit card industry is not the only one seeing a drop; auto loan inquiries have decreased by 52% and mortgage inquiries by 27%. What's a hard inquiry? Each time you apply for credit, the lender will perform a ""hard inquiry"" or ""soft inquiry."" Hard inquiries are the most common and appear on your credit report after you submit an application, which may ding your credit score temporarily. Meanwhile, soft inquiries have no effect on your credit. The CFPB cited that this sharp drop in new inquiries could be due to a lowered demand for credit (people are spending less), or a drop in credit supply that may indirectly or directly raise consumers' expectation of being turned down for credit. In other words — consumers expect it will be harder to qualify for credit or a loan, given the number of banks scaling back on lending during the market's current conditions.

Why people with higher credit scores are applying for fewer cards

Suprisingly, card applications declined significantly more for consumers with super prime scores (above a 780 VantageScore) compared to consumers with deep subprime scores (below 500), at a rate of 59% and 34%, respectively. The CFPB pointed out that while all types of inquiries declined notably, consumers with higher credit scores had the most substantial drop. This could indicate they have more flexibility in substituting new credit applications with other means of financial support, such as emergency savings or passive income. Regardless if you have savings or not, you may still want to apply for a credit card. A new card can provide an extended credit limit, which is something you may need if you've recently been laid off or had your credit limit reduced without notice. It could also reward you with cash back for stocking up on groceries and streaming Netflix. But before you apply for a new credit card, we review some tips below.

When to apply for a new credit card

1369,1376,1899,‘NO QUESTION’ US in COLD WAR 2 with China – Florida senator,"The US is “absolutely” engaged in a new Cold War with China, Florida Senator Rick Scott declared, accusing Beijing of plotting “world domination.” Meanwhile, Washington’s anti-China stance goes all the way to the White House.

Speaking to talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Friday, the Florida Republican slammed Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and its economic policies. Asked whether relations between the two superpowers had entered a “Cold War 2” phase, Scott replied “absolutely.”

“There’s no question about it,” he said. “They’re in for world domination. They take our jobs, they take our technology, they put people in prison for their religion.”

“Understand you have an enemy,” he continued. “They’re an adversary. It’s called Communist China. They’re not here to help us, all right?”

Scott called Beijing’s decision not to alert the World Health Organization about the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan until January “intentional,” and suggested a boycott of Chinese-made products until the east Asian superpower is held “accountable.”

The Floridian lawmaker, who sits on the Senate’s Armed Services and Homeland Security committees, then called for the US to sanction China “for violating Hong Kong’s independence."" China, on the other hand, has accused the US of deliberately stoking protest in the semi-autonomous city-state.

Scott’s anti-China broadsides are not the musings of a single Republican war-hawk. Instead, they represent a growing consensus in the US, with bills threatening Beijing with sanctions being introduced and a number of Republican saying they will sue the Chinese administration for its alleged role in the coronavirus pandemic. That’s as President Donald Trump has been raging at China throughout the pandemic, suggesting that Covid-19 was cooked up in a Chinese laboratory, and threatening to “cut off the whole relationship” with Beijing.

Trump’s outburst was likely hyperbolic, but the official line coming from the White House is equally uncompromising. In a policy document outlining its strategic approach to China, the White House this week revealed a “fundamental re-evaluation of how the United States understands and responds to the leaders of the world’s most populous country.”

Accusing China of “predatory economic practices” and “malign behaviors” that undermine national security, the document stated that the US is now engaged in “long-term strategic competition” with Beijing, and will orient its military toward this competition, and toward supporting its “regional allies and partners” in the Pacific. And all of this on top of the Pentagon prioritizing China as an adversary in 2018.

Beijing’s responses, meanwhile, have been subtler. In Hong Kong, it has sought to portray the US as meddling in its affairs, and the conflict between protesters and mainland authorities as an internal matter. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, China has threatened to respond with “painful” countermeasures if Congress applies sanctions or files lawsuits. Globally, as the US continues to deal with more than a million active cases of Covid-19, China has gone on a charm offensive, shipping test kits and protective equipment to the worst-hit countries in Europe.

Militarily though, Beijing continues to pump money into hypersonic weapons and artificial intelligence research – two areas in which it has the edge on America. Its navy has also not been deterred by American patrols in the South China Sea, and continues to assert sovereignty over this hotly disputed tract of water.

1182,1182,1498,Merkel’s milestone moment,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1
1109,1109,1337,"What is a pulse oximeter, and does the coronavirus pandemic mean you need one?","Typically clipped over a finger (though a toe or ear lobe works, too), a pulse oximeter transmits light from sensors on one side of the device through the body part to sensors on the other side. In about 15 seconds, it calculates how much oxygen is being transported through the person’s bloodstream and displays the results as a percentage (abbreviated SpO₂). Doctors consider a SpO₂ reading of 94 percent and higher to be normal. Low levels of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia) can lead to low levels of oxygen in the tissue and organs (hypoxia), which can lead to death.

Pulse oximeters are usually purchased for home use by people who want or need to monitor their oxygen supply, including patients with chronic lung conditions such as COPD, performance athletes or people living at high altitude. Shortly after the pandemic began, however, the easy-to-use devices started being touted as a means to detect serious complications from covid-19, the disease the virus causes.





“The reason there is such great interest pulse oximeters now is that covid-19 has a fairly significant effect on the body’s ability to oxygenate, sometimes discordant with how the patient feels,” says Benjamin Seides, director of interventional pulmonology at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield, Ill., outside Chicago. Though patients aren’t especially short of breath, their low blood oxygen levels may indicate they are headed for a crisis.

Seides said an idea started to spread: Maybe if physicians told people to watch their blood oxygen levels, they could contact a doctor or go to the emergency room if their saturation levels dramatically dipped. That prompted a run on the devices.

Sales data provided to The Washington Post from Bloomreach, an e-commerce software firm, shows that U.S. sales of fingertip pulse oximeters increased by 506 percent over the previous week during the week of Feb. 17 and 168 percent over that week during the week of Feb. 24. Since that time, demand held fairly steady and then tapered off the first two weeks of April. But in recent weeks, sales again have started to climb, perhaps as consumers prepare for the next phase of living with the pandemic. In mid-May, the devices were still sold out, delayed or on back order in stores such as Walgreens, CVS and Target.





Medical-grade pulse oximeters cost $200 or more, but consumers can find them for about $50 at pharmacies, big-box stores and online. Even the lower-cost versions are considered a fast and reliable way to measure how well you are oxygenating.

Correct usage is key to a trustworthy reading, however, which can fluctuate based on a number of factors — what you are doing physically (sitting versus running), proper device placement and the altitude you live at. Artificial nails and nail polish, especially gel-based, can produce inaccurate measurements of SpO₂, as they block the light transmission. Cold hands or poor circulation can also interfere with the light and produce false numbers, because pulse oximeters need a steady flow of blood beneath the sensor.

Pulmonologist Federico Cerrone, managing physician at Overlook Medical Center in Summit, N.J., says people with chronic health issues may want to get a pulse oximeter at this time because it can be a helpful tool for regularly checking in with a doctor via telemedicine. Patients with covid-19 who are discharged from a hospital also may be given a pulse oximeter so they can monitor their numbers to see if they are improving or getting worse.





“It can be a reassurance or a harbinger of issues indicating you may need to return to the hospital,” Cerrone says.

Unless you have an underlying condition or are recovering from covid-19, however, you probably don’t need to add one to your collection of home health supplies.

“It’s a convenience, not a necessity. If you are short of breath or have a cough, you can usually call your physician and have a drive-through check of your oxygenation,” says Cerrone.

He also cautions against the use of oximeter apps that purport to tell you various medical readings because their performance has not been validated in scientific studies. A recent University of Oxford study found no evidence that any smartphone technology is accurate for the measurement of blood oxygen saturation. In fact, the study states, “oxygen saturation levels obtained from such technologies should not be trusted.”





There are potential drawbacks to widespread usage of pulse oximeters. Seides says that some patients who possess them become compulsive and check their saturation levels too often. “In the hands of nervous patients, the device creates anxiety and confusion without much probative value, because even with a small dip in readings they call their physician. It’s important to recognize that a pulse oximeter is a single data point of a complete picture.”

Another concern is that those who use a pulse oximeter as a covid-19 litmus test may ignore other troubling signs.

“I worry that though their saturation numbers look okay, people with other symptoms such a shortness of breath or persistent cough won’t seek medical attention,” says Seides.



Physicians agree that during this pandemic, the important actions remain physical distancing, washing hands, wearing a mask, listening to public health officials and, if you’re not feeling well, calling your doctor.",1
857,857,1027,YouTube and Instagram influencers share their playbooks for making money despite the ad downturn,"The ad business has been hurting for influencers in recent weeks as brands cut marketing budgets to save on costs or to avoid appearing tone-deaf during the coronavirus pandemic.

Business Insider spoke to several influencers across multiple categories on how they are making money despite the ad downturn.

Creators shared the top ways they've been earning – from selling merchandise to creating subscription-based memberships and driving commission sales.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Many influencers are still earning revenue this year despite a sharp downturn in sponsored post deals from brands.

Some have adjusted the types of content they make to account for new consumer taste during the coronavirus pandemic. Audiences on social media aren't searching for the same content as before, but they are still active, growing quickly, and hungry for information that's relevant to life at home.

Travel influencer Christina Vidal, who has 85,000 Instagram followers, began to notice her readership dip in mid-March, she told Business Insider.

To bring back her audience, Vidal has been leaning into other content verticals like food and lifestyle. She studied Google search results to identify what topics were trending and has customized her posts to increase their likelihood of showing up in those searches.

Alongside shifting content, creators have also had to change up their business models and move away from ad-supported revenue streams as brands cut marketing budgets. Sponsored posts fell from representing 35% of influencer posts in mid-February to 4% of creator content in mid-April, according to a report from the marketing-analytics firm Launchmetrics.

While sponsored content has long been a predictable (and essential) source of income for digital creators, the industry offers a variety of other revenue streams like merchandise, direct-to-consumer products, and content production deals that creators are leaning into.

The biggest factor propping up the influencer industry in recent weeks is a spike in consumer demand for social content, which is stronger than ever.

TikTok just broke a record for the most app downloads in a single quarter and Instagram influencers have reported a large bump in user engagement on the app's Stories and Live features, following a broader trend toward more live content consumption on platforms like Twitch and Facebook. Google reported a year-over-year spike in YouTube viewership during its first-quarter earnings call.

The influencer economy hasn't been destroyed by the advertising meltdown, as creators make money from merch, subscriptions, and even personalized shout-outs



Direct ad revenue from YouTube and sponsored content can prove unreliable, so many influencers are getting smart about finding ways to diversify.

Some influencers have larger business ventures, like YouTube creator Preston Arsement, who is also the CEO of the digital-media studio TBNR, which Forbes estimated earned $14 million before taxes from June 2018 to June 2019. Others sell consumer products like makeup, merchandise, or books that have the potential to become New York Times bestsellers.

Some of the new ways creators have been turning their followers into paying customers (especially while social distancing) are by sending personalized video messages to fans through the app Cameo or by creating a subscription-based membership program through Patreon.

""For the first time in history, every athlete, actor, creator, comedian, and musician is suddenly sitting on the couch,"" Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said. ""Their events are being canceled and all that revenue and fan interaction that they get is just suddenly gone. Talent are coming on and giving it a try because suddenly they aren't busy or making as much money as before.""

We broke down all of the main ways creators are making money without ads. Read how services like Patreon and influencer-led products like branded merchandise are helping creators here:

Travel influencers have been leaning into other content verticals like food and lifestyle to reach wider audiences

Many influencers, like Vidal, who primarily work in the travel category, said they have had to drastically change their businesses.

To stay afloat financially, she decided to pivot and focus on what her audience would be more interested in right now, like easy recipes and a quarantine gift-giving guide.

""I focus on luxury travel, and that is definitely not what people were thinking about in mid-to-late March and in all of April,"" she told Business Insider. ""I immediately was like, 'OK, if people aren't reading about travel, I need to write about other things.'""

Vidal is not alone in having to make changes to her content in recent weeks.

Business Insider spoke with several travel influencers on which strategies they were focusing on to continue to earn revenue and build up readership, more here:

For some YouTube creators, merchandise sales have made up for a loss in ad revenue

YouTube creator Michael Groth, who has 1 million subscribers, told Business Insider that the average rate YouTube paid him began dropping sharply at the end of March.

Creators like Groth can earn money in a number of ways, including direct-to-consumer sales and brand sponsorships. But for many, direct YouTube revenue makes up a big chunk of their income.

""I've known for a while that YouTube AdSense can do crazy stuff like this,"" Groth said. ""I've made efforts to diversify over the years. My diversification has never surpassed my YouTube AdSense earnings because my AdSense earnings have been pretty healthy, but that may change now.""

Business Insider spoke to YouTubers on how their average rates have changed and how they are adapting their digital businesses. Here's what they said: Some YouTube creators say their ad rates have dropped sharply in recent weeks and increased views haven't made up for the loss in income Arsement said he had switched his focus to gaming content he could easily film from home and had been leaning into direct sales from his merchandise business. He said his CPM rate had dropped by over 50% since the coronavirus outbreak began, but merchandise sales had made up for that loss in revenue by nearly tripling. Arsement has been selling T-shirts, hoodies, and other branded accessories to make up for lost revenue. He also launched a new channel. Check out what he did to capitalize on the increased YouTube viewership here: How a YouTube star making an estimated $14 million per year has adapted his business in recent weeks, as ad rates drop by over 50% but merch sales nearly triple Some influencers are being paid for their content creation skills rather than their 'influence' As production companies shut down photo and video shoots in order to adhere to social-distancing measures, some marketers have been turning to influencers for their content creation skills. Many influencers have worked from home for years and are already equipped with the production gear necessary to create commercial content for brands. ""For the first time, big brands aren't able to make those big budget television ads,"" said Karyn Spencer, the senior vice president of partnerships at Whalar, an influencer-marketing agency. ""You don't need that full-blown production anymore. YouTubers taught us that.""

Live-video marketing on social-media platforms has long been a revenue driver for Twitch gamers and other streamers who have pitched brands on their sizable recurring live audiences. But as interest in live content spreads to other social-media platforms like Instagram — which traditionally has focused on posed photos and videos — more influencers and brands have been experimenting with the format as a marketing opportunity. ""People are more apt to spend 30, 60, or 90 minutes on an influencer or branded livestream, whereas they're typically only engaging with a static photo on a feed for a couple seconds,"" said Ellie Jenkins, an influencer-innovation manager at Mavrck.

The ad industry is going through a massive transformation, which has been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic.

To chart out how companies are navigating through these challenges, Business Insider is launching a regular series where chief marketing officers take us through how they are using data, taking work in-house, creating new models with their agencies and tweaking their campaigns.

In the first installment, Greg Lyons, CMO at PepsiCo Beverages North America, discussed how Pepsi was investing in data and e-commerce in the long-term and shifting marketing budgets to operations in the short-term.

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Tanya Dua: How has the pandemic changed the way you operate?

Greg Lyons: We're making more end-to-end decisions as a business, and less decisions as a marketing department in a silo. Decisions that was sometimes take weeks or months to make, we're making much more quickly now. The business is changing so fast, we've created some special projects to make us stronger coming out of this, and we're moving people around more than before to make sure that everyone's working on something that's valuable to the organization.

E-commerce is a big long-term focus for Pepsi

Dua: Can you share some of these projects?

Lyons: We saw that more people were buying food and beverages online than before so we shifted some of our marketing investment into e-commerce. E-commerce is a big growth platform for us, and [the pandemic] has probably accelerated that shift by three to five years. I'm talking the pure plays, like Amazon and Instacart, but also the click-and-collects like Walmart.com and Kroger.

Dua: Is Frito-Lay's e-commerce website Snacks.com that just launched part of that investment?



Lyons: We're trying to learn if product bundles make sense. And if they do, then do morning bundles, which have got a whole bunch of different PepsiCo products in them, make sense? I view it mostly as something small as opposed to a big new business opportunity for us.

Dua: How has your use of data changed?

Lyons: We've got first-party data for well over 25 million households, and we're trying to use that to make informed decisions in our marketing. Earlier, we'd have a code under the cap, and you could register your name to win a cool prize, and we'd have a database where we'd capture that data for the Pepsi brand. We'd do a different promotion on Doritos around gaming and capture that, and have data there. We weren't sharing that data across all the brands.

Over the last five years, we've become much more proactive in trying to get consumers' data in one usable data set. We're asking them if they want to hear from us and honoring that, making sure that it's robust enough so we understand how often people want to hear from us, what's important to them, and which brands they interact with the most. We're overlaying on top this idea of really understanding consumers not just as a data point but as humans.

Pepsi has changed its marketing and the scope of work for its agencies in the face of the pandemic

Dua: In a survey called ""The Empathy Imperative,"" Pepsi found 80% of customers say it's important that brands revise the tone or style of their advertising and communications during this time. How are you doing that?



Lyons: We had an ongoing summer campaign planned called ""#Summergram,"" which was about people going outside and enjoying summer with their friends and family. It would be tone-deaf right now if you got a bottle of Pepsi that said ""Suns out, Buns out."" So we've culled that. We also had some advertising that showed people enjoying themselves at basketball games, and that wasn't the right thing to show either. Instead, we're doing other types of marketing.



Dua: Like what?

Lyons: We partnered with the Global Citizen Festival on their ""One World Together"" event with Lady Gaga, and tried to help them however we could, whether it was designing the logo for the event or artist outreach, production or generating awareness. We partnered with John Krasinski on his show ""Some Good News,"" helping Guy Fieri help restaurant workers. We donated $3 million and became part of that show, and gave some people something to feel good about — in an authentic way — because Pepsi is part of a lot of restaurant experiences and we want to help those restaurants and those employees.

Dua: How has that impacted your marketing budget?



Lyons: It's very important to not go dark during this time. We made the decision to pause a fair amount of our media in the second quarter to help make sure that our business operations, our employees on our frontline, were safe. We took some of our marketing money and invested a little bit more in our operations. We've also increased their [operations staff] pay a little bit. We're still marketing our brands, but we've simplified our calendar. We think the ROI is going to be higher when the country reopens, so we're trying to keep as much flexibility with our marketing money as we possibly can in the third and fourth quarters.

Dua: How has that flexibility impacted your relationship with your agencies?



Lyons: It's very difficult to be an agency right now, as a lot of clients are cutting their spend. We're trying to be understanding of what they're going through. We're trying to be as transparent with them as possible as to where we're going to need their help. Depending on the agency, what they are working on, and how our plans have changed, we've changed scopes of work. We have not changed our payment terms. We need flexibility because things could change. If we have a big second wave [of the pandemic], our plans will probably be different than if we have a balanced recovery.

Dua: Do you think in-housing will accelerate as a result of the coronavirus?



Lyons: We've had some in-house creative capabilities for a while, and we used that team to create some of the awareness-building tactics that we did for the Global Citizen partnership. That being said, I do not think it accelerates in-housing. We need both agency partners that bring fresh thinking, real expertise in creative, and broad perspective across lots of brands and the industry, as well as in-house creative that can do things very quickly and be a creative resource for us.



Dua: What's your stance on blacklisting news during the crisis?



Lyons: During this pandemic, we have decided not to advertise on hard news, because we feel that it's depressing right now. But I would not call that blacklisting — we've just chosen not to do that for the time being.",1
133,133,186,FDA OKs Addition To Stockpile Of Malaria Drugs For COVID-19,"FDA OKs Addition To Stockpile Of Malaria Drugs For COVID-19

Enlarge this image toggle caption Photo Illustration by John Phillips/Getty Images Photo Illustration by John Phillips/Getty Images

Over the weekend, the Food and Drug Administration granted two malaria drugs ""emergency use authorization"" for the treatment of COVID-19. The move makes it easier to add the medicines to the strategic stockpile, which can be drawn upon in the current public health emergency.

The drugs — chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine — have been identified as potential COVID-19 treatments based on lab tests and small, limited studies in humans.

But gold standard clinical trials in the United States only just got underway. Preliminary results from those studies aren't expected for weeks or months.

One thing is for sure, the FDA decision doesn't reflect an official determination that the drugs work against the coronavirus.

""This is not FDA approval of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19,"" says infectious diseases physician Rajesh Gandhi, who is leading Massachusetts General Hospital's COVID-19 treatment task force. ""There's an epidemic of misinformation out there, and we need to combat that.""

The emergency use authorization only applies to the supply of these two drugs in the Strategic National Stockpile, the government's storehouses of emergency medical supplies located in warehouses throughout the country.

Hospitals would need to request access to the drugs through their states, and the medicines would only be distributed to patients who have been hospitalized and tested positive for COVID-19, but for whom a ""clinical trial is not available, or participation is not feasible,"" according to the FDA.

""It's nice to know that they have it in the event we're running low or going to run out,"" says Onisis Stefas, chief pharmacy officer at Northwell Health in New York, where doctors are already using the drug for patients who can't be enrolled in clinical trials. ""It's good to have this as backup.""

The emergency use authorization won't affect patients seeking this drug from their local pharmacies, where shortages have been reported.

Sandoz, the generic and biosimilar arm of drugmaker Novartis, donated 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to the stockpile. Bayer Pharmaceuticals donated 1 million doses of chloroquine. The Department of Health and Human Services announced on Sunday that it accepted these doses ""for possible use in treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19 or for use in clinical trials.""

President Trump began promoting both drugs at his daily coronavirus press briefings earlier this month, prompting a spike in hydroxychloroquine prescriptions and concern about shortages and accidental poisonings.

If the drugs were helpful, doctors would be pleased to have a treatment option.

""We were told patients with COVID-19 who received this drug cleared the virus better than patients that did not receive the drug,"" says Francois Nosten, who directs the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit in Thailand and has been working with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for decades. ""But it's not sufficient information to be sure that this drug can be used or should be used in treating patients more widely.""

Preliminary findings often don't pan out.

""The whole history of infectious disease is littered with drugs we all thought were going to be promising but turned out ... not to be,"" Mass General's Gandhi says, adding that some of these medicines even turned out to be harmful.",1

Pritzker, facing daily criticisms from Republican legislators and the more than a million Illinoisans who are unemployed during the pandemic, signaled some hope for the Northeast region of his reopening plan, which includes Cook, the collar counties — and counties that aren’t too happy to be in that region, including Grundee and Kankakee.

For the first time on Thursday, the state’s Northeast region met the medical benchmarks set by the Pritzker administration to potentially move from the second phase of the reopening plan to the third phase. That would allow some additional businesses to resume operations on a limited basis when the current stay-at-home order expires May 29.

Those metrics include a 19.9% testing positivity rate for the Northeast region, just barely hitting the 20% standard required by Pritzker’s office over a two-week period.

“Remember, they need to go through a time period, and there needs to be an averaging of those metrics,” Pritzker said.

All other regions previously had been on track to enter the third phase and are still in line to do so.

Meanwhile, health officials said another 138 people have died of COVID-19 in Illinois, raising the state’s death toll to 3,928. And newly reported 3,239 cases are among the 22,678 test results received by the state a day earlier.

In total, there have been 87,937 coronavirus cases confirmed in 99 of Illinois’ 102 counties since the pandemic hit the state.

More than 512,000 people have been tested overall, with the state’s rolling positive rate over the last week at about 17%, officials said.

With the latest cases reported on Thursday, Cook County overtook Queens County, New York, which reported 58,084 as of Thursday, according to data kept by Johns Hopkins University.

Cook County added 2,051 cases over the last 24 hours compared to 336 for Queens, which has fewer than half the number of residents compared to Cook County but a much higher population density.

But Illinois Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike called the increase in cases “a function of increasing our testing.

“No one has captured all cases of COVID-19 — they have captured all cases for which people have been tested,” Ezike said. “This is getting us closer to the actual numbers, but we’re far, far, far from having the actual numbers.”",1
1135,1135,1377,The need to go is a big barrier to going out. Why public bathrooms are a stumbling block for reopening.,"It’s a hurdle vexing many business owners as they prepare to reopen in a time of social distancing, reduced capacity and heightened anxiety about the very air we breathe.



A Texas barbecue restaurant reopened only after hiring for a new job category: a bathroom monitor, who assures that people waiting their turn are spaced well apart. In Florida, malls are installing touch-free sinks and hand dryers in restrooms before opening their doors. McDonald’s is requiring franchisees to clean bathrooms every 30 minutes. Across the country, businesses are replacing blow dryers with paper towels, decommissioning urinals that now seem too close together, and removing restroom doors to create airport-style, no-touch entrances.



In San Luis Obispo, Calif., the Sunset Drive-In held back from reopening even though the health department gave it the green light because the owner needed time to figure out how to address customers’ concerns about catching the novel coronavirus in the bathroom.

“Before we open, we want to have the restroom problem solved for your safety,” the owner, Larry Rodkey, wrote on Facebook. “Sitting through approximately five hours of movies is a necessity for the enjoyment of the Drive-In.”

The theater reopened over the weekend with extra employees to disinfect the bathrooms every 30 minutes and limits on queuing up.

The Aut-O-Rama Twin Drive-In theater in North Ridgeville, Ohio, reopened this week with 10 portable toilets added to the eight existing stalls, even though movie attendance was limited to 25 percent of the usual capacity. On its marquee facing the highway, the theater touted the advantages of outdoor, in-car movie watching: “Social Distancing Since 1965.”





Owner Deb Sherman has instituted new policies, leaving plenty of space between cars, requiring masks and enforcing six-foot distancing in the restrooms.

“Anyone not following established safe policies set forth may be asked to leave the theatre without a refund,” the policy reads.

She doubled her staff from 10 to 20 to keep queues to a minimum and let customers see that someone was constantly disinfecting the restrooms and concessions stand.

“If we can give them some confidence about safety, people are ready to get out of the house and try and have a little more normal life,” she said. “The restroom situation didn’t bother me personally, but it was the number one concern people had on our Facebook page, so I had to take action to make them comfortable.”



Such comfort might be hard-won. Laura Maxwell is eager to find an entertainment option that would let her take her children, ages 11 and 13, out of the house safely. Maxwell, who lives in San Luis Obispo, would happily return to the Sunset Drive-In, but the prospect of restroom queues is bothersome.



“Bathrooms are a problem,” she said. “They’re huge contact places, and if you’re shedding the virus, it’ll be all over. Maybe they could just open up without bathrooms and people would know in advance and make the decision not to go, or to wear Depends.”

Solutions to people’s anxieties might not be quite so simple, said Steven Soifer, president of the American Restroom Association, which advocates for safer and more private public bathrooms.



“Americans have always had a fear of contamination from public restrooms,” said Soifer, who also is a professor of social work at the University of Mississippi. “What we’re seeing now is part just heightened anxiety, but it’s also part reality-based. Public restrooms in this country generally have open toilet seats — no lids — and high-pressure flushes create a plume of droplets that extends at least six feet.”

The coronavirus has been found in human waste up to a month after a victim has recovered. And a study published last week concluded that droplets from human speaking can hang in the air for at least eight minutes.

Soifer’s group seeks a retooling of public facilities that would place toilets inside fully enclosed unisex stalls, as is more common in Europe and parts of Asia. There would be larger dividers separating urinals.





“In our country, people aren’t comfortable talking about bathroom issues in general,” Soifer said. “The old frontier mentality and the emphasis on personal liberty has led to an attitude where there’s no standard for public restrooms other than the building code. Now we need to extend social distancing to restrooms, and it’s going to be very hard. Even if you limit the number of stalls, you then create a line of people outside.”

Makers of bathroom fixtures have seen a surge of restaurant owners and workplace managers ordering thorough renovations of their bathrooms — a level of attention unusual in a country where many public restrooms haven’t moved much higher up the design ladder than the stereotypically awful gas station bathroom.

“People are converting to fixtures with touchless features,” said Jon Dommisse, director of strategy for Bradley Corp., a Wisconsin-based maker of workplace washroom equipment. “They’re swapping out faucets, dryers, anything with buttons, levers, knobs. They’re reducing the number of people allowed in at a time, taking doors off and adding wash stations outside the bathroom to relieve crowding. Most of all, we’re seeing a commitment to almost relentless levels of cleaning.”

Bradley regularly conducts national surveys about bathrooms, and even in good times, 76 percent of Americans say they’ve had memorably bad experiences in public restrooms. The latest survey, conducted last month, found that 91 percent of consumers want touchless fixtures in bathrooms, Dommisse said, “a number we’ve never seen before.”





Going away: Push-button soap dispensers, and those high-velocity hand dryers that can blow germs across an entire room. Coming to a restroom near you: More copper fixtures — copper has antimicrobial properties — and dryers integrated into the sink so no one walks across the room dripping water.

“Maybe the multi-stall restroom is obsolete,” said Michelle Kempen, an interior designer at Kahler Slater, an architecture firm in Milwaukee. “With covid, we’re moving toward a more European model, where the WC is a single room and then you go out into a shared sink area, along with touchless design and maybe a return to restroom attendants.”

Having an employee present at all times, she said, makes cleaning ongoing and evident.

But employees cost money, and the bill for retooling a restroom can be $25,000 or more — McDonald’s is leaving it to franchise owners to foot the bill for $718 touchless sinks and $310 sensor-activated towel dispensers. Quick fixes are likely to be cheaper, such as a return to paper towels, additional signage and one-way foot traffic.

Some businesses now want cleaning done by day rather than when they’re closed so customers and employees can see the company taking cleaning seriously, said Michelle Goret, a spokeswoman for Cintas, an Ohio-based supplier of restroom services.





“To further ease consumer anxiety around restrooms, our customers are also more interested in providing proof of service,” Goret said. “We’ve even had some customers film our technicians performing a deep clean to share with their customers and employees.”

Figuring out what might restore consumer confidence is more art than science. In a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll this month, 78 percent said they would be uncomfortable eating at a sit-down restaurant. The results were similar whether people lived in a state that is opening up businesses or one still operating under tight restrictions.

In South Florida, where many stores are reopening, the Bal Harbour Shops mall hired 14 extra people to clean. Restaurants will move their seating outdoors, but customers still need to go inside to use the restrooms, which are being renovated to include automatic doors, touchless sinks and dryers.

In Milwaukee, at Good City Brewing’s two locations, owner David Dupee plans to “control the number of people and mark off space where people should stand while they’re waiting for the restroom — whatever we can do to make people feel comfortable that guests around them will be appropriately distant. But we don’t expect any return to normalcy until there’s a vaccine. We’ve all been trained in recent weeks to walk across the street when we see other people on the sidewalk. That’s just in our psyche now.”

Outdoor venues might seem to be the easiest to reopen, but whether they are sports stadiums, concert facilities or parks, visitors still eventually need to go — a packed event and beer and soda sales inevitably lead to crowded bathrooms and long lines — so managers of such spaces are focusing on how to provide relief.





The American Hiking Society has recommended that people limit their walks to places in their neighborhoods, in part to avoid having to stop to answer nature’s call. Bathrooms at many parks and beaches are closed, and those that are open struggle with staffing and with maintaining a supply of toilet paper, which remains difficult to find in many places.

Some mayors have even talked about hiring guards to assure that toilet paper doesn’t walk off the premises.

All beach restrooms remain closed in Emerald Isle, N.C., but the Outer Banks town is taking bids from private services to clean bathrooms every 90 minutes and disinfect them every night once they reopen, probably in late May.

Town Manager Matt Zapp said the added measures will cost $250 per cleaning for each of the three public restrooms, as well as the town’s fire, police and EMS stations.



Although beach crowds so far have been “substantially less than normal,” Zapp said, “public demand to return to ‘life as we knew it’ is increasing weekly.”

The closing of many public facilities already has posed a considerable hardship to essential workers such as delivery drivers and police and to homeless people, who say the lack of access to toilets in stores, restaurants and even fire stations has made it difficult to get through the day.

Truckers and food delivery drivers have filled social media with accounts of their fruitless search for open restrooms at their usual stops. Some restaurants now limiting their business to takeout service are barring delivery drivers from their bathrooms, erecting walls of tables and chairs to keep people out.

Some cities have put portable toilets on streets to serve homeless people who previously depended on restrooms in public libraries, community centers and fast-food restaurants.

Seattle opened six hand-washing stations and 14 portable toilets near homeless encampments, and San Francisco is staffing public bathrooms at 49 locations where homeless people congregate.

Even police officers are having trouble finding a place to go during their shifts. Coffee shops are closed, and fire stations formerly hospitable to other first responders are taking a newly cautious approach.

In Manchester, Maine, the fire station restroom was closed to the state and county cops who usually pop in. “No law enforcement,” said the sign on the door.

“We have a small, volunteer fire department, and it would be devastated if we lost a couple of guys who had to quarantine,” said Robert Gasper, who is chairman of the town board of selectmen and a captain in the fire department. “Volunteerism is down across the country, so we can’t afford to take a chance.”

Such uncertainty is likely to remain as people decide when to resume going out, and part of the calculus will be whether they can make it comfortably through a day.

“The new normal is going to be traveling with your own toiletries,” said Sonia Massey, who, with her husband, Bill, developed the Restroom Kit, a packet the size of a deck of cards that includes a toilet seat cover, three feet of toilet paper, and sanitary wipes. They also sell hand sanitizer in misters and gel bottles.

The Masseys, who live in Clinton, Md., have seen sales surge for their five-year-old product — a sign, they say, that people who feel they’ve lost control are eager to take charge of at least life’s most intimate aspects.",1
509,509,626,Where Americans are still staying at home the most,"If youâre still at home, youâre not alone.

After a peak week of sheltering in place in early April, U.S. residents began to inch out of their homes, according to new cellphone data. But even as states begin to âopen up,â more Americans appear to be staying put than sprinting out the door.

Share of time spent at home, for the seven-day period ending on: March 1 April 1 April 7 April 30 Less time at home More 65 % 70 % 75 % 80 % 85 % 90 % 95 % Use two fingers to pan around the map.

Hover to explore county details Note: Counties with fewer than 100 devices in the dataset are shown in gray. Source: Washington Post analysis of SafeGraph data. See full methodology at bottom of article.

According to a Washington Post analysis of data provided by SafeGraph, a company that aggregates cellphone location information, the peak period of our collective, coronavirus-induced lockdown was the seven-day period ending April 7. (There was also a one-day spike on Easter Sunday.) During that time, U.S. residents spent a whopping 93 percent of their time at home, up from the early March averages of roughly 70 percent.

Some governors began relaxing restrictions meant to curb the spread of covid-19 at the end of April, after they were prodded by President Trump and cautioned by public health officials. But as of April 30, people were still at home an average of 89 percent of the time.

The numbers vary greatly by geography. People in some counties appear to barely leave their homes, especially in large metro areas, including hard-hit New York, Detroit and Chicago. People in areas that are less populated tend to leave a bit more, and residents in at least one very rural county in Arizona are approaching the amount of free-roaming time they enjoyed in early March.

Beaches and parks, such as this one in Jacksonville Beach, reopened April 17 â with restrictions â in Duval County, Fla. (Charlotte Kesl for The Washington Post)

To determine when people are home, SafeGraph obtains GPS data through regular pings from smartphones that are running one or more apps from an undisclosed list. (This type of tracking, which requires users to allow location data when they use certain apps, has rattled privacy experts. App users are often not aware that their data is being used by third-party companies.)

[Itâs the middle of the night. Do you know who your iPhone is talking to?]

The company defines âhomeâ as a common location from which a phone pings between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. When the phone pings from elsewhere, SafeGraph assumes the phone is away from home.

Itâs not a perfect measure, but the data, aggregated from an average of 18 million phones per day, reveals broad insights.

Hereâs where people are going

Just because people are leaving their homes more doesnât mean theyâre flouting stay-at-home orders or that theyâve abandoned social distancing. They simply may be enjoying warmer weather outdoors, especially in places such as the Upper Midwest, which had an unseasonable April cold snap.

[Americans widely oppose reopening most businesses, Post-U. Md. poll finds]

Pings from phones within businesses and recreational areas show where people are â and arenât â showing up. Theyâre going to parks and grocery stores, according to Google data, which tracks users via their Google Accounts and compares their locations to a baseline from before stay-at-home orders were in place.

Park visits have trended upward recently.

Workplace visits, however, have not. The percentage of phones (and presumably, their owners) in workplaces dropped steeply in mid-March and has barely risen. More than 30 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks.

SafeGraphâs more granular data shows people are again hitting general merchandise stores such as Walmart and Target at near-March levels. Some are satisfying fast-food cravings at restaurants with counter service.

The data lines up with responses in a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released May 5 in which more than half of people said they were comfortable visiting grocery stores, but 78 percent said they would not be comfortable eating at a sit-down restaurant, and 67 percent said they wouldnât be comfortable shopping in a clothing store. Only 18 percent of respondents were in favor of reopening movie theaters.

State orders donât necessarily dictate behavior

While governors have issued guidelines for reopening their states, businesses and customers have been slow to return in many locales.

One of the earliest states to relax restrictions was Georgia, where a group of southwestern counties are suffering through some of the highest per capita covid-19 death rates in the country. Gov. Brian Kemp (R) allowed spas, hair salons, tattoo parlors, bowling alleys and gyms to reopen on April 24. As of April 30, it did not appear that most Georgians immediately flocked out to get haircuts and hit weight rooms. On average, they were still staying home 86 percent of the time, compared with 92 percent at their early-April peak.

Some states are starting to leave home more than others

Share of time spent at home, for the seven-day period ending on each date

New Jersey South Dakota Select a state: Michigan

In New Jersey, second only to New York in covid-19 deaths, people are spending 96 percent of their time at home, just 1.7 percent less than at the peak. That is both the highest stay-home percentage and the smallest change of any state. Gov. Phil Murphy (D) reopened state parks and golf courses on May 2, but his stay-at-home order is still in effect.

Montanans, by contrast, are going out 10 percent more compared with the peak, the largest change in any state. The state has reported 456 covid-19 cases and 16 deaths as of May 5. Gov. Steve Bullock (D) has allowed retail and churches to reopen and will allow restaurants and schools to open May 7.

Alaskans and South Dakotans are spending the least time at home, 80 percent on average. South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem was one of seven governors to never issue a stay-at-home order. The state has one of the largest coronavirus clusters in the country, at a Smithfield pork-producing plant in Sioux Falls.

Variations on how people move around within states are common and sometimes large, and they often â but not always â follow the pattern of virus outbreaks.

In Florida, people in the populous southern counties of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, where most of the stateâs covid-19 cases have been concentrated and where beaches remain closed, are spending about 4 percent more time away from home than in early April. But people in the adjacent counties of Collier and Monroe, which includes the Florida Keys, were out of their houses 13 percent more as of April 30 than at the peak.

[Where people have died of covid-19 by county]

Areas of Georgia around Atlanta showed almost no decrease, led by Forsyth County, which barely budged from its peak of 97 percent at home. By contrast, people in rural Dooly County in the central part of the state were going out 12 percent more than they had at their stay-home peak, despite having a covid-19 death rate that is 19 times higher than Forsythâs.

In Arizonaâs La Paz County, residents are away from home 25 percent more than they were at the peak â the largest change of any county in the country â and theyâre home just 57 percent of the time, roughly the same rate as in early March. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the difference is just 4 percent off the peak, and as of April 30, people were still home 90 percent of the time.

In general, people in rural areas are away more than people in urban and suburban areas, in large part because stores, services and essential workplaces are much farther away and delivery services are rare or nonexistent. But the trend lines are very similar across all types of places.

The data clearly shows that when Americans were told it was time to stay home, most people did. It also indicates that they are deciding for themselves when to go back out.

About this story

Data for this story was provided by SafeGraph, a company that aggregates location data from tens of millions of devices and compares it with building footprints. The Post analyzed its social distancing metrics data set to estimate the share of time spent at home for each county.

The raw numbers fluctuate from day-to-day and county-to-county, and some counties have far fewer devices than others. To account for these challenges, we adjusted the device counts based on population and performed a multilevel regression using a random effects model on the county, state and national levels. Because people tend to leave their homes far more on weekdays than weekends, we chose to calculate a seven-day rolling average, which results in each âdayâ of data including five week and two weekend days.

This analysis relies on defining a âhomeâ location for every device. SafeGraph does this by finding the usual nighttime location of each device over the course of six weeks. It then buckets that location into a grid of roughly 150-meter-wide boxes across the country. When the device remains in that box, it is considered as being home. Of course this is not perfect, but in aggregate and at scale, SafeGraphâs at-home numbers track with other data sources, including location-data research published by other companies and public polling.

Urbanization figures are based on county designations from the National Center for Health Statisticsâs urban-rural classification scheme.

705,705,861,Twitter to label misinformation about coronavirus amid flood of false claims and conspiracy theories,"Twitter announced Monday that it will start alerting users when a tweet makes disputed or misleading claims about the coronavirus.

The new rule is the latest in a wave of stricter policies that tech companies are rolling out to confront an outbreak of virus-related misinformation on their sites. Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have already put similar systems in place.

The announcement signals that Twitter is taking its role in amplifying misinformation more seriously. But how the platform enforces its new policy will be the real test, with company leaders already tamping down expectations.

Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, acknowledged as much: ""We will not be able to take enforcement action on every tweet with incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19.""

Roth said Monday the platform has historically applied a ""lighter touch"" when enforcing similar policies on misleading tweets but said the company is working to improve the technology around the labels.

An example of how Twitter will alert users to tweets that spread misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter

In February, Twitter said it would add warning labels to doctored or manipulated photos and videos after a recording of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was slowed down to make it appear as though she slurred her words. But even with obviously fake videos, such as one showing Joe Biden lolling his tongue and grinning that was shared by President Donald Trump, the company has since used the label only twice, in part because of technical glitches.

And Twitter has not added any warning labels to politicians' tweets that violate its policies but are deemed in the ""public interest"" under a policy the company announced in June 2019.

Under the newest COVID-19 rules, Twitter will decide which tweets are labeled — only taking down posts if they are harmful.

Politicians' tweets will be subject to the notices, which will be available in roughly 40 languages.

Some of the questionable tweets will run with a label underneath that directs users to a link with additional information about COVID-19. Other tweets might be covered entirely by a warning label alerting users that ""some or all of the content shared in this tweet conflict with guidance from public health experts regarding COVID-19.""

Twitter won't directly fact check or call tweets false on the site, said Nick Pickles, the company's global senior strategist for public policy. The warning labels might send users to curated tweets, public health websites or news articles.

""People don't want us to play the role of deciding for them what's true and what's not true but they do want people to play a much stronger role providing context,"" Pickles said.

The notices, which could start appearing as soon as today, could also apply retroactively to past tweets.

The fine line is similar to one taken by tech rival Facebook, which has said it doesn't want to be an ""arbiter of the truth"" but has arranged for third-party fact checkers to review falsehoods on its site. The Associated Press is part of Facebook's fact-checking program.

One example of a disputed tweet that might be labeled on its site includes claims about the origin of COVID-19, which remains unknown. Conspiracy theories about how the virus started and if it is man-made have swirled around social media for months.

The War on Science

Twitter will continue to take down COVID-19 tweets that pose a threat to the safety of a person or group, along with attempts to incite mass violence or widespread civil unrest. The company has been removing bogus coronavirus cures and claims that social distancing or face masks do not curb the virus' spread for several weeks.",1

How to help seniors who are at risk

Older people are among the most vulnerable to complications from coronavirus. If you know someone who is elderly and at home, consider checking in and asking if you can help shop and deliver groceries on their behalf.

If you have a loved one who lives in a facility, respect rules the facility may have in place, including barring visitors. Deborah Dunn, president of the Gerontological Advanced Practice Nurses Association, says a lockdown is standard protocol for many facilities during flu season and can help shield residents from potential exposure.

How to help ‘flatten the curve’

One of the most important things you can do to help is protect yourself and others. Prevent the spread of the illness by practicing the CDC’s recommended guidance: Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in a public area or after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. Don’t forget to moisturize.

If there has been a coronavirus case in your community, practice social distancing and avoid large gatherings and close contact with others. Yes, social distancing is difficult — and against our very nature — but it can be crucial to “flattening the curve” and slowing transmission of the virus. There are reasons the CDC recommended a nationwide halt to gatherings of 50 people or more and a federal coronavirus task force recommended no gatherings of more than 10. Local governments are canceling large events and ordering restaurants and bars to stop on-site services. These are all efforts to prevent an onslaught of ill people from overwhelming the limited resources of the health-care system.

“The idea is that the sooner you stop that transmission chain, you are actually limiting an exponential growth,” Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Stanford University, told The Post. “That’s really important, because instead of preventing 1,000 cases, you might be preventing 100,000 cases — and a matter of days can make a difference.”

The CDC also recommends wearing face coverings in public, especially in places where social distancing may be difficult, such as in grocery stores, and areas with high rates of community transition. Here’s a guide on how to sew your own fabric mask. Just remember that social distancing still remains an important preventive measure.

How to help at stores

Public health officials have stated this over and over: Please do not buy an N-95 respirator or surgical mask unless you absolutely need it. Widespread panic-buying can deplete the supply of protective equipment needed for health-care workers. Because of mask shortages, groups have created websites with crowdsourced suggestions on how to donate unused protective equipment to hospitals or medical centers.

Similarly, be mindful about how many groceries you buy. If you can afford to, buy enough for at least two to three weeks but don’t take everything off the shelves. If you are older, have chronic health conditions or otherwise at higher risk for complications from the virus, consider having someone else shop for you or getting groceries delivered.

“Because everybody is panicking, there are a lot of people in the grocery stores, so if you belong in that group of people who are 65 or older, or immune compromised, then it is best to get someone else to shop for you, if you can,” said Bettina Fries, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Stony Brook University in New York.

Some grocery stores have offered limited hours for those who are older.

How to help pets and shelters

Local animal shelters and rescue groups across the country are reducing services and canceling fundraisers to protect staff but still need to care for their animals. The Humane Society of the United States suggests helping by adopting or fostering a pet, which will reduce the strain on shelters. The Best Friends Animal Society has a site where you can search for partner organizations near you.

Some shelters also offer pet support services for low-wage families who may not be able to afford caring for their pet. Check with your local shelter to see if there are ways you can donate or help.

The Humane Rescue Alliance suggests checking in with people in your community, especially seniors or those with underlying health issues, and offering to walk their dogs or help with pet food.

1206,1206,1542,'Why didn't they help him?' MMA promoter claims Khabib's father Abdulmanap was sick for 10 DAYS before receiving assistance,"Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, who is in a medically-induced coma with heart problems complicated by COVID-19, suffered without treatment for 10 days in Dagestan before receiving the necessary medical assistance.

The UFC lightweight champion’s father was feeling ill in Dagestan but faced a long wait before receiving medical attention because of a lack of understanding about the deadly virus in his homeland, Russian MMA promotion Fight Nights Global boss Kamil Gadzhiev has claimed.

Promoter Gadzhiev has said he was in touch with Nurmagomedov before the revered trainer was admitted to the Moscow hospital where he is now on a life support machine, and believes he could have caught COVID-19 as a result of one of the mass events that continued in the country while the outbreak spread.

“We talked when he was ill in Dagestan,” Gadzhiev told Sport Express.

“Abdulmanap did not really receive assistance for ten days. Why didn’t they help? Maybe they didn’t understand that it was COVID. Maybe there were no necessary preparations.

“When we corresponded, the risks of the coronavirus were not yet known – even less so in Dagestan. They were not ready to withstand the coronavirus. Why did he get infected? Probably because of mass events, be it a wedding or a funeral.

“Abdulmanap is one of those people who are very much talked about today in the context of the Dagestan coronavirus as a whole. There are people who have not been given proper medical care. There are almost no people left in Dagestan who have not been affected by the coronavirus.

“This is not the fault of doctors. In general, I won’t specifically blame anyone. I’ll just say that people in our republic treated the virus quite negligently. What happened to Abdulmanap is a certain result of [this], unfortunately.”

The 57-year-old was first hospitalized in Dagestan in late April, receiving treatment in regional capital Makhachkala for symptoms reported as being similar to those associated with pneumonia.

When his condition worsened, he was privately flown to a military hospital in Moscow, where he was announced last week as being in a coma following a heart operation.

His middle son, who has a flawless record in 28 UFC contests, provided an update to fans on Instagram on Monday amid reports of his father’s deterioration.

Asking them to pray for him and observe health guidelines aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, the fighter admitted: ""Personally, I've had more than 20 relatives – I don't mean people I know, I mean close relatives – who have been in intensive care.

“Many people I know have died, the parents of people close to me. This virus has affected everyone.

""This virus doesn't ask what your surname or name is, this virus doesn't ask where you work, if you are rich or poor. Everyone has got ill. We can only overcome this together.""",0
298,298,379,"For Cook County Jail, a hot spot of COVID-19, our choices are fast action or mass death","Nicholas Lee, age 42, died of COVID-19 on April 13 while awaiting trial in the Cook County Jail. He was the third person to die of COVID-19 while jailed, and 353 incarcerated people and 261 staff have since then tested positive.

“I feel like I lost the battle for my husband,” Lee’s widow told the Chicago Sun-Times.

Most people in Cook County Jail have not been convicted of any crime, and are being held because they don’t have the money to post bail. But even as the number of people in the jail who are sick with COVID-19 increases, another week has passed without significant action by county officials to reduce the jail population.

Opinion

Social distancing is impossible in the crowded and unsanitary confines of the jail, which is now one of the foremost sites of the pandemic in the nation. Close quarters create a kind of Russian roulette death penalty for people awaiting trial. COVID-19 cases soon could overwhelm the jail’s health systems, creating chaos and making the facility difficult to secure. County leaders must rapidly find ways to responsibly release people and provide housing and safe quarantine outside of the jail.

As researchers, we have been tracking the ways that jails and prisons increase the spread of COVID-19. There are still more than 4,300 people being held in Cook County Jail, and the rate of spread of the virus is about 33 times higher inside the jail than it is in the city of Chicago.

African Americans are jailed disproportionately in Cook County, and this crisis is further heightening racial inequality. While the courts have slowed the number of people entering the jail, releases have not risen to the level required to prevent mass deaths. Each day that passes without a significant reduction in the jail population imperils the health of incarcerated people, jail employees and their families, as well as the health of all those who live in the surrounding communities.

The pandemic is revealing the ways in which Cook County has used the jail to address a myriad of social problems; many people are held in jail because they have an addiction, are homeless, or struggle with mental illness. According to the Chicago Community Bond Fund, at least 260 people languish in jail simply because they are poor and cannot afford to post a low cash bond. Those who pose no threat to public safety should not be held in jail, but Cook County’s social safety net is thin, so jail is often used in place of a homeless shelter or psychiatric hospital.

In mid-March, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx and Public Defender Amy Campanelli worked together to identify a list of hundreds of people who could be released from jail without posing a threat to public safety. While an important first step, this process was not exhaustive, and many more cases should be considered for release.

It is time for Cook County officials, Chief Judge Tim Evans and Criminal Division Chief Judge LeRoy Martin Jr. to get back to the table, identify all people who can be safely released and create a process for expedited hearings and releases. If they don’t, it could soon become impossible to provide medical care for the number of cases in the Cook County Jail, and these cases threaten to overwhelm the county’s medical systems.

Sheriff Tom Dart has taken steps to improve sanitation and distancing practices in the jail, including the moving of people to single cells, but no one can meaningfully control the spread of COVID-19 or prevent mass deaths in a crowded jail. Hand soap and sanitizer are rationed, hundreds of people share bathrooms, and health care is in short supply. Even when assigned to single cells, people sleep within a few feet of one another.

It is not too late to responsibly release people from Cook County Jail, strengthening the county’s efforts to flatten the curve of the spread of the coronavirus. A coalition of civil rights groups has sued Dart in federal court to secure the immediate release of many of those being held in the jail. On April 9, a federal court sent the suit back to a state court, creating further delays.

Cook County leaders should look to San Francisco, where efforts to control COVID-19 in the local jail have been swift and effective. The San Francisco district attorney and public defender worked together to quickly reduce the jail population by 40%. They assessed who was safe for release, including the elderly, some veterans, those being held for misdemeanors, those awaiting placement in a mental health facility, those being detained simply because of an inability to pay bail, and those already scheduled for release.

San Francisco has proved that mass release can be done safely.

Just as Mayor Lori Lightfoot acted quickly to repurpose McCormick Place to treat COVID-19 cases, fast action must be taken to depopulate the jail now, so that detainees and community members alike can effectively practice social distancing.

Lightfoot has led efforts to turn empty downtown hotels into housing for people who have tested positive for COVID-19 but have mild symptoms. Why can’t empty hotel rooms across the city be used to house those who need a safe place to quarantine after release from jail?

Creative housing solutions that offer people a safe two-week quarantine upon release, along with greatly expanded access to testing for COVID-19 for everyone in contact with the jail, could save the lives not only of incarcerated people, but also jail workers and others.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote, “justice too long delayed is justice denied.”

In this case, justice delayed is spiking the curve and putting everyone’s lives in danger.

142,142,198,Democrats put corruption reform on ice: ‘More time will be necessary to complete our work’,"SPRINGFIELD — Corruption busting is the latest casualty of the coronavirus in Illinois.

Illinois House Majority Leader Greg Harris, D-Chicago, and state Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, chairs of the Joint Commission on Ethics and Lobbying Reform, said Tuesday that the pandemic has forced them to miss a deadline in their efforts.

The commission was required to release a report by Tuesday with recommendations on how to end entrenched corruption in Illinois, but as the COVID-19 crisis has temporarily shut down sessions of the General Assembly, it has also stymied the work of the commission.

“We have completed our meetings, heard from stakeholders and are working through the proposals that have been put before us,” the two Chicago Democrats said in a joint statement. “However, due to the ongoing crisis, more time will be necessary to complete our work.”

The commission, established by the Legislature in November, is tasked with proposing ways to reform state government in the wake of scandals that have rocked state, county and municipal government. Harris and Sims said they still hope to pass ethics reform legislation in the spring legislative session, which is scheduled to adjourn May 31. But since lawmakers have not met since March 5 – and Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday extended the state’s stay-at-home order until April 30 — that could become increasingly difficult.

Before the pandemic altered the landscape, Pritzker declared that ending corruption was a priority. In his State of the State speech in January, the governor said the state must “root out the purveyors of greed and corruption — in both parties — whose presence infects the bloodstream of government.”

A wide-ranging federal investigation targeting state lawmakers and other politicians prompted the latest push.

In September, federal officials raided the offices of state Sen. Martin Sandoval. The Southwest Side Democrat pleaded guilty to corruption charges in January.

In October, state Rep. Luis Arroyo was charged with bribery. The former Northwest Side Democratic legislator’s case is still ongoing. Earlier last year, state Sen. Tom Cullerton, D-Villa Park, was indicted in August for allegedly embezzling money from the Teamsters.

While Republican lawmakers wanted to tackle corruption in the fall veto session last November, Democrats opted to form the commission to study the issue first and to release a report on what reforms are needed.",1
350,350,441,Chicago outdoors and coronavirus: Trout season/turkey hunting/cooling lakes/why/FPD of Will County,"When I heard Gov. J.B. Pritzker talking Thursday about the “phased reopening of some of our state parks,” I immediately thought I would be at Mazonia State Fish and Wildlife Area at dawn on May 1, both to fish and to forage for morel mushrooms.

Not so fast, Mazonia was not on the reopening list. The cooling lakes in northeast Illinois were not either.

So now, my plan is hit Kankakee River State Park the morning of Friday, May 1. I am certain I will not be alone in wanting to hit the 10 or so miles of shoreline there along the Kankakee River.

Readers had a bunch of questions related to the limited reopening of Illinois Department of Natural Resources sites and also about whether the easing of some restrictions would mean anything for the forest preserves restrictions.

Below is what I’ve gathered so far on turkey hunting, trout season, access and reasoning for site openings or still being closed, and an update from the Forest Preserve District of Will County.

Click here for the latest from the IDNR on the evolving opening of some sites. While reading the list of activities mentioned, I did not see turkey hunting listed. Early May has the final days of turkey hunting for those holding permits for specific sites.

So I contacted IDNR deputy director Rachel Torbert, who emailed back Friday:

To ensure the safety of all visitors, hunting remains suspended at state parks, fish and wildlife areas and recreational areas. Understanding closure and fee concerns raised by permit holders, IDNR is reviewing all possible solutions, including refunds for all spring 2020 turkey permits issued by the Department. Additional information will be provided via the IDNR website as soon as it is available.

This is where things get intertwined, with no turkey hunting at the IDNR sites that reopen, no longer do morel foragers or birdwatchers need to wait until 1 p.m. to begin wandering the woods and fields. They can begin doing so at dawn on May 1 at those sites reopening.

* * *

While reaching out to Torbert, I also asked for the reasoning on not opening the cooling lakes and she replied:

Protecting the health and safety of our site visitors, staff and first responders is our highest priority. With that in mind, IDNR worked with Governor Pritzker and the Illinois Department of Public Health to develop a list of state parks, fish and wildlife areas, recreational areas and historic sites which considered many factors. Selected sites represent parks, fish and wildlife areas and recreational areas which are distributed throughout the state and are accessible to many, offer a wide variety of recreational opportunities with acreage to allow for social distancing directives, provide necessary restroom and handwashing facilities, and have on-site staff to ensure the safety of visitors and maintenance of the site and site facilities. Safety of park visitors and potential strain on staff, first responders and law enforcement also were considered when reviewing potential sites. IDNR will continue to work closely with the Governor’s Office and the Illinois Department of Public Health as directives change to further assess site closures.

Technically, I understand, but I wish they would reconsider on the cooling lakes.

I understand keeping the high-volume, high-density, sites, such as Starved Rock SP and William W. Powers State Recreational Area and Illinois Beach SP closed, but some of the lesser sites not being reopened have me scratching my head.

* * *

As to trout season at the Forest Preserves of Cook County sites, director of communications Carl Vogel emailed Friday, “We do not currently have plans for a date for the start of trout season.’’

The opening of trout season in the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County is on hold, pending further review, as communications lead Deb Humiston emailed Friday:

I found out that we’re waiting to review the official signed executive order from the governor’s office when it’s available. We’ll then adjust our operations as needed to align with the revise/extended order. We’ll communicate any adjustments — which will start on May 1 — next week.

Stay tuned on the trout season there and a couple other nearby sites.

Here’s the key paragraphs on the easing of some restrictions at the Forest Preserve District of Will County:

The Forest Preserve District of Will County will reopen its preserve access area parking lots and boat launches on Friday, May 1, as a result of Gov. J.B. Pritzker modifying his stay-at-home order, which was instituted March 21 to fight the new coronavirus pandemic in Illinois. However, all visitor centers, dog parks, latrines and water fountains will remain closed through the duration of the stay-at-home mandate’s extension, which now ends May 30. All public programs, rentals and non-district events have been canceled through May 30. Because the Monee Reservoir visitor center/concessions building is closed, there will be no boat rentals until further notice. These closures and cancellations will remain in effect to help stop the spread of the new coronavirus, which could overwhelm healthcare institutions and cause more deaths. Once parking lots reopen May 1, people should not be congregating in the preserves and at trailheads, which could spread COVID-19. It may be necessary to temporarily close sites where social distancing is not being maintained.

That last paragraph is important.

Slate is making its essential coronavirus coverage free for all readers. Subscribe to support our journalism. Start your free trial.

Usually, when you run a vaccine experiment, there’s tons of red tape. There are ethical boards to consult and subjects to recruit. Then you have to convince people with money that your research is important enough to move forward at all. But now, there’s none of that. A vaccine for the coronavirus is at the top of the priority list, and everyone’s moving as fast as they can.

Dr. Kirsten Lyke is the lead investigator on COVID-19 vaccine trials at the University of Maryland’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. She’s worked on vaccines for years—some have panned out, and some haven’t. She knows trials like this one can take a long time, and she also knows that the vaccine she’s testing may not work at all. But she’s optimistic anyway, and hoping to have a vaccine in just a few short months.

On Thursday’s episode of What Next, I asked Lyke how this is even possible, and spoke with her about the accelerated timeline for the COVID-19 vaccine. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Right now, your vaccines are at the very earliest phase of human testing, called Phase 1.

Kirsten Lyke: A straightforward Phase 1 study is usually 40 to 50 subjects: volunteers who agreed to participate. And it may take anywhere from 12 to 18 months from the time we decide to do a study to ramp it up.

How does that compare with what you’re doing now?

We got a call from Pfizer around April 10 right requesting that we consider participation. We had our first Zoom meeting that Wednesday. It was essentially two weeks of round-the-clock work to get the study up and running, and then last week we put out the call to volunteers asking for recruits.

So are you saying that normally a process that could take a year took four weeks?

A month. That’s exactly what I’m saying.

Can you describe the room where you’re giving the vaccinations? Like, do you have a basement bunker?

It looks like your regular doctor’s office, where we have several individual rooms where we can put one volunteer at a time. But these are really unusual times. So everyone who comes to campus here in Maryland has to wear a mask. We meet them at the door and do a prescreening. We ask them if they’ve been exposed to COVID-19 or if they’ve had COVID 19, go through a list of questions to discern if they have any symptoms of COVID-19, and then do their temperature. Only then are they allowed to get a little golden ticket that allows them to enter the vaccine area.

For vaccination, it’s a process. The very first thing we do before is a nasal-pharyngeal swab, just like everyone around the country is getting. So within 45 minutes, we’ve determined whether they’re shedding the virus, and if they’re negative, we can go ahead and randomize and enter them into the system so that we can get them on the docket for vaccination.

It sounds like you feel like you’re on a clock.

We are on a clock. We’re on a very rapid sprint overlaying a marathon because every single week we have to recruit a number of volunteers to fill our docket for next week’s dose escalation. So we’re vaccinating this particular round while simultaneously recruiting for next week’s round, when we’ll go to the next dose.

How many vaccines a week are you giving?

We’re actually testing four different vaccines at three different dose levels. We’re also doing young people up to age 55. Then we’ll move to older people. Every one of those permutations needs 15 people. This is just, at this stage, a safety and immunity study. We’re looking at immune responses and testing the safety of each of these permutations of the vaccine.

The overarching design of the study is to test people from ages 18 to 85 and ultimately those with all sorts of risk factors for COVID-19: diabetes, hypertension, lung disease. But right now, in these very, very early stages, we’re testing just the 18- to 55-year-olds who are healthy. Come June, we’ll move to the older age group. Come July, we’re going to move to people who have other comorbidity conditions. And as we work our way along the ladder, we’ll cover the full panoply of people who are most at risk and need to have a vaccine.

One of the things that is helping for this particular scenario is that everything is shut down. At our center, it’s called severe restriction: We’re not allowed to do other studies or invite volunteers for any of our other ongoing studies. It’s prioritized as COVID-19 studies only.

So this is all you can work on.

For the most part, everything has been stalled. Anyone who has expertise in what we do is declared essential and allowed to be on campus to continue research. Everyone has been freed up of their day-to-day work to have time to concentrate on just doing this trial.

How do you speed things up without cutting corners? Even if you pour people into something, it still takes a toll to move so fast.

Obviously a COVID-19 vaccine has not been in people and has not really been in a lot of preclinical studies, where they go into different animals and officials do exhaustive testing. Mice have been injected and we have very limited data, but most of the data that was given to the FDA to move forward on this was with companion vaccines that had been made with the same platform but weren’t necessarily COVID-19-based vaccines.

So it’s the same method, but it’s not the same virus.

Right. So that may not fly in ordinary situations. But the FDA has agreed that the preponderance of evidence established that this was safe. We have safety data, but to some degree, it might not be the mountains of data that are typically generated before moving forward.

What kind of people are volunteering for this? I know you pay them, so there’s an incentive, but who’s going up and saying, “I want to be on the front lines of testing a pretty unproven vaccine”?

The good thing is that there are a lot of people at home who wanted to do something. Obviously there are people who need some money. But I would say overwhelmingly it’s not people looking for any compensation. Most tell me they’re going to donate their checks. It’s people from the community. It’s people maybe associated with the university but who aren’t in direct patient care.

Are you even really testing for how effective the vaccine is, or is it mostly just safety? I know that in a Phase 1 trial, you may look for a little bit of effectiveness, but you’re mostly just saying, can we do this?

“I don’t think we want to wait the amount of time it takes for society at large to develop immunity.” — Kirsten Lyke

Right now we’re interested predominantly in safety and also whether the immune response that’s mounted is actually specific to the virus and in a petri dish can neutralize the antibodies. We are collecting data so that if people develop COVID-like symptoms, we’ll have them do a self-swab and send it to us so we can collect all of that data. The length of the trial for people participating right now is actually 26 months, even though we hope we’ll have picked a vaccine and it’s gone into production well before that. You know, as early as this autumn, they’re still going to be participating and coming in for blood draws so we can see how long their antibody response lasts.

Like a lot of things when it comes to this coronavirus, with this vaccine, we are going to be learning a lot on the fly. Even if it’s proved safe and goes into production in the next few months, we might not know exactly how effective it is until after it gets released. There’s an element of taking it on faith. So what does effectiveness look like in a vaccine like this? I get the chickenpox vaccine and I don’t get that condition. Do you think we’re going to be able to promise that a vaccine we’re working on so quickly for a condition we’re really just learning the contours of?

There are so many unknowns that it’s impossible to say. I can say that this is what we hope for: that the vaccine we’re developing today is going to work and it’s going to cover people for a reasonable amount of time. And that is where what is reasonable to me may not be reasonable to someone else. Everyone has experience with the flu vaccine—every year we have to make a new crop of vaccines. The total overall efficacy differs year after year, 70 percent, 50 percent.

Sometimes it’s zero percent efficacy.

Sometimes it’s not effective at all. And that would not be acceptable. I mean, we’re hoping for a high level of protective efficacy in a virus that’s not mutating. That’s a lot to ask. We just don’t know how this is going to all play out. All we know is that there are other coronaviruses circulating, like the common cold—which isn’t a deathly illness. Hopefully this will morph into that. But I don’t think we want to wait the amount of time that it takes for society at large to develop immunity.

In you pre-pandemic work, you focused on diseases like dengue, which is caused by a virus, and malaria, which is caused by a parasite. We’ve been looking for a vaccine for those for years, and we still haven’t found anything, really.

That’s absolutely correct. Half a million people die of malaria a year. And there is no sense of urgency anywhere up and down the levels of vaccine development.

I wonder if it kind of makes you humbled looking at this coronavirus, with folks saying we want a vaccine in 18 months. You know how hard the work is.

Malaria is a different beast. It is very, very difficult to develop a vaccine because it’s so complicated. The beauty of viruses is they’re so simple—they can’t even replicate themselves. HIV is an exception because it morphs and changes genetically. It’s constantly evolving, so it’s hard to keep up. But Ebola, for example, is a simple virus. It can’t mutate that quickly because it typically ended up killing people before it had a chance to mutate. So it was relatively easy to make a vaccine, and we’re kind of hoping the same thing with COVID-19, not to minimize the difficulty.

You sound so confident!

Well, I think we’re going to get it. I mean, there are a hundred companies claiming they have a vaccine that they want to bring to fruition. We just happen to have been part of a process that had the financial means and the infrastructure to get it off the ground very quickly. So I hope this one works, but I also hope other vaccines work because by the time we get to autumn and start ramping up production, I don’t think one company is going to be able to develop worldwide mass production immediately.

647,647,787,Need to escape? How about a drive through Melbourne or Mumbai?,"Hop in the car, crank up the radio and just drive — for miles and miles.

What most of us wouldn’t give for an extended change of scenery right about now.

And now you can, in a way. The “Drive and Listen” app, created by a Turkish graduate student, offers a driver’s view cruising through many of the world’s best-known cities — all while listening to a radio station from that city. Some journeys last a few minutes, others up to an hour.

Perhaps you choose to rumble through Rome, on cobblestone roads with palazzi so close together it feels as dark as night even in the middle of the day. The road widens and you’re in scorching sunlight, with the Colosseum looming in the distance. Or maybe you choose London, where, beneath leaden skies, the city’s famous black taxis zip and dart like shiny beetles along narrow streets.

Or let’s say you have a hankering for home — the way it used to be. You can take a drive along the lakefront as sunset approaches. You pull up to a stoplight just north of Monroe on Lake Shore Drive. Couples with baby strollers and joggers crowd the crosswalk in a time before face masks and social distancing.

Erkam Seker, 24, created the app in April while self-isolating in Munich, Germany, where he is working on a master’s degree in biomedical computing.

“I was so bored at home, and I was missing a ride around my city,” said Seker, speaking Monday via Skype about Istanbul, Turkey. “I used to go out with my friends in a car. Watching the roads as we go is one of the most delicious parts of hanging out.”

He plucked some of the driving videos from YouTube, but as his app gained popularity — he says it’s now received about 3 million views — people sent him videos directly. The app now offers excursions to places as far flung as Melbourne, Australia, and Yekaterinburg, in west-central Russia, where the driver navigates snowy boulevards as street cars, some of which look as though they were built in the Soviet era, rumble alongside the automobiles.

Seker said he typically doesn’t watch the videos from start to finish before posting them. He checks to make sure the video quality is acceptable and that the drivers have chosen interesting streets. Although on one occasion — in Yekaterinburg — the driver navigates, for a time, in an underground parking garage. Fortunately, there’s a fast-forward feature with the app.

And it’s not a total escape. From time to time, a public service announcement cuts in to remind listeners to wear masks and practice good social distancing.",1
56,56,94,Medical weed can now be sold outside pot shops — while some stores halt recreational sales — as coronavirus fears hit cannabis industry,"Officials announced Tuesday that cannabis retailers can sell medical pot outside dispensaries until the end of the month to protect patients who may be susceptible to the coronavirus.

Dispensaries are permitted to sell medical cannabis products on their property, as well as on adjacent sidewalks or curbs until March 30, according to new guidance from the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation.

“Our top priority is to minimize the risk of and protect as many people as possible from exposure to COVID-19,” said Toi Hutchinson, Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s senior adviser for cannabis control. “These steps prioritize that critical objective, while also ensuring medical patients have access to the medicine they need.”

Patients in the state’s medical cannabis and opioid alternative programs and chosen caregivers will be able to purchase pot under the new guidance, while recreational customers will have to continue shopping inside.

Shops are also being advised to keep customers six feet apart by moving lines outside, closing cash registers and minimizing the time workers stand near customers. Employees should wear gloves while handling cash, frequently wash their hands and avoid asking patients to physically hand over their medical cards to be scanned, the IDFPR said.

Though pot deliveries are prohibited under state law, many stores have started encouraging customers to make orders online to expedite the shopping experience. Dispensaries that largely accept cash only will also be able to process transactions outside, allowing for curbside pick-ups.

Meanwhile, at least eight Illinois dispensaries have shut down adult-use sales to prioritize medical pot patients and others have limited the hours recreational users can shop. Among them are The Herbal Care Center on the Near West Side, MOCA Modern Cannabis in Logan Square and Dispensary 33 in Uptown.

”We understand that not everyone with a medical need has a medical card, but until further notice we can only serve medical patients,” Dispensary 33 posted on Twitter Monday.

Cresco Labs, the largest Illinois pot firm, will continue selling recreational cannabis at its four dual-use stores across the state, including at its store in Lake View.

“We feel that we need to continue to provide access for everyone that relies on cannabis for their daily well being, whether they’re a card carrying patient or not,” said Cresco spokesman Jason Erkes. “But we’ll obviously follow whatever state guidelines and mandates are put in place.”",1
267,267,344,"What Students Are Saying About Acts of Kindness, Internet Habits and Where They’d Like to Be Stranded","
For this week’s roundup of student comments on our writing prompts, we asked teenagers to tell us about acts of kindness they have observed since the onset of the coronavirus. We also wanted to know how their internet habits have changed and where they would like to be stranded during the pandemic.
We’d like to give a warm welcome to the new students who joined the conversation this week from: Aurora, Ill.; Bethesda, Md.; Cambria School of Excellence; Camdenton, Mo.; Carbondale, Colo.; Desplaine, Ill.; El Paso, Tex.; Ella T. Grasso Southeastern Technical High School, Conn.; Eugene, Ore.; Gladeville Middle School; Healy, Alaska; Hopkinton, N.H.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Lake of the Ozarks, Mo.; Larchmont, N.Y.; Lovettsville, Va.; Marblehead, Mass.; Marlborough, Mass.; Middleton, Mass.; Springfield, Ore.; Stratford, Conn.; Utah and Valencia High School.
Please note: Student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear as they were originally submitted.
_________What Acts of Kindness Have You Heard About or Participated In During Coronavirus?
While the current crisis has brought lots of stress, grief and uncertainty into our lives, it has also led to acts of kindness, generosity and solidarity.
We asked students what acts of selflessness they have witnessed. They told us about the ways, big and small, they and other have been making an impact in their communities.
Making masksOne act of kindness that I’ve been participating in is making masks with my mom and selling them to people for very low prices. We go to stores and buy certain fabrics and materials either with designs or no designs and make them into beautiful masks. Recently we’ve been selling them to workers and they have said some very nice comments towards the masks and our dedication to helping people. Another thing I do is deliver the masks to people around our neighborhood that can’t go outside so I just suit up put on my mask and gloves and head out and I can say that this has brought much joy to me especially when I know that I’m using my time well and not sitting around playing video games all day.— jose Martinez, Desplaine Illinois
I’ve heard of many people sewing masks out of their materials and decontaminating them. They then can safely distribute them to people in their community to use less surgical masks that are in high demand and needed in hospitals. I think this is useful because it can also encourage people who may be sick to wear masks while they are out while simultaneously saving resources that are needed by health care workers. It’s something people can do in the safety of their homes to help their community.— Kathleen S., J.R. Masterman
Cooking for othersMy mom works for the hospital and I have been volunteering to help with “Meals for Heroes” that is sponsored by the Greater Wilmington Business Journal and New Hanover Regional Medical Center. Different businesses are providing 100 meals per day, to the front line workers at the hospital. I have been helping hand out the meals to the hospital staff as they drive down “Gratitude Lane.”— Daniel Guy, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC
Throughout the coronavirus outbreak, my mom and I have cooked numerous dishes for older people we know. We made lasagna, cake, soup, various treats, vegetable plates, and more. We do so to promote them to quarantine and eliminate any reason for them to leave the house. My mom also buys groceries for her parents and older friends. I try to lighten up my grandparents by calling them. I do other types of community service within my girl scout troop, including fundraisers, making blankets and for animals in shelters, and caroling to elders. On our own, my mom and I hand out water and granola bars to homeless people. The quote “it’s better to give than to receive” does have some truth. If you are in a place to give, then give, so someone in need gets help.— Isadora Monteith, J.R. Masterman
Donation effortsAs the world is going through a pandemic, our school decided to send a care package to three different hospitals in South Korea (that is where I live). We donated snacks, drinks, shampoo, soap and handmade cards. I am also growing my hair so I can donate it to make wigs for children with cancer. During easter our family and some other people brought masks and gave it to others in need.— Allison Go, South Korea
Recently, my sister and I realized that our bookcases were full of books we had not read in years, either because we had already read them, or because they were children’s books. With all the free time we had over the weekend, we decided to sort through our books and decide which ones to donate. We each ended up with huge piles of books, and we organized them into categories. At this point, we could have donated all of the books to some organization. However, we wanted to know exactly where our books were going so we could feel the effect of the deed more. My mom posted pictures of all of our books on the “Moms of New Rochelle” Facebook group with the caption “free books.” She instantly began receiving messages from mothers who said their children were running out of books to read since the libraries are now closed. We messaged back and forth with some of the mothers, suggesting books for their children based on their ages and interests. Every mother expressed gratitude; one even asked how she could repay us, telling us she could send us gloves if we wanted. We refused, partly because we did not need gloves, but also partly because the good feeling we got from doing the deed was sufficient pay.— Daviel Schulman, New Rochelle, NY
VolunteeringDuring the coronavirus epidemic my church has supported homeless people by giving them food and items like a mask, hand sanitizer, and blankets to stay safe. Homeless people right now need as much help as possible to stay healthy during the pandemic. They don’t have the money or the resources to stay afloat. I believe with everything that my church does can help them.— Izel, J.R. Masterman
Since I can remember, my family’s value system has been based on volunteering and helping others. I don’t remember a season where my temple congregation was running an annual charity drive that my family did not help execute. Throughout my life I have renovated parks, run food donation trips, and organized clothing drives. Not only were these roles expected of me, it felt natural to spend my time giving to others. During the high holidays, I had the opportunity to donate over 500 bags of food to our local food kitchen with my youth group. Giving to others helped me realize that life was much bigger than what was right in front of me. The action of providing help, health and happiness to others filled me with a joy I had never experienced. I am lucky enough to be able to give onto others and it is one of the most valuable gifts one can achieve. — Hayden Roberge, New Rochelle, NY
One of my friends has an upcoming Bar Mitzvah. Many kids do a mitzvah protect for their Bar/Bat Mitzvah. A mitzvah project is a project that helps other people. My friend chose to do his at the Jewish Relief Agency (JRA). At the JRA, once a month, people come to a warehouse and help pack boxes with food. Then people deliver the boxes to people who need the food. I often went to help him pack and deliver boxes with him. I think that the act was incredibly beneficial to me because It helped me realize how many people need help in this world. This experience was also really fun. That made me realize that helping others can be as exciting for you as it is for the person you are helping sometimes— Jonah Smith Posner, J.R. Masterman
Small, but meaningful, gestures I haven’t really been able to do too many things for people other than texting and calling people to let them know I’ve been thinking of them. I have been trying to make an effort to talk to people I don’t normally talk with, just offering a fun conversation to distract from the world. An act I have experienced is people I don’t normally talk to reaching out to talk to me, and that meant a lot, and that is what inspired me to start doing the same.— Jamie, Healy, AK
Sometime last week, my friends and their parents got together and invited our neighborhood to put up lights on each of their houses. My family put up a sign in one of our windows that reads “HOPE” in colorful light, and I’ve seen other houses use this invitation very creatively. Throughout this pandemic, there can still be ways to illuminate the world with our goodness, even if it’s from a distance.— Kaycia B., NUAMES High School, Layton UT
I heard about people thanking garbage collectors for their work during such difficult time. A few words can go a long way, and many of these kind verbal acts have had positive impacts on these people. Even if you don’t have money to donate, it’s completely free to thank someone for the difficult work they’re doing in such times. Those people are putting their lives at risk for us, so it’s the least we can do.— Saharsh Satheesh, Collierville High School, Tennessee
In a dire time like this, keeping in touch and helping others really matters. This pandemic really pushes us to aid the ones we love to keep them safe, and talk to the people we truly care about to not loose communication in this month of isolation. My family has been sending food and puzzles to my grandparents to keep them busy and so they don’t have to go to the store as it can be dangerous for them especially. Acts of kindness towards others are very meaningful now more than ever.— Autumn Klein, Glenbard West, Glen Ellyn, IL
I’ve been hearing from my grandma that people in her community are dropping groceries at her door so she doesn’t have to go to the supermarket. These acts of kindness, which I hear are happening throughout her town, give me hope that communities will come together in these trying times. I am grateful to anyone helping the elderly right now, as they are especially vulnerable to the virus, and really cannot afford to leave their homes even for groceries.— Madeline Fox, Pennington NJ
_________How Has the Coronavirus Changed How You Use the Internet?
As the coronavirus rages, homebound students are spending increasingly more time online and so we asked students about how their internet habits have changed.
Reflecting on their hyper-digital lives, many students were dismayed by the quantity and quality of their screen time and its impact on their physical, mental and emotional health. Some, however, have seized the opportunity to forge new intellectual, civic and social connections, trying to thrive amid an ongoing crisis.
Spending much more time on the internetThe internet has turned from something that I used for entertainment and to help complete schoolwork into what my life revolves around. If I have to do school work, it’s through the internet. If I want to stay in touch with my friends, it’s through the internet. If I want to access anything outside of my home, it’s through the internet. Consequently, the time I’m spending on the internet has grown significantly since the start of quarantine. This has been frustrating because of the lack of face-to-face interaction with anyone aside from my family and exercising becoming more difficult, but it has also opened up new methods in which I can connect with my friends. Because my best friend and I can no longer see one another in person, we’ve begun playing more video games together and have been bonding that way. One of our other friends had their birthday during quarantine and we had a Zoom call to celebrate which we would have never done before. — Sam McNamara, John T. Hoggard High (Wilmington, NC)
Since my school closed originally on March 13th for two weeks, now the rest of the school year, I have been using my phone a lot more than I would in normal circumstances. I used to use my phone 2-3 hours a day but know, my daily average is around 10-12 hours, even up to 15 hours a day. I have been trying to cut down on my daily screen time but it is really hard because I have nothing else to fill my days except for it. Some of my friends are still saying they have been able to keep there screen time down to 5 hours a day and I am like how is that possible? Hopefully, I’ll be able to lower my screen time once online school starts up.—Ryan Altschuler, J.R Masterman School
Binge watchingMy screentime has grown to 8 hours per day which is 6 hours more than it used to before school closed. I am using the Internet more than I ever have. I spend most of that time on Netflix where I have been binging TV shows like Money Heist, Ozark, and Tiger King. I would usually watch the Sixers game every time they play but now there are only live streams NBA stars playing H.O.R.S.E. — Leonard Vekker, J.R. Masterman PA
The Coronavirus has greatly impacted how much time I spend on the internet. My computer is my main source for schoolwork and entertainment. On my computer, I complete all my assignments and watch movies. My most time engaging app is Netflix. I have started binge watching all my favorite shows during all this free time. I read in an article that due to everyone staying home, Netflix’s memberships have doubled. One con towards all this screen time is that it causes many headaches. I spend every day staring at my screen that my head starts to hurt. This is where I take some time to go outside and enjoy the nice weather.— Yahaira H, Cass High School, Georgia
Going to school onlineThe coronavirus has definitely changed the way I use the internet. It has effected me the most in school. I spend about 2-4 hours a day doing online work or video conferences. In some ways online school is better. For example my math teacher post videos of her doing the lesson. Now I am able to go at my own pace, I can pause if I need or re watch something I didn’t understand.
On the other hand I feel overwhelmed with the amount of work I’ve been assigned. It is far more stressful than doing the work at school. It is also difficult because there is lack in communication. I don’t always understand what I’m supposed to do for some assignments. I’ve also had problems with online conferences. I’ve had teachers that accidentally say the wrong time to meet, or not being able to reach some students.— Tiana, Utah
With the recent spread of the pandemic, I find that online school has impacted me the most. Not only I can’t see my friends from school, online school is also way more stressful that normal school. It can be hard to do school when there are so many distractions like YouTube and looking on social media. Or even not feeling motivated to do online school. But the worst part it just trying to find and do the assignments and getting good grades.— Morgan, Eugene OR
I realized that my habits have changed. I use my phone as soon as I wake up to check Google Classroom notifications, not Instagram. The whole situation is ironic because in school, I had the temptation to scroll through Instagram, yet when home, I find myself motivated to achieve the satisfaction of finishing assignments and clicking that submit button. The time I used to spend checking snapchat stories is now time I use to listen to podcasts on Spotify. I find myself naturally distancing from the one object I was addicted to three months ago.— Akshara Koottala, New Rochelle High School, NY
Trying something newBefore coronavirus, I had begun to start relying on my phone less often than usual. My screen time went from five to three hours, and I finally realized that I did not need my phone as much as I thought I did. However, once we were out of school and sports were cancelled, I was on my phone for up to eight or nine hours a day, which is crazy! …
On the bright side, I have started using Twitter more (for news and entertainment purposes), and I am striving to become stronger in financial literacy and the stock market, since it is such a crazy time right now on Wall Street. One of my father’s friends began day trading to pass the time, so it is interesting to hear from him about how his stocks and his money are standing, even with the market as bad as it is.— Carter Osborn, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC
The CoronaVirus has hardly affected my internet usage at all. My screen time has barely gone up at all. I used to average around 15-16 hours on my phone each day, and now I average just about 16 hours. However now I do diversify what I do on my electronics. To pass the time I have been using my electronics to do things like mastering a skill and trying new games— Nathanael Kassahun, J.R. Masterman, Philadelphia, PA
Building relationshipsI find that I get anxious when I spend more time of social media platforms. This being said, now that many of my relationships are based off of screen interaction, I have had to remind myself to spend more time on the phone with friends as opposed to messaging them. Calling someone or FaceTiming them leaves me happier and less anxious then when I type our conversations. I’ve started to call a person per day while social distancing … and it has really helped improve my mental health. I highly recommend!— Madeline Fox, Pennington NJ
My friends and I also try to talk and video chat more often, also allowing me to have a form of social interaction through the internet. I find myself video chatting with family members more consistently rather than talking to them on the phone every few weeks. This allows me to see them virtually, and even though they live thousands of miles away, this allows me to feel closer to them.
While the coronavirus has provided a grand number of changes, the internet has allowed me to keep some consistency and routines in these tough times. Without the online access that we have, I cannot imagine how the world would be able to handle the pandemic since so much of our lives revolve around being connected online.— Nora Shefferman, New Rochelle High School, NY
MourningMy experience has been 50/50 because 2 of my family members died due to the virus and my brother and law had survived the virus and spent two weeks in the hospital. The graph does match my experience because my family is sad of our family members that died and they were important to our lives. There are many videos of nurses crying and how the death rates have grown in New York in the past 2 months and nurses quitting there job to support there families— Arturo Salas, Queens
_________Where Would You Like to Be Stranded?
A couple from South Africa found themselves stranded on their honeymoon in the Maldives after their country closed its borders to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Inspired by their story, we asked students were they would like to be during the pandemic in our Picture Prompt, “Stuck in Paradise.” From beaches to their homes to Target, here’s what they had to say:A tropical getawayIf I was stranded, I would want to be on a beach that has all of the supplies I need to survive. Such as fruits, wood, and things to build a fire. I would probably take one or two of my friends just to try the experiment. I would also bring snorkel stuff and maybe try to borrow a surfboard so I can have fun. I might also bring my dog. I don’t want to have to worry about COVID-19. I would want to get away so that I can get rid of all the anxiety and stress. I might also bring my dog.— Hen, Des Moines, Iowa
If I could be stuck somewhere in the world during this pandemic it would definitely be the Bahamas. The Bahamas is such a beautiful place to spend time and the water is so clear. I would be spending most of my time at the beach or a nice beach house. I would certainly miss my family but if I had the choice, they would be there with me. The Bahamas would definitely take my mind off of the horrible things happening recently with the virus. I could just stay there and relax without having to think about anything.— Kaitlyn Frances, New York
With loved onesMy sister was studying abroad in Paris this year. When Trump closed all travel from Europe, my family was freaking out. They weren’t sure if that meant my sister wouldn’t be able to fly home. That night, my mom waited on hold with Air France for 3 hours in order to get my sister on the soonest flight home to Chicago. Although I was excited that my sister was coming home, at first I was confused why everyone was freaking out so much. I personally would much rather be trapped in Paris, than in the snow here in Chicago. After careful consideration, I realized why it was so important for her to come home. The most essential thing right now is that families stick together. If my sister was still in Paris, my parents would never stop stressing out.
So in the end, I would like to be quarantined with my loved ones. (If I really had a choice, I wouldn’t mind doing my e learning by the pool) But for now, I wouldn’t care where I was, as long as my family was all together.— Ellie Short, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL
I don’t know if stranded would be the right vernacular but if I could be quarantined in any place during this pandemic I would want to go to Korea. I am Korean by my parents and while my immediate family is here in Southern California, my entire extended family is in Korea. Having been to my home country multiple times in the past I know how amazing and different the life there is. But especially during my only-child life-at-home experience, I realized that I want nothing more than to be with my family and my people. — Brenda Kim, Valencia High School
If I were to be quarantined anywhere, I would probably choose Cuba. I have lots of family there who I never get to see, and staying with them for an extended period of time is a luxury for me and my family. Not only would I get to spend time with the people I love, I would get to enjoy the weather and explore the island with my cousins and brother.— Lucia T, Brooklyn, NY
I would want to be stuck in the band room of my school, that is where I have had the best memories, and would be around my favorite people, its truly my home away from home and would do anything to be there right now.— Abigail, Pennsylvania
Somewhere funIf I had to be quarantined anywhere it would definitely be a mountain house in the Lake Tahoe area. I would want to be quarantined here because while the main ski resorts are close you can never really close the backcountry. And while It would definitely be a challenge I think it would be a ton of fun.— Isaac, Brooklyn Ny
I would want to be stranded in Alabama where I could be playing with baby fainting goats, relaxing, being in the heat, eating barbecue, drinking sweet tea and working in the gardens. I would be riding a tractor and swimming.— Kate Schwartzman, NYC
I would honestly like to be stranded in Traverse City, Michigan during the summertime. The weather is absolutely amazing in that time of the year. I’d rather experience the fascination of the sunset in the Grand Traverse Bay rather than being stuck at home during this pandemic constantly getting bored. I’ve had a few days where I have rode my bike through my neighborhood, but it isn’t as enjoyable as walking through the downtown area of Traverse City and visiting the shops in the area. The breeze I tend to get in my area doesn’t feel as good as the breeze you get on Pangea’s Pizza’s rooftop seating while having a basket of cajun jerk french fries.— Gavin Meek, Detroit, MI
A strategic locationIf I could be stuck anywhere during this quarantine, it would be in Target. It is literally the smartest option and one of the best places on Earth. If your bored they have televisions, phones, and video games. If your hungry they have a food section and even a (Starbucks depending on your location). You also do not have to worry about weather or animals because it is indoors … It is also the perfect opportunity to do things almost everyone secretly wishes they could do in Target like create a mountain of pillows or ride the carts up and down the aisle.— Ashira, Cambria Heights
I would be stuck in my video game room. It‘s not necessarily paradise but it is my favorite pass time. I would never get bored because the vide games are with me. Honestly that sounds awesome to me.— Atticus, Earth
If I were stranded somewhere during this pandemic, I would like to be stranded on Pitcairn Island, South Pacific. I would want to be stuck there because the Island is very remote with only 50 people currently living there. The chances of me getting the virus is less likely in a more remote location rather that a place that is densely populated. Also, because it is not very populated, there will be more resources to go around like food and water. And because it is surrounded by water, there should be plenty of fish to eat and fish is a good source of vitamins and minerals. My last and final reason why I chose this place is because the views are amazing and I would probably spend my days swimming in the clear water and hiking in the forest.— Franklin, Philadelphia
I know this is weird, but I’d want to be stuck in Singapore Changi Airport. That place is huge, filled with entertainment, and looks absolutely stunning! I would just spend my days walking around and exploring that airport, I’ve heard they have entire malls, and even rooms for people to stay in. Being stuck in one place sucks, but at least I’m in an airport, when ever the pandemic ends, I’d be the one of the first to get on a flight and go home.— Khang T, Saint Louis
No place like homeDuring a pandemic, there’s no place I’d rather be than at home. A tropical island or some exotic place would seem nice at first, but then I’d start to feel lonely, and the fear of getting sick would outweigh any feelings of excitement for being on vacation. By being stuck at home, I’m with my family and near my friends. At home, the feeling of familiarity outweighs any fear of getting sick.— NK, King of Prussia
If I were to be stranded somewhere during a pandemic, I would want to be home. Yes, of course being on a tropical island with the sun shining down on you all day would be amazing. But during such a strange time, I’d want to be somewhere a safe and with people I trust. I would spend my time relaxing and learning new things, trying to find new hobbies. Being stuck somewhere not able to go home would be a challenge but that means you are in a whole new environment so I’d embrace it and see if there is something there I can do.— Brandon, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL
If I was stuck somewhere I would want it to be my home because my home is were my family is and since I am just a kid, I can’t Survive anywhere else. Plus, I love my family, they give me food and shelter, they care for me. So if there is anywhere I would want to get stuck at. It would be my home.— Konrad Filbeck, Bethesda Maryland",1
325,325,413,"Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson team with Tom Brady and Peyton Manning for golf event","Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson are ready for a made-for-TV rematch at a time when fans are craving live action.

And this time, they’ll have company.

Turner Sports says quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning will join them for a two-on-two match sometime in May. Missing from the announcement were such details as when and where the match would be played, except that tournament organizers would work with government and health officials to meet safety and health standards.

Turner said all donations and fundraising from “The Match: Champions for Charity” would benefit relief efforts for the COVID-19 pandemic.

The event will be televised on TNT, with social and digital content leading up and during the event available through Bleacher Report and House of Highlights.

“It’s on now,” Mickelson tweeted Wednesday afternoon responding to Bleacher Report.

He added that he would be paired with Brady, saying:

“After feeling the sting of defeat the first time around, Looks like @TigerWoods is bringing a ringer to The Match (#PeytonManning). I’m bringing a GOAT. @TomBrady — Ready to hit bombs?”

Opinion contributors

Americans want our country to open up safely.

We have been at this for a number of difficult weeks since the global coronavirus pandemic began, and it has taken a toll.

It has been a time of unprecedented challenge. To our health. To our jobs. To our social connections. To our health care communities.

We have sacrificed with great unity to #StayHome in order to reduce the infection rate and save lives.

We want a sense of normalcy back — to go to work, to go to restaurants, to see sports again, to send our kids to school, to hug our families — but not at the expense of the lives of our friends, families and neighbors.

We want a good economy and public safety, but we are afraid if we open too quickly, or don’t have plans to adjust if spread recurs, we will have neither.

We don’t believe we need to wait until everything is completely perfect or there is zero risk before we open again. The reality is that many states are already taking the first steps toward opening, and this must happen in the safest way possible.

Americans should still #StayHome whenever possible and continue social distancing. Now we need to get on a path to #OpenSafely that gets it right.

Still growing, contagious and lethal

COVID-19 is still spreading, but at a steadier rate. While it is shrinking in places like New York, it is still growing rapidly in some areas where there had been fewer cases. The virus is still equally contagious. The virus is still lethal to many. The virus still spreads through unsuspecting asymptomatic people. Some places are especially hard hit: nursing homes, meatpacking plants, prisons, detention centers, public housing, and the communities around them as people move in and out. People are still dying at an alarming rate, and that will continue unless we follow the path like the one outlined by Dr. Deborah Birx at the White House: a steady, gated reopening that avoids accelerated growth in cases, hospitalizations and deaths.

Tens of millions of Americans are now out of work. Many businesses have closed; others are in danger. Americans are facing hunger and the inability to pay their rent or mortgage at levels not seen here since the Great Depression. Congress and the administration have passed laws to support Americans through this, but support isn’t the same thing as a job. And the support still leaves voids that need to be filled.

Yet opening the country before we have the conditions like those outlined in the White House plan can put Americans at risk unless we take further steps. It won’t help the economy if we end up having to pull back hard or close again because the virus starts spreading toward the point where it threatens our health care systems and further disrupts our health. The things that will bring us back — consumer spending, business hiring, signing leases, travel and capital investment — won’t happen unless Americans feel confident they can do these things without a substantial risk of harm to themselves or their loved ones from getting and spreading COVID-19.

We are asking decision-makers at all levels to #OpenSafely — to move along the path of opening up our communities again as deliberately as necessary and as quickly as can be safely accomplished.

Opening up safely means:

►Following the plan laid out by Dr. Birx to begin opening communities up with two weeks of declining case counts and the other gating criteria met — or explaining how there is an alternative plan for containment if that condition is not met.

►Creating adequate diagnostic testing availability so that people who need a test can get one — particularly people with symptoms, and those without symptoms in high-risk settings like nursing homes, prisons and meatpacking plants.

►Implementing improved safety standards and protocols to avoid outbreaks and slow spreading in potential hot spots.

►Having adequate public health infrastructure to contact trace and offer voluntary isolation to contain the virus when it is detected — not necessarily to trace all cases successfully, but enough to minimize potential outbreak clusters and keep getting better over time.

►Protecting vulnerable and at-risk populations and hard-hit communities, and not putting essential workers at needless risk.

►Obtaining sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect our first responders and health care workforce, including by expanding access to testing in the community

Pause if care capacity is threatened

As the reopening process begins and moves forward, states should be carefully monitoring hospitalization trends and their hospital capacity. If the rise in cases is on track to threaten hospitals’ capacity to care for COVID-19 or other acutely ill patients in the state, states should immediately take steps to slow or pause reopening efforts. The lag between infection and serious complications is typically eight days or more, so there is little time to wait if such trends emerge.

Additional important areas to make progress on that will reduce risk of transmission and support continued opening up:

►Widespread use of high-quality masks.

►Surge capacity in the health care system with sufficient PPE to protect health care workers.

►Evidence-based mitigation measures and screenings in offices and public spaces, using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or comparable ones.

►Controls at major air and rail entry points.

►Continuous monitoring at the state and county level for indications of potential emerging outbreaks, including symptom-checking apps, digital thermometers and other syndromic surveillance tools as they become available.

►Test, trace and isolate most active cases and their closest contacts, using vacant hotel space where necessary.

►Coordinated response with neighboring states.

►Widespread use of telemedicine to improve health care access and reduce the use of PPE.

►Readiness to respond quickly to new community spread.

Safest to carefully open up

Areas that can most safely open up (with appropriate distancing and risk mitigation steps) if states have met the Dr. Birx gating criteria but have not yet initiated the reopening process are:

►Doctor offices, clinics and surgery centers with sufficient community PPE.

►Workplaces like retail and manufacturing.

►Parks and other outdoor recreation, lakes, gardens and bike trails.

►Shopping areas and coffee shops where people don’t congregate in large numbers or for extended periods.

►Outdoor weddings and funerals with small groups that physically distance and wear masks when close together.

Additional areas that we hope can open up successfully under significantly modified conditions, but that will benefit from further technical assessment on how processes should be modified that would allow them to operate with lower risks:

►Day care centers

►Summer camps and youth sports

►Restaurants

►Schools

►Movie theaters and small entertainment venues

►Sporting events with very limited or no crowds

►TV and film production

►Colleges and universities

►Bars

Areas that should remain closed until risks can be significantly reduced:

►Large-scale events like concerts, sports with high attendance

►Large conventions and other activities involving significant travel and congregation

We believe these lists can be refined and adjusted locally based on conditions, proximity to hot spots, density and other factors.

We are asking public officials and decision-makers to #OpenSafely by quickly getting the conditions in place so we can move forward. We are encouraged that other countries, including Germany, Italy and New Zealand, as well as parts of the United States, are implementing strategies to begin to open safely and closely monitor a step-by-step opening. We believe a safe step-by-step opening can happen across the United States.

We believe Americans want to remain united in the fight against COVID-19, as we were in the initial response after 9/11. We can overcome this epidemic with smart policies and committed actions.

737,737,897,Everything you need to know about a second round of coronavirus stimulus checks,"With almost 37 million Americans out of work due to coronavirus shutdowns, Democratic lawmakers are proposing a second round of stimulus checks to provide some financial relief, potentially worth more than the first round. Most eligible Americans have by now received their check, called economic impact payments, though some are still being mailed to those who did not provide direct deposit information to the IRS. The checks have provided something of a cushion to the tens of millions of people who are out of work or have had their hours reduced, though many critics and lawmakers said they did not go far enough. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said a second round of direct payments is ""necessary"" for the survival of many Americans, and that they would help stimulate the economy. But those checks are not likely to hit bank accounts soon, if at all. Here's what you need to know.

Where does the legislation stand?

House Democrats introduced the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or HEROES Act, a new piece of coronavirus legislation, that, among other relief measures, includes a second round of stimulus payments of up to $1,200 per person. The bill was passed in the House on Friday, but it is unlikely to make it through the Republican-controlled Senate, at least in its current form, NBC News reports. ""What Nancy Pelosi is proposing will never pass the Senate,"" Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said Tuesday.

How much would the checks be worth?

Under the legislation, individuals would receive another payment of up to $1,200 (or $2,400 for married couples), and $1,200 per dependent (up to three). The income eligibility thresholds would be the same as the first round of checks: Individuals earning up to $75,000 and couples earning up to $150,000 would receive $1,200. After that, the checks would completely phase out at $99,000 for individuals and $198,000 for couples.

What about dependents?

Unlike the first round of checks, all dependents would be eligible for the additional credit, not just those under 17. And that credit is worth much more: $1,200, compared to $500 for the first round. Each household could receive a maximum of three dependent credits. The first round of stimulus checks excluded adult dependents, including many in college.

What else is different?

This legislation also does not require recipients have a Social Security number to be eligible, which means those who file taxes with a taxpayer identification number (TIN) could receive a check this time around. Those without an SSN were excluded from the first round of checks.

What else is in the bill?",1
119,119,170,How recreational weed went from illegal to essential in 3 months,"Throngs of high-minded shoppers started flooding pot dispensaries when sales of recreational weed kicked off in Illinois at the start of the year.

Less than three months later, that type of mass clamoring is strictly forbidden as social distancing measures have been put in place to quell the spread of the novel coronavirus. In the uncertain age of COVID-19, when news and information travels almost as fast as the virus itself, Jan. 1 likely seems like a lifetime ago to many cannabis users.

Unlike thousands of businesses, however, pot stores have been able to keep their doors open under Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s statewide stay-at-home order, which labeled all dispensaries and cultivation centers “essential businesses.” The decision to allow the high times to keep rolling amid the rising public health crisis is an acknowledgment that, for many Illinoisans, buying weed is as vital as doing laundry or grocery shopping.

“People all over the nation are running to cannabis right now,” said Margo Vesely, executive of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the country’s oldest weed advocacy group.

“People are selling out just like we are selling out of necessities, just like toilet paper and bread. A lot of people are dependent on it,” added Vesely, who noted that alcohol sales are also still allowed.

Similar to ibuprofen

As similar stay-at-home directives are being issued in states across the country, many have deemed marijuana businesses essential. In Massachusetts, medical sales are allowed to continue but recreational operations were forced to shut down on Monday — a move pot advocates said was short-sighted.

Vesely argued that it’s important for people who use the drug for health and wellness purposes to continue to have access to recreational pot. That’s because many of them simply can’t afford to pay for a doctor’s visit to get a prescription or the $100 registration fee for a medical license.

Meanwhile, Kris Krane, president of the Mission dispensary in South Chicago, likened recreational cannabis to over-the-counter medications, like ibuprofen.

“Saying we can’t be open for adult-use but we can only be open for medical would be akin to saying that CVS can only sell prescription medication,” Krane said.

On top of that, Krane noted, many people in Illinois simply need “stress relief in a time like this.”

“People might snicker about it, but it’s incredibly important,” said Krane. “People need some way to chill out, to unwind.”

Political sea change

While recreational weed is now considered essential in Illinois, it was still illegal just three months ago. The about-face can largely be attributed to Pritzker, who ran on a platform to end Illinois’ pot prohibition and made good on the promise.

Months before Pritzker announced his candidacy in 2017, his Republican predecessor Bruce Rauner came out strongly against the legalization of recreational marijuana, which he said would be a “mistake.”

Throughout his single term as governor, Rauner resisted multiple efforts to expand the medical program — though he also signed a bill that decriminalized pot in 2016. When he struck a deal with lawmakers that same year to extend the medical program for three years and add two qualifying conditions, he forced the Medical Cannabis Advisory Board to disband, Chicago Magazine reported.

The Chicago Democrats who led the legalization push, state Rep. Kelly Cassidy and state Sen. Heather Steans, first introduced legislation to legalize recreational weed the following year, but their identical bills didn’t gain much traction in either house of the General Assembly.

By the end of Rauner’s tenure, he signed off on an expansion to the program by establishing the Opioid Alternative Pilot Program, which gives people prescribed opioids access to medical weed. But even when he signed that bill, Rauner said he was “very much opposed to legalizing recreational marijuana.”

After unseating Rauner in the 2018 election, Pritzker championed new legislation introduced by Steans, Cassidy and other pro-pot lawmakers that sought to make the state’s nascent cannabis industry an inclusive engine for social change. In June, just over six months after taking office, he fully legalized weed statewide with the stroke of a pen.

For Krane, who has worked in the cannabis world for decades, Pritzker’s latest move to deem pot businesses as essential — which drew virtually no public opposition — is “a sign of how far we’ve come on this issue.”",1

It's been nearly 12 weeks since the first case of the novel coronavirus was confirmed in Washington state, and it's unclear when the wave of infections may subside.

One of the biggest questions for officials who are managing the government response is whether the country has reached the peak. In this Special Report, NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro wraps up the week's best reporting on all of these angles and more. Click ""Listen"" at the top of the page.

The Trump administration is looking at a variety of scientific modeling to try to figure that out. Projections of the death toll vary by the tens of thousands.

""We're nearing the peak of the outbreak,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told NPR this week. He added that he expects ""to see the curve begin to go down.""

But some governors say their states are still struggling to get needed supplies. And critics like retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who helped coordinate military relief in response to Hurricane Katrina, say the federal government can still be more aggressive in centralizing the distribution of resources.

Meantime, as Americans settle into wearing masks in public to avoid transmitting the coronavirus, they also need to look after their emotional well-being. A Kaiser Family Foundation Health tracking poll found that an increasing share of Americans — about half now, up from a third — say their mental health has been affected by the coronavirus crisis.",1

779,779,948,A fund manager who's doubled his competitors' returns for 15 years breaks down 2 stock picks for a market recovery — including the US airline that may benefit most from the crisis,"The Artisan International Value Fund comanaged by Daniel O'Keefe has doubled its peers' performance over the past 15 years.

During a recent webcast, O'Keefe discussed two stock picks he finds attractive in light of the market turmoil.

Southwest Airlines' strong balance sheet gives the carrier an edge over its peers, while UBS is better exposed to high-quality credit, he said.

Click here for more BI Prime stories.

Market crashes are no fun for the fund managers whose holdings shrink in value.

But for value investors specifically, every one of these episodes is an opportunity to find downtrodden companies that become much cheaper compared with their long-term prospects.

This is yet another reason that stock pickers like Daniel O'Keefe prefer their approach over the alternative that buys index and exchange-traded funds.

The Artisan International Value Fund he comanages looks for stocks the market is underpricing relative to their intrinsic or cash-flow-derived value. It has returned more than 6% over the past 15 years, double the performance of its category, according to Morningstar data.

In light of the coronavirus crisis and its impact on market valuations, O'Keefe singled out three of his holdings that have attractive value propositions.

For starters, he is not giving up on US airlines even after Warren Buffett, a godfather of value investing, liquidated his stake in the battered industry.

O'Keefe's fund first bought Southwest Airlines in the first quarter as the pandemic halted most travel. And as an indication of the low-cost carrier's ascendancy, its stock has held up better than every other US airline this year even though it is down 55%.

O'Keefe said one characteristic that should give Southwest an edge going forward is its balance sheet, which includes nearly $4 billion in cash.

""They have the enormous financial resources to survive what I think most people would agree is a temporary and anomalous situation,"" he said during a recent webcast hosted by Ariel Investments.

The airline's other advantages include its exclusively domestic itineraries and extensive network of low-cost flights, he added.

Not every airline with these characteristics may be able to survive the crisis. O'Keefe pointed to Boeing CEO David Calhoun' prediction that a major US airline could go bust this year amid the coronavirus pandemic.

""That will be of enormous benefit to Southwest,"" O'Keefe said, adding, ""They are in the best position to take market share when the others are clearly impaired.""

The second distinctive opportunity he identified is across the pond and in a completely different industry. UBS was the sixth-largest holding in his global value portfolio as of March 31.

He views it as a cheap stock that has undeservedly been painted with the same brush as the rest of the European banking industry.

""It's a wealth-management business,"" O'Keefe said. ""Yes, it has the investment bank. But it's a fairly de-risked investment bank over the last 10 years.""

He added that UBS as a whole did not have as much low-credit exposure as some of its peers. The majority of its credit exposure is to wealthy clients and includes so-called Lombard loans that are secured against a portfolio of liquid assets.

""If you don't want to own a bank, but you want to benefit from the undervaluation of banks, something like UBS is really interesting,"" O'Keefe said.",1

Find all our Lessons of the Day here.Lesson OverviewFeatured Article: “Welcome to the Virosphere” by Carl ZimmerSARS-CoV-2, also known as the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, was isolated and identified by Chinese virologists in January. However, it is only one of 6,828 named species of virus, among thousands, or even trillions, that have yet to be named.
In this lesson you will learn about the history of identifying viruses and how virologists identify and classify viruses today. Then you will participate in a citizen scientist project that involves identifying the different stages of a virus.
Warm UpWhat do you know about the structure and transmission of the coronavirus?Look at the images below from left to right. The first image shows the coronavirus and the second image illustrates what happens as the virus enters a vulnerable cell.
Can you label the rest of the images? Here are some key words you will need to use: viral RNA, viral protein and viral copies.
Hint: The fifth image illustrates a close-up version of the fourth image.
Once you have labeled the images to the best of your ability, check your answers using the original article, “How Coronavirus Hijacks Your Cells.”
As you read the featured article, apply your knowledge of the coronavirus to understand and visualize how other viruses can be identified.
Questions for Writing and DiscussionRead the article, then answer the following questions:1. How do virologists search for new viruses? How do today’s approaches differ from earlier methods of researching viruses?
2. What does the research of Matthew Sullivan, a virologist at Ohio State University, demonstrate about the diversity of viruses in the sea?
3. How did Chinese researchers and virologists isolate and identify the virus that causes Covid-19 earlier this year? How did the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses name the virus?
4. How do viruses infect and affect humans compared to other species?5. Why is it so hard for virologists to classify viruses?
6. Why did Jens H. Kuhn, the lead virologist at the Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick in Maryland, and his colleagues create the “megataxonomy”? How have other researchers responded to his creation?
Going FurtherNow that you know about the process that virologists undertake to identify and classify viruses, you are going to participate in a citizen scientist project to identify the stages of a virus.
Diamond Light Source is the United Kingdom’s national synchrotron. The synchrotron produces bright light that scientists can use to study anything from fossils to jet engines to viruses and vaccines. In 2019, Diamond Light Source began a virus factory and enlisted the participation of the public, as citizen scientists. The first stage of this research is complete; however, you can still participate in the work of citizen scientists to study reoviruses.
According to Diamond Light Source’s Science Scribbler:Reoviruses belong to a large family of viruses that infect a wide range of animals and plants. Some members of the family cause widespread disease, notably Rotaviruses, which are responsible for serious gastroenteritis. In contrast, reoviruses themselves, whilst they pervasively infect humans, do not typically produce symptoms, indeed they are being trialled as possible anti-cancer agents, since they specifically replicate in many cancer cells activated for division. They are therefore a good starting point to try to understand the life-cycle of this family of viruses.Now you will identify and classify the four stages of the virus, following the instructions provided. Once you have completed several tasks, you can look at some of the other biology and science-related citizen scientist projects on Zooniverse and try another.",1
613,613,747,Strict lockdowns have exposed deep class divisions in Europe — but the problem is even worse in the US,"Across Europe, countries are hurtling toward deep recessions.

The European working class will be hit hardest by the economic devastation.

And yet, the European poor will be much better off than their American counterparts, since they have universal healthcare and subsidized wages for people who have lost their jobs.

Portia Crowe is a reporter and writer currently based in Paris.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

A couple of weekends ago, a video of people defying France's coronavirus lockdown and dancing together in the streets of Paris set French Twitter alight. Police arrived and dispersed them peacefully, letting the balcony ""DJ"" off with a warning. But many suggested law enforcement would have reacted differently if the gathering of people, in the gentrified neighborhood of Montmartre, had not been middle class and white.

The incident was particularly inflammatory because it followed several nights of violence in lower-income neighborhoods just a few miles north, where police fired tear gas and rubber bullets towards groups of young people who torched cars and lit dumpster fires. The clashes began after an incident between police and a motorcyclist that landed the latter in hospital, but they were rooted in broader grievances about France's strict eight-week lockdown and its outsize impact on people in the banlieues, or working-class suburbs.

Across Europe, shutdowns have wreaked economic chaos—France just suffered its worst economic contraction since World War II, while the UK is on track for its deepest recession in 300 years. The poor will of course be hardest hit. Already, long lines of people snake through France's low-income neighborhoods towards food distribution sites. But as dire as it is, those people will likely end up better off than their American counterparts. They have universal healthcare and state-subsidized furlough pay. And because most have not been permanently laid off, they'll be back to work when businesses reopen on Monday.

Inequality is rife

Several weeks into confinement here in France, the public health chief announced that Seine-Saint-Denis — one of the poorest, and densest, departments in France — had seen a spike in deaths compared to other areas around Paris. The far-right politician Marine Le Pen accused the government of not adequately enforcing lockdown measures there, while French media snapped photos of crowded sidewalks and described the department's residents as ""undisciplined"" for not respecting the rules. But the banlieues supply many of Paris' essential employees, such as cashiers, cleaners, and garbage-truck drivers. The people seen out and about in Seine-Saint-Denis were likely just going to work.

Not that those commutes are easy. Public transportation has been significantly reduced, and one grocery store employee from Cergy-Pontoise, another suburb, told me the train he takes to work has only been running once every two hours. He said that's also why more people can be seen on the streets in his neighborhood — they don't have many shops to begin with, and have to walk further to access them.

Meanwhile, the wealthy central arrondissements of Paris are quiet. According to data from the French telecom Orange, more than a million Parisians fled the city when the lockdown was announced. Those that left managed to avoid, among other things, the daytime exercise ban — a Paris-only rule prohibiting outdoor physical activity between 10 am and 7 pm. And while some lucky city-dwellers might have backyards or rooftops, most have now gone eight weeks without access to green space because parks have been closed since March 16.

According to Dr. Jennifer Heisz, an expert in brain health and associate professor in kinesiology at McMaster University, not being able to exercise can have serious physical and mental health consequences. Working out makes us more resilient to everyday stressors, as well as preventing stress-induced inflammation, which can lead to anxiety and depression.

But physical activity — and outings in general — have been restricted across Europe. The Italian region of Lombardy banned outdoor exercise altogether in mid-March. Spain did the same, and, for six weeks, also banned children from leaving their homes. Here in France, we are only allowed out once a day, for a maximum of one hour, and can only travel 1 kilometers (0.6 miles) from home. Calls to domestic abuse hotlines have skyrocketed.

Breaking these lockdown rules can get you in hot water. We have to carry ID and documentation to justify being outside in case paramilitary gendarmes stop and question us. As of late April, French police had carried out 15.5 million stops and administered 915,000 fines. But the decision to fine is extremely subjective. For example if you go out for groceries — one of a handful of acceptable reasons for leaving the house — it is up to the officer to decide whether your chosen store is within a ""reasonable"" distance from your home or whether you have abused your privileges.

The fines themselves are indicators of socioeconomic status too. Many of my friends initially shrugged off the idea of getting one (€135 for your first infraction); if they really needed to break the rules, they'd just risk getting caught and paying it. But over the weeks, the law has been tightened. Now, a second infraction can cost as much as €1,500 and a fourth can cost €3,700 — and land you in prison for six months. Again, this matters if certain people are disproportionately targeted.

It's going to be worse in the US

While the inequalities in Europe have been severe, the situation is likely to be even worse in the US.

Here, the shutdowns have at least succeeded in their objectives of flattening the COVID-19 curve. Cases in Italy, Spain, and France peaked in early April and have fallen ever since. By contrast, new cases in the US have plateaued at a still-high level. And despite some state governors pushing to lift restrictions, virus cases are on the rise outside of New York City.

Another major difference is that French medical care is government-funded, rather than provided by employers. The ease with which any tax-paying resident can walk into a medical clinic and be seen by a doctor may have helped boost early detection. And, importantly, those that may have lost their jobs due to the pandemic can still access care, unlike American workers, who, if laid off, will suddenly find their healthcare gone as well.

Relief is in sight on the economic front, here, too. In France, as in other European countries like Germany, layoffs have largely been avoided. Instead, the government directly supported businesses so that they could keep staff on payroll — essentially paying companies to put employees on temporary paid leave instead of letting them go. That means those companies are still fully staffed up and ready to reopen next week. It also means their workers have continued to be paid 84% of their regular salaries.

Meanwhile, the US reported on Friday that more than 20 million people lost their jobs in April and many businesses are disappearing altogether. Government support has been meager, with limited funds to small businesses and a one-time check of up to $1,200 per person.

Some people have, no doubt, slipped through the cracks here in Europe, especially in the informal sector. But things could have gotten a lot uglier. Now, thanks to solid healthcare and temporary unemployment benefits, the worst appears to be over. The same cannot be said for the US.",1
549,549,671,Chicago restaurants’ outdoor patios and rooftop gardens can stay open until midnight — when they reopen,"Whenever the stay-at-home shutdown is lifted in Chicago, restaurants and bars with outdoor patios and sidewalk cafes are likely to open first and be the most popular with people eager to let loose, but safely.

At a virtual meeting Thursday, the City Council’s License Committee turned its attention to those establishments.

At the behest of Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd), the License Committee agreed to let downtown Chicago’s outdoor patios and rooftop gardens stay open until midnight this spring, summer and fall — if they’re lucky enough to come back at all.

For years, Reilly has sought that extra hour to accommodate international travelers who love to stay out late. International travel is virtually non-existent and likely to remain a sliver of what it was until there’s a coronavirus vaccine.

But rooftop garden and outdoor patio business is poised for a comeback, as soon as the shackles are lifted, making that extra hour of business all the more important.

“This is an annual exercise. I’m asking members to once again extend these hours to the hospitality industry — assuming that they are back in business in time to use their patios this year. Assuming that folks will eventually be back to work,” Reilly said.

“This is one more way we can support an industry that is struggling terribly right now with the stay-at-home order and all of the measures we are taking to protect public health. … We also need to provide these businesses the ability to make some extra revenue by adding that extra hour during warm weather months.”

Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia called the ordinance “a solid move” for a struggling industry and predicted big crowds for outdoor patios and rooftop gardens.

“You can exercise social distancing. They just would be more comfortable out in fresh air than outside,” Toia said.

Downtown Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) said he, too, supports the extra hour. But like Reilly, Hopkins wants to maintain the annual review to keep noise under control at places like the hotel in his ward that’s “surrounded on all sides by residential condo towers.”

“Bars and restaurants that have patios, that have outdoor spaces, that have cafes and rooftops — they’re going to be doing more business than bars and restaurants that don’t have outdoor spaces because people are just gonna feel more comfortable. It’s generally safer in an outdoor environment right now with an airborne virus still lurking out there,” Hopkins said.

“Given that, we can anticipate bigger crowds on rooftops, which means more noise. We want them to open. We want them to make money. We want the servers to return to their jobs. But that doesn’t mean we can stop trying to keep some peace so the neighbors don’t complain.”

Noise control was also the driving force behind another Hopkins-championed ordinance approved by the License Committee.

For bars and restaurants violating the ban on live or amplified music at outdoor patios and rooftop gardens, the minimum fine would be increased to $400, though the never-imposed maximum would drop to $1,000 from $5,000.

“I had some patios that were getting such a crowd for their outdoor facility with music, they treated the fines as just a cost of doing business. They had such a good thing going, they said, ‘We’ll just keep violating it and paying the fines.’ I had to do something to increase the incentive to not break the rules,” Hopkins said.

“If you’re outside, the chances are much lower that you’re gonna be exposed to the virus. ... In recognition of that, bars are gonna want to market their outdoor spaces — and that’s fine. There’s no reason why they can’t have crowds returning to their patios and rooftops and still be good neighbors.”

The License Committee also approved a Reilly-championed ordinance prohibiting peddling in parts of River North, the Gold Coast and Near North neighborhoods.

Reilly said the ordinance addresses “some chronic issues we’ve had on very specific blocks and streets. ....It’s not a blanket prohibition for the ward. It’s just a handful of corridors.”",1
701,701,857,"Matt Damon surprises nurse in Ireland, where he and his family are self-isolating in small seaside town","Many celebrities have been posting quarantine content from their mansions in Los Angeles, but one famous actor is no where near the Hollywood scene. Matt Damon and his family are self-isolating in the small seaside town of Dalkey in Ireland.

Since Dalkey is not used to hosting A-list celebrities, the actor has become the talk of the town. Damon agreed to an interview on an Irish radio show, ""Fully Charged,"" where the hosts asked him to surprise a fan who just happens to be a nurse on the front lines of the coronavirus battle.

To kick off the interview, Damon explained that he was in Europe filming a movie when production moved to Ireland but then shut down due to coronavirus.

Rather than fly home, he and his family chose to stay put in Dalkey, and they've been there for about two months now.

""I don't know if you're fully aware that the Dalkey people are protecting you like a glorious gem,"" radio host Nathan O'Reilly told Damon during the interview.

Locals have even created a Facebook group to track Damon — and he's aware of it. ""That's when I realized how great this place was and how protective everybody is here,"" Damon said. ""I had no idea this was happening behind the scenes."" O'Reilly admitted joining the group to try and find Damon for the interview.

The reason Damon agreed to do the interview was because a famous friend convinced him to. U2 singer Bono lives nearby, and while the pals can't see each other face to face due to social distancing rules, they have been FaceTiming. On one call, the Irish singer told Damon: ""You know, there's a local radio station that's looking for you.""

""That was the final impetus for me,"" Damon said. ""I was like, 'I really got to check those guys out and call into the show.'"" The hosts were absolutely delighted that Bono helped facilitate the interview, which they conducted with Damon via video conference.

Damon called Dalkey ""incredible"" and one of the most beautiful places his family has ever been. ""Obviously what's going on in the world is horrible, but for my family, it timed out right,"" Damon said. ""I'm with my whole family and I have my kids and we have teachers with us because we were planning on missing school for about eight weeks. So we have what nobody has, which is live human beings teaching our kids.""

Damon knows this is a luxury for parents in a time of remote learning. He's also grateful that in a time when travel is limited, he's stuck in a picturesque place.

Damon said while most of his family is together in Ireland, his eldest daughter, Alexia, from his wife Luciana Bozán Barroso's previous marriage, is in college in New York City. She and her roommates had COVID-19 ""early on,"" Damon said, adding ""she got through it fine,"" and she will reunite with the rest of the family at the end of the month.

Of course, the hosts couldn't end the interview without asking Damon about ""Contagion,"" the prescient 2011 film about an uncontrollable pandemic. ""You're oddly prepared for this because you were in 'Contagion.' Life is literally imitating art now,"" host Graham O'Toole said.

Damon said has spoken to screenwriter Scott Burns and some of the people who consulted on the movie about the current pandemic. ""Anybody who says you couldn't predict this, just look at 'Contagion.' I mean, 10 years ago we made a movie just by talking to experts and asking them how this would look and how it would kind of go down,"" Damon said.

""The whole thing is just tragic and sad. I hope some good can come out of it. Luckily, this isn't as lethal as it might've been, so maybe this is a dry run for the big one that might come along, because these things do come along every few decades,"" he continued. ""Best to be ready for it.""

To end the interview, the hosts had Damon surprise a nurse who asked if there was any way she could see him. The nurse, Anais, who is from France but lives in Dublin, was shocked to see Damon join the video conference. ""I just can't breathe at all,"" she said.

Damon thanked Anais for all she and other frontline workers are doing. ""I feel like that is the one thing to come out of this — we will never ever ever look at you guys the same. And that's a good thing,"" he told the nurse.",1
726,726,886,"Jason Isbell on releasing his new album during a pandemic: ""I need to feel a connection with people""","Alabama-born Jason Isbell has become one of the country's most acclaimed singer-songwriters. His last two albums debuted atop the country and rock charts and each won him a pair of Grammys.

But he recorded his new album, ""Reunions,"" in what now seems like another time. It will be released Friday, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.

""That's not what I planned on, but I would have been super disappointed if I had to wait,"" Isbell told ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Anthony Mason. ""And I think, you know, people don't need music any less right now than they will a year from now.""

He needs it even more now, he said. ""I need to feel a connection with people.""

On their farm outside Nashville, Isbell and his wife, the musician Amanda Shires, have been hunkering down at home with their 4-year-old daughter, Mercy.

Mercy can tell something is different, Isbell said.

""She even kind of misses being on tour 'cause, you know, she goes on tour with us. So she's said a few times, 'Can we pretend we're in a hotel today, Daddy?' I'm like, 'Yeah, we can do that,'"" he said.

Isbell said he doesn't know when he will be back on tour.

""Sometimes I let myself think about how nice it will be to play shows again with my band and with an audience and ride around and see new things, but I don't stay there for too awful long 'cause then I get sad,"" he said.

He has found this time challenging, he told Mason. ""You know, we lost John Prine a month ago, and that's been devastating for us.""

Prine died of the coronavirus in early April. Isbell and Shires both had performed on his final album, ""The Tree of Forgiveness,"" and had toured with the revered singer-songwriter.

""When John passed, it occurred to me that, you know, there's no such thing as overreacting at this point because if John's loss had been the only one, it would still be enough to keep us in the house for however long it takes,"" Isbell said.

So, he's been performing his new music from the studio in his barn. Isbell has said that he dealt with a lot of ghosts on his new record.

""I didn't know that's what was happening while I was writing the songs,"" he said.

One of those ghosts was his own: the alcoholic Isbell before his recovery eight years ago.

""For the first few years after I got sober and straightened my life up, it was dangerous for me to forgive myself,"" Isbell said. ""Because I didn't want to turn back into that guy.""

""You're okay being with that guy again?"" Mason asked.

""Yeah, for once, and it's taken a long time 'cause, I mean, everybody has that friend that, you know, they can't hang out with 'cause it's like, if I go out with that guy tonight, I'm going to wind up in trouble. Well, that was my own self, you know?"" Isbell said.

Isbell said the pressure to live up to his earlier albums also meant ""Reunions"" had a somewhat tortured birth.

""We could have had a better time, but I don't think we could have made a better album,"" he said. ""And, you know, now the album's done. We can have a good time now.""",1

They also send daily email newsletters to their 25,000 subscribers and are working with local government to advocate for small businesses in New York City.

Amanda Celestino and Marco Shalma explained their marketing strategy and plans to reopen the weekend large public gatherings are allowed.

It's the time of year when weekends begin to fill up with summer festivals, concerts, barbeques, and fairs. But with just a few states in the beginning phases of reopening, most Americans will have to wait for bass-booming and funnel cakes to return to their neighborhoods.

The founders of The Bronx Night Market, a free foodie festival in New York City on the last Saturday of the summer months, are among the millions of entrepreneurs left in limbo, waiting for a return to normalcy. As shelter-in-place orders remain throughout New York City, the season is at a standstill.

In the meantime, founders Amanda Celestino and Marco Shalma are planning their next move and staying in touch with their community, all while supporting small businesses through the pandemic. They host live trivia and happy-hour events on Instagram, and they're sending daily email newsletters to their 25,000 subscribers. The founders are also working with local government to advocate for the small businesses in their community and encourage locals to continue ordering takeout.

Celestino and Shalma remain optimistic, so they've been preparing for the weekend when New Yorkers can finally get back out to socialize — though at that time, attendees may be fewer and farther apart.

Here are the steps The Bronx Night Market founders are taking to engage with their community despite social distancing and the plan to reopen when New York City gets a little ""normal"" back.

Email newsletters invite two-way communication

Part of the team's communication strategy is year-round outreach to engage its foodie community, highlight its vendors and promote local businesses. ""We don't act as if we were a seasonal series,"" Shalma said.

At a time when The Bronx Night Market can't connect with its audience through in-person events, this consistent digital commuicatio is key. A daily email newsletter with 25,000 subscribers spotlights a local restaurant or vendor, gives recipes to make at home, and links directly to merch like tees and hats. It also provides updates on how The Bronx Night Market is helping other businesses during COVID-19.

The founders say they prefer email marketing to actively engage people in a deeper way than a passive swipe up or double-tap on social media. ""There's an action to be made, somebody has to open the email, somebody has to click on that to even delete it,"" Shalma said. ""If you don't have that two-way communication, your brand might as well be dead.""

Stand-out branding in the sea of social media

Without strong marketing, tens of thousands of people wouldn't have gathered in Fordham Plaza for The Bronx Night Market throughout the last two summers. The company uses bright and playful graphics. Its Instagram page is full of ""food porn,"" starring melted cheese, saucy meat, and gooey chocolate.

Shalma said it's important for brands to be ahead of the curve. ""If you're following a trend, you're too late,"" he said.

A post shared by Bronx Night Market (@bronxnightmarket) Apr 5, 2020 at 3:00pm PDT

Celestino said it was key to find a strong brand identity and voice early on, to then follow that consistently so people would know what to expect. ""We were able to find more people who resonated with it, and build a community around that,"" she said.

And that identity isn't just about visuals. Other than Shalma, the mostly part-time and volunteer team is female, which Celestino said is a strength that's helped them connect with their 68% female audience. ""We are all about women empowerment and female entrepreneurship and bettering our communities through that voice,"" she said.

'Small businesses are a big f---ing deal'

Without a definite date to reopen The Bronx Night Market, the two founders' main mission during the pandemic became helping small business owners in their area, especially those who depend on seasonal events and festivals for the majority of their income.

They created an online guide with over 700 local restaurants and vendors offering take-out and specials. They made t-shirts that say ""small businesses are a big f---ing deal"" to donate the proceeds to small business owners and employees in their community.

The founders are surveying business owners to identify and communicate major pain points to local government. They're working directly with Senator Alessandra Biaggi to advocate for those who haven't received PPP loans, unemployment benefits, or SBA disaster loans. They also hope to ease permits and regulations to allow vendors to sell in city streets, parks, and plazas.

Planning for extended hours, lower capacity, more spacing

The founders have a gameplan to reopen as soon as the government allows large gatherings again. First, they'll have to cut their max capacity down to 500 to make room for social distancing, though they don't expect this will impact the total number of attendees. To accommodate the demand, they'll extend the hours of the market and create a schedule of two-hour time slots.

""It's going to be scaled down, but we know that we're going to go a little bit bigger to make sure that it's more attractive, it's more fun, and it's effective as well,"" Shalma said.

They also plan to limit the number of vendors to 20, so they can space them 15 feet apart. They'll also space seating areas farther apart, clean seats and tables regularly, add hand-washing and sanitizing stations, and use barricades and trained volunteers to help with crowd control.

The founders said they've always held their vendors to high cleaning and operating standards, but they plan to host a webinar to train vendors, their team, and their suppliers on their new solutions and operating procedures.

Celestino said she's confident people will be anxious to get out of their homes and socialize from a safe distance once New York lifts its stay-at-home order, which Governor Cuomo has extended through June 13.

""We know that the minute the large-gathering ban is lifted and it is safe, we are ready to come back,"" she said. ""I think we'll see more attendees than we've ever seen before.""

Shalma said it's their responsibility to open the market as soon as they can. ""Don't forget we're in New York and even more than that, we're in the Bronx and people are resilient. We don't have the luxury of being in large homes,"" he said. ""This is our livelihood.""",1
631,631,771,Quibi will add sharing features as the app struggles to find subscribers,"To say that Quibi is off to a disastrous start would be an understatement. Co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg attributes “everything that has gone wrong to coronavirus,” he told The New York Times in a new interview published on Monday. But Katzenberg is hopeful that rolling out new features will help, including giving subscribers the ability to share content from Quibi shows on social media.

When Quibi launched at the beginning of April, the app blocked sharing to platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit. Now, Katzenberg and the team are working on ways to ensure Quibi is “less walled off from the internet.” People will eventually be able to share Quibi content on social media, but there’s no estimated time frame for when that feature will become available.

(Disclosure: Vox Media is partnered with Quibi on two shows and there are discussions for a Verge show in the future.)

“There are a whole bunch of things we have now seen in the product that we thought we got mostly right,” Katzenberg said, “but now that there are hundreds of people on there using it, you go, ‘Uh-oh, we didn’t see that.’”

People also couldn’t take screenshots inside the app. Although that restriction isn’t unique to Quibi (Netflix and Disney Plus deal with the same problem in their mobile apps), without a desktop version of the app for people to watch Quibi shows on, the only way for people to share scenes was to use another phone to record the episode playing. So that’s what people did, managing in some cases to go viral. It’s unclear if people will be able to screenshot or if Quibi will allow direct sharing of clips from the app to various social media apps. The Verge has reached out for more information.

“There are a whole bunch of things we have now seen in the product that we thought we got mostly right”

Another feature coming to Quibi’s iOS app this week is the ability to stream shows and “movies-in-chapters” on TV screens. There’s no further explanation for how people will do this — considering the feature is rolling out to iOS first, the implication would be that it’s using AirPlay. Android users might have to wait a bit longer for Chromecast support. The bigger-screen experience was always part of the plan, but CEO Meg Whitman has admitted in the past that if they knew COVID-19 was going to happen, they might have launched with the feature.

It’s also unclear if or how the “turnstyle” technology — the bread-and-butter behind Quibi’s pitch to subscribers that orients videos based on how you hold your phone — will work if it’s playing on a television set, which cannot be rotated.

Right now, the goal seems to be getting more people talking about and watching Quibi: social media can help turn Quibi shows into viral memes (see: Netflix’s Tiger King), and allowing people to watch shows on their television gives subscribers another viewing choice. Quibi currently has about 3.5 million app downloads and 1.3 million active users, according to Katzenberg.

That’s a far cry from Disney Plus’ nearly 55 million subscribers and YouTube’s more than 2 billion monthly users, 70 percent of which use the app on their phone. Quibi isn’t available globally (like YouTube) and doesn’t have a library of popular intellectual property (like Disney), which makes growth more difficult.

Its shows haven’t received positive reviews, and interest in the streaming service has plummeted since its initial launch on April 6th. Comparatively, most other streaming services have seen an uptick in views. People don’t seem interested in Quibi, and that’s the issue Katzenberg is trying to fix. Whether the novel coronavirus is entirely to blame, as Katzenberg suggested, is questionable. Industry insiders argued before Quibi’s launch that it would be difficult trying to sell a product in a highly competitive market that didn’t seem like it was particularly needed.

But Katzenberg acknowledged the team is far from happy with the results. “Is it the avalanche of people that we wanted and were going for out of launch?” Katzenberg told the Times. “The answer is no. It’s not up to what we wanted. It’s not close to what we wanted.”",1
1069,1069,1273,The psychological toll of uncertainty and not knowing what's coming next,"The Covid-19 pandemic has been going on in the United States for months, and yet many questions still remain. The biggest one for many Americans is: When will life go back to normal? And, what will that new normal even look like? As summer approaches, you may find yourself longing for events that you would typically look forward to, such as vacations, holidays or time spent with your family. On social media, people who are currently sheltering in place expressed that it's challenging to not have anything to look forward to or anticipate. Without these usual benchmarks, you might feel off or sad. ""Uncertainty doesn't sit well,"" Kevin Antshel, clinical psychologist and director of the clinical psychology program at Syracuse University tells CNBC Make It. Here's how to cope with not knowing what's coming next.

Why humans hate the unknown

""The fear of the unknown is possibly the most fundamental fear of human beings,"" Antshel says. From an evolutionary perspective, humans have been able to survive because we're able to plan. We're socialized from childhood to believe that ""there's a predictable universe"" and order in which things should happen, Antshel says. ""Extraordinarily high levels of uncertainty are really against how we've advanced as human beings,"" he says. For example, under normal circumstances, you'd be able to assemble the resources necessary to achieve a plan, and then go implement it. ""When things don't make sense, or they run counter to what it typically is, then we experience these high levels of negative feelings,"" Antshel says.

What uncertainty feels like

We're hand-wired to avoid uncertainty, because it makes us feel lots of negative emotions, Antshel says. The ""vast majority"" of people are experiencing some level of emotional distress or unpleasant emotions during this time, he says. These feelings all come back to uncertainty. ""Fear and anxiety really run hand-in-hand: The more things are uncertain, the more we're going to fear, and the more we fear things, the more we are anxious,"" he says. While planning for post-pandemic life can feel comforting, thinking too much about the future can also increase our anxious thoughts. The more prolonged anxiety is, the more likely it is to manifest itself as depression, which is characterized by a loss of interest in things, hopelessness and helplessness, he says. It can feel like this difficult period will be going on forever, with no end in sight. On top of this, you might find that you're mourning the loss of events that you were anticipating, such as weddings, big work projects or graduation.

(TMU) – If you’re currently stuck at home and facing government lockdown orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic, we won’t blame you if you’re currently fantasizing about the vacations you want to take once the world returns to relative normalcy.

While books, YouTube travel vlogs, and even open world video games offer great distractions, in many ways they also offer serious fuel to our wanderlust – inspiring us to do nothing more than get out of our current environs and delve deep into other cultures, climes, and cuisines.

And of all the most amazing tourist destinations out there, one country stands tall with its dazzling combination of ancient culture and stunning modernity – and that country is Japan.

And now, Japanese officials are reportedly considering a plan that would see the government potentially step up to pay half of the travel expenses of foreign travelers to the Land of the Rising Sun.

However, the plan is merely just a proposal – at least for the time being.

Since the coronavirus pandemic became a global concern earlier this year, the brakes have been hit on global travel – as well as the lucrative tourism industries of various countries.

This has been no less true in Japan, where a mere 2,900 tourists visited the country this April – a vast and precipitous drop from the 2,926,685 people who visited the country last April, according to leading Japanese newspaper The Mainichi. On a nationwide level, the country has seen a staggering 99.9 percent year-on-year drop in tourism.

No tourists in #Japan? No problem. 😎 😏 Cherry blossoms 🌸, Japanese style

🇯🇵 🗾 🏯 More than 1,000 deer 🦌 enjoying the flowers and calm at Nara Park, Osaka. The animals even know how to bow after getting fed crackers by the visitors. pic.twitter.com/MXS3rJ41pS — 𝐏𝐡𝐢𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐨𝐩𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝙋𝙨𝙮𝙘𝙝𝙤𝙡𝙤𝙜𝙞𝙨𝙩 (@PsychologyDoc) May 17, 2020

To prevent the continuation of the brutal collapse of tourism, the Japanese government is now considering giving the green light to a 1.35 trillion yen (over $12.5 billion USD) fund to lure back foreign visitors. Japanese Tourism Agency chief Hiroshi Tabata said that the scheme could begin as soon as July if COVID-19 infections continue to subside.

It remains unclear what exactly would be covered under the plan in terms of airfare or which categories of hotels and lodging.

Japan is currently facing its lowest number of visitors from abroad since 1964. Normally, spring is one of the country’s most popular tourist seasons, especially because it’s cherry blossom season, when the blossoming trees around Tokyo, Kyoto and Mt. Fuji attract thousands of sightseers. This year, however, visitors have largely been restricted to these deer – which, needless to say, doesn’t do much for the tourism industry in terms of generating revenue.

Additionally, Japan has barred entry to nationals and passenger flights from roughly 100 nations. This includes China – one of Japan’s major tourism markets, which had been hitting record highs during the winter amid warming people-to-people relations between the Chinese and Japanese people, who have been plagued by poor bilateral ties in the past.

To make matters worse, Japan has also been forced to postpone the upcoming 2020 Summer Olympic Games that were due to take place in Tokyo.

The country’s other landmarks and attractions have also been temporarily closed, including Tokyo Disneyland, Tokyo DisneySea, Universal Studios Japan, and a number of museums, festivals, and other mass events.

However, in a sign that good news may be on the horizon, only three new coronavirus infections were reported in the capital on Friday – the lowest figure since the government declared a state of emergency in April.

So while Japan is not quite out of the woods yet – as is the case in much of the rest of the world – the reported plan to slash travel expenses in half for tourists does seem tantalizing.

After all, where else can we be treated to the priceless scenery of Japan’s villages, the brilliant natural beauty of the country’s mountains and islands, or the irreplaceable flavors of genuine Japanese cuisine?

Well, this might just be the chance you’ve been waiting for.",0
12,12,28,How to Think About the Plummeting Stock Market,"What investors think the public is thinking is therefore crucial. Whether the costs of the outbreak turn out to be historically large or not, there is a risk that investors’ worries will snowball during this period of uncertainty, leading them to panic-sell and exacerbate any financial damage. “If in the next 20 years [the economy is] only going to be disrupted for three months, that suggests a very small impact on the market,” says Robert J. Shiller, a Nobel Prize–winning economist and the author of Narrative Economics: How Stories Go Viral and Drive Major Economic Events. But the situation could be much worse, and when investors think in “grandiose terms,” Shiller told me, that could “trigger other worrying.”

Predicting the emotional reactions of the entire world population to coronavirus would be a bit easier if investors could turn to the market effects of previous pandemics for guidance. But history provides few indications of what might happen to the economy if the coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease it causes, continue to spread. “This is kind of a new thing,” Shiller said. “It’s too much to ask for the market to get it right.”

The closest analogue is the global influenza outbreak of 1918 and ’19, which killed tens of millions of people. In 1918, the stock market actually did fine—the Dow rose a little. In the years after that, Sylla noted, “the stock market didn’t do much, and while its trend was flat, there were fluctuations within that—some ups and downs, just like we see now.”

But drawing any conclusions from 100 years ago is difficult because, among other reasons, a lot of other stuff was happening then—namely, World War I. Because of that, says John Wald, a professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio’s College of Business, “it’s really hard to say whether [the 1918 pandemic] was priced correctly or not correctly” by the market.

Perhaps a better parallel is the flu pandemic of 1957 and ’58, which originated in East Asia and killed at least 1 million people, including an estimated 116,000 in the U.S. In the second half of 1957, the Dow fell about 15 percent. “Other things happened over that time period” too, Wald notes, but “at least there was no world war.” More recent outbreaks, such as SARS and MERS, were more contained and didn’t wreak as much global economic havoc.

Although the annual flu season is quite different from a pandemic, it does provide a good amount of data for economists to analyze. When Wald, along with the researchers Brian McTier and Yiuman Tse, examined trading records from 1998 to 2006, they found that in weeks when the flu was more widespread, stock-market returns were lower. They also found that when there was a higher incidence of the flu in the greater New York City area in particular, trading volume decreased, which is usually bad for the market.

Two weeks into the reopening of Texas, coronavirus cases continue to climb — along with tensions.

Shops, restaurants, nail salons, cinemas, barbershops, beaches, gyms, offices, childcare facilities, and personal care services are among the businesses that have reopened to the public.

Bars, wine tasting rooms, bowling alleys, skating rinks, and rodeo events will reopen on Friday so long as they stay under 25% of their maximum occupancy rate. Zoos can follow suit next Monday.

Professional sports leagues, including basketball, baseball, football, and tennis, can hold events from May 31, but fans are not allowed.

Regardless of the type of establishment, people are encouraged to maintain social distance, keep their faces covered, and wash or sanitize their hands frequently.

Two weeks after its stay-at-home order expired, Texas reported its highest single-day increase in coronavirus cases over the weekend.

But that's not stopping Gov. Greg Abbott from easing restrictions.

The Texas Department of State Health Services announced on Saturday that 1,801 new people had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours. That surge was partially caused by an outbreak in the Panhandle, where more than 700 cases attributed to local meatpacking facilities were recorded in the city of Amarillo, the Houston Chronicle reported.

As of Wednesday, the statewide tally has risen to 50,564 patients and 1,388 deaths, based on data from Johns Hopkins University.

Texas is one of several states that are relaxing containment measures that states put in place in March. Shops, nail salons, movie theaters, barbershops, tanning salons, churches, and beaches are open to the public.

Restaurants have also been allowed to reopen and can, from Friday, go from 25% to 50% of their maximum capacity. People are encouraged to maintain social distance, wear face masks, and wash their hands frequently.

But two people were hospitalized and around 180 were arrested after a wild ""Go Topless Jeep Weekend"" on Crystal Beach in Bolivar Peninsula between May 15 and May 17. Footage from the scene show people drinking and partying but not much social distancing.

""We been in quarantine, and I need to get out and party,"" Chelsey Coyer told KBMT.

Cases in Texas are surging after the state started reopening

Abbott has defended the fast clip at which the state is resuming business, saying its death and hospitalization rates are lower than in other states of similar size, such as Florida and California, the Associated Press reported.

So far, Texas has conducted 723,013 coronavirus tests, which is about on par with Florida's total testing but much lower than California's 1.23 million tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project. That means only about 2.5% of Texas' 29 million residents have been tested.

Abbott said in a statement that he anticipates the number of new infections in Texas to rise as the state doubles down on testing ""most high-risk areas: nursing homes, meatpacking plants and jails.""

""That is exactly why I established Surge Response Teams,"" he added. ""By immediately deploying resources and supplies to these high risk areas, we will identify the positive cases, isolate the individuals and ensure any outbreak is quickly contained, which is the strategy being deployed in Amarillo.""

Abbott's goal is to open Texas fully.

Gyms, offices, and nonessential manufacturing facilities reopened on Monday, but social distancing is still required, and none of them can exceed 25% of their maximum capacity. At gyms, showers and locker areas will remain off-limits, equipment must be sanitized after each use, and gloves are mandatory.

The governor announced on Monday that childcare centers can resume operations effective immediately, alongside massage parlors, beauty salons, and other personal care services. Youth clubs, including the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, are allowed to hold meetings with no more than 10 members at a time, all of whom must remain 6 feet away from each other.

Abbott also gave bars, wine tasting rooms, bowling alleys, skating rinks, bingo halls, aquariums, and equestrian events the green light to reopen on Friday so long as they stay under 25% of their maximum occupancy rate. Zoos can follow suit on Monday.

Starting May 31, professional sports, including basketball, baseball, car racing, football, golf, and tennis, can hold events, but fans are not allowed on the premises, based on state guidelines.",1
1221,1222,1578,Europe learning the dangers of going back to school after coronavirus,"It’s “one of the most difficult things” for policymakers, said Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. “It’s an impossible balancing task.""

With no easy answers, Europe hasn’t been able to settle on a consistent approach. Germany began reopening schools in April, with older students returning first. In England, it's the opposite, with primary schools poised to begin reopening in June.

In Belgium this week, those in the final years of primary and secondary school began to return to school. Italy and Spain, on the other hand, are treading much more cautiously and only reopening schools in September.

To complicate matters, parents aren’t always on board with their government’s plans. Over 500,000 Britons have signed a petition calling for the right to opt out of sending their children back to school. In Denmark, when schools began to reopen in April, some parents kept their children at home, saying they didn't want them to be “guinea pigs,” Reuters reported.

And it’s not just the children who need to be considered.

“We need to think about the risks of both opening schools and keeping them closed to children, parents, teachers and support staff,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

What all governments are scrutinizing is the science, which they hope will tell them whether it's safe to reopen schools.

When the coronavirus first emerged, it quickly became clear that children were relatively unscathed.

“In every major country, children have been very little affected by Covid-19 if you looked at the overall picture,” said Viner, speaking at a press briefing on May 13. In China, the U.S., Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.K, only around 1 to 2 percent of total coronavirus cases have been in those aged under 18, he noted.

But in late April, as many governments planned their school reopening schedules, there was a new twist: a rare inflammatory disease affecting some children.

The emergence of the syndrome, described as Kawasaki-like, prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare an “urgent need” for more data on the illness. The WHO also said it's “temporarily” linking the syndrome to Covid-19, “based on initial laboratory testing showing positive serology in a majority of patients.”

But to experts such as Viner and Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, the fact that the syndrome is so rare should mean that it shouldn't influence decisions to keep children at home.

“The risk of getting severe COVID-19 in young children remains extremely low, despite this serious condition, which will affect very few,” said Whittaker at the same May 13 briefing. “It shouldn't be a factor ... when decisions are made about when and how to reopen schools.”

Policymakers aren’t just considering whether children get the virus, but how easily they may spread it — a reasonable fear given previous evidence of children being super-spreaders of illnesses such as influenza and measles.

“That’s my biggest fear,” Michael Hoelscher, head of infectious diseases and tropical medicine at Munich University Hospital, told the New York Times.

But the (limited) evidence doesn’t support this.

Ireland’s Health Information and Quality Authority has reviewed the data and found that from the small number of studies identified, “children are not, to date, substantially contributing to the household transmission of SARS-CoV-2.”

The one study that analyzed transmission in schools also showed very low spread, although the review admits that the “evidence remains limited.”





The WHO’s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, told the BBC's ""Andrew Marr Show"" on May 17 that it seemed that “children are less capable of spreading it even if they get the infection.”

But it’s this lack of evidence that was cited by the British Medical Association, the U.K.’s doctors' union, when it supported the country’s National Education Union in its opposition to reopening schools before it deemed it safe to do so, reported the Guardian.

McKee, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, thinks it is ""premature"" to reopen schools in the U.K. as the country's testing system is “problematic” and its contact-tracing system “untested.”

And some U.K. local authorities are ready to take matters into their own hands and refusing to reopen their schools, just as some mayors in France did earlier in May.

Devi Sridhar, professor and chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, believes that local-level data on levels of transmission and daily new cases is needed to inform these decisions.

“This puts information directly into [the] hands of key members of the educational community,” she wrote on Twitter. “Large national decisions [are] not optimal in these situations given variance within a country.”

When to reopen the schools has been the “most delicate” issue, said Marius Gilbert, head of the Spatial Epidemiology Laboratory at Université Libre de Bruxelles and part of the group advising the Belgian government.

It’s not just the risk of transmission increasing, Gilbert told L’Echo. He warned of another danger – that of children being cut off from all social life and being deprived of the structure that school gives them.

Harry Quilter-Pinner, senior research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, agreed, calling this “probably one of the biggest disruptions we’ve faced in the last 100 years in terms of education and schooling.”

For Quilter-Pinner, the key concern is the widening of the attainment gap, which is the concept that children in deprived areas do worse than their wealthier counterparts.

Indeed, data on England from the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds that during the outbreak, students from wealthier families have been spending more time on home learning and have better access to individualized resources such as private tutoring. Their parents also feel better able to support them.

But the problems don’t stop when schools reopen.

“The challenge of reintroduction is not just how do you get people back into classrooms,” said Quilter-Pinner. “It’s how do you build on what was normal to recover and get back to where we were before.”

Returning to school will require significant logistical challenges, with the need to maintain social distancing and have fewer children in a class, he noted.

“As a society, we have choices to make,” said Quilter-Pinner, such as addressing how big the risk of reopening schools is and whether we are willing to take that risk.

Alastair Sutcliffe, professor of general pediatrics at University College London, said these decisions are based on considerations of “various known risks.”

“One of the few positive things to come out of COVID is that it very rarely kills children, especially very young children, especially healthy young children,” he said, adding that in reopening schools, we need to consider this very low risk versus other potential risks to children from not returning to school.

With no clear end to the pandemic in sight, schools will have to be reopened at some point, say experts like Gilbert at Université Libre de Bruxelles: “In any case, you will have to learn to live with the virus.”

1328,1331,1806,JPMorgan study finds COVID-19 infection rates have declined — not increased — in states that have reopened – True Pundit,"A report by JPMorgan finds that COVID-19 infection rates have declined, not increased, in states that have reopened. The eye-opening study from the investment banking institution was shared by CNBC financial anchor Carl Quintanilla in a series of tweets.

Research by JPMorgan shows that the coronavirus infection rates of states that have ended their lockdowns have declined, “even after allowing for an appropriate measurement lag.” The incubation period for coronavirus has a median time of four to five days, and as long as 14 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“JPMorgan has a devastating piece arguing that infection rates have declined — not increased — in states where lockdowns have ended, ‘even after allowing for an appropriate measurement lag,'” Quintanilla wrote of the report by Marko Kolanovic, the Global Head of Macro Quantitative and Derivatives Strategy team at JPMorgan.

“Same goes for various countries, adds JPM. ‘This means that the pandemic and COVID-19 likely have its own dynamics unrelated to often inconsistent lockdown measures that were being implemented,'” Quintanilla tweeted. – READ MORE

309,309,392,"Stopping to smell the roses, lettuces, arugula — on Earth, Arbor days","When toilet paper and hand sanitizer began flying off the shelves, perhaps you thought: Is food next? Should I start growing my own?

A good idea, said Lisa Hilgenberg, a horticulturalist at the Chicago Botanic Garden in Glencoe.

Think of it as “self reliance,” if you like, said Hilgenberg. But it’s also a good way to celebrate Earth Day and Arbor Day — Wednesday and Friday, respectively — while getting outside, even if it’s only to fill a few pots on a high-rise balcony.

“You really learn by doing,” Hilgenberg said. “Start small and just plant something.”

Despite the recent snow in the Chicago area, it’s not too early to begin planting “cool season” seeds outside, including, lettuce, cabbage, carrots, radishes, arugula and others.

“Vegetable gardening is all about timing,” she said. “It’s the perfect time to do that.”

If you’re worried about rabbits devouring the fruits — and veggies — of your labor, consider planting a ring of onions or garlic [which they don’t like] or building a low fence around your vegetable patch, Hilgenberg said.

“Read the back of the seed packet and learn about planting depth and spacing,” she said. “You don’t need a big garden to plant some things you can harvest from.”

It’s also a good time to plant fruit trees, such as apple or pear varieties. They’re best planted as “bare root” trees and when they’re dormant, Hilgenberg said. Consider also stone-fruit trees such as those bearing peaches, nectarines or cherries — but make sure they’re the hardy kind, specially bred to to tolerate Midwest weather.

And it’s not too early to start growing — in seed trays kept inside — “warm season” crops, including tomatoes, eggplant and peppers, among other vegetables. Or if you like herbs, consider dill, oregano, fennel or basil — plants that can be taken outside when consistently warmer weather arrives in late May or early June.

If you’d like some color in your garden, consider nasturtiums, pansies, violets or snap dragons at this time of year.

Mistakes are to be expected among novice gardeners.

“Look at Thomas Jefferson, who gardened for 40 years. And he started over and tried again every one of those 40 years,” Hilgenberg said. “Then he came back with another new tool in his toolbox to attack things in a different way.”

But remember that along with the hard work, gardening is supposed to be soothing — an escape from life’s worries.

“Be sure to remember to stop and smell the flowers and enjoy that beauty, which really is so uplifting — not to mention all the vitamin D you’re getting from working out in the sunshine,” Hilgenberg said.

73,73,114,Bandcamp is waiving sales fees today to help artists impacted by coronavirus pandemic,"Online music marketplace Bandcamp is waiving its revenue share on sales today in order to help musicians who are impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic. The platform normally takes 15 percent of each digital sale and 10 percent of each merchandise purchase. The lifted fees will be in place until 12AM PT tonight.

While streaming music does eventually pay out some money to artists, it can take months and is often divvied up between a lot of parties. Buying music on Bandcamp is a way to quickly and more directly put money in a musician’s pocket, as there are often fewer middlemen and funds are deposited within 24–48 hours of a purchase. Bandcamp’s structure is also unique in that it allows for flexible payments. Artists set a minimum purchase price for music and physical goods, but people are welcome to add more on top when they buy as a tip or gift.

Bandcamp is used by hundreds of thousands of artists, more than 3,000 labels, and has an inventory of over 800,000 unique physical products. The platform says that fans have paid artists $470 million through the platform since it launched in 2007, with $10.2 million paid out in the last 30 days.

“For many artists, a single day of boosted sales can mean the difference between being able to pay rent or not,” says Bandcamp co-founder and CEO Ethan Diamond. “Still, we consider this just a starting point. Musicians will continue to feel the effects of lost touring income for many months to come.”

The Verge noted this yesterday in speaking with musicians looking to Twitch to recoup lost tour funds. A study by the Music Industry Research Association found that the average US musician overwhelmingly relies on live shows for income, and now many are contending with unexpected hardship as many have scrapped most tours in recent weeks due to the pandemic. “The more you can prove you can sell hard tickets, the more you’re worth when you’re booked,” musician Marc Rebillet told The Verge. “I’m sort of scrambling to find a way to keep being able to live the way I want to live.”

For artists, Bandcamp’s announcement also outlines other ways to make money on the platform, including releasing old demos or live recordings, setting up a subscription service, and listing things like video hangouts, lessons, and gear tutorials as merch items.

Additionally, Pitchfork has also listed over two dozen labels on Bandcamp that are directing a greater percentage from sales to their artists, including Hyperdub, Captured Tracks, and Citrus City.

With the announcement, Bandcamp’s website appears to be experiencing higher traffic than usual and intermittently going offline. Make sure to check back through the day if you’re met with an “we are offline briefly for maintenance” message.",1
1223,1224,1582,Italy’s beaches face coronavirus chill,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1

The total death toll since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21 now stands at 32,169 the agency said, the third highest in the world after those of the United States and Britain.

The number of confirmed cases amounts to 226,699 the sixth highest global tally behind those of the United States, Russia, Spain, Britain and Brazil.

People registered as currently carrying the illness fell to 65,129 from 66,553 the day before.

There were 716 people in intensive care on Tuesday, down from 749 on Monday, maintaining a long-running decline. Of those originally infected, 129,401 were declared recovered against 127,326 a day earlier.

The agency said 2.0 million people have so far been tested for the virus, against 1.959 million on Monday, out of a population of around 60 million.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Nhac Nguyen/AFP via Getty Images Nhac Nguyen/AFP via Getty Images

Vietnam shares a border with China, yet it has reported no deaths from COVID-19 and just 268 confirmed cases, when other Southeast Asian nations are reporting thousands.

Experts say experience dealing with prior pandemics, early implementation of aggressive social distancing policies, strong action from political leaders and the muscle of a one-party authoritarian state have helped Vietnam.

""They had political commitment early on at the highest level,"" says John MacArthur, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's country representative in neighboring Thailand. ""And that political commitment went from central level all the way down to the hamlet level.""

With experience gained from dealing with the 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 pandemics, Vietnam's government started organizing its response in January — as soon as reports began trickling in from Wuhan, China, where the virus is believed to have originated. The country quickly came up with a variety of tactics, including widespread quarantining and aggressive contact tracing. It has also won praise from the World Health Organization and the CDC for its transparency in dealing with the crisis.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc recently characterized Vietnam's efforts as the ""spring general offensive of 2020,"" a reference to the 1968 Tet Offensive, which many claim helped turn the tide of the Vietnam War.

Tens of thousands have been put in quarantine camps. By the end of March, Vietnam had banned all international and domestic flights. The government locked down the country on April 1. State-run media say the current social distancing and stay-at-home orders are to be extended for at least another week.

Streets normally buzzing with motorcycles and cars are almost empty in most large cities. As the economic toll of the lockdown becomes apparent, some entrepreneurs are stepping up to help. One has provided ""rice ATMs"" to dispense free rice to those who are out of work.

Some may still be skeptical of Vietnam's relatively low COVID-19 case numbers. The CDC's MacArthur is not.

""Our team up in Hanoi is working very, very closely with their Ministry of Health counterparts,"" he says. ""The communications I've had with my Vietnam team is that at this point in time, [they] don't have any indication that those numbers are false.""",1

In 2019, Florida passed a new law saying that former felons cannot vote until they pay off all fines and fees related to their convictions. Voting rights advocates are suing over that law.

49,49,83,"Gatherings Should Be Limited to 10 People, Trump Says","
This briefing has ended. Read our global live coverage here.
Trump released national guidelines to control the virus.The Trump administration released new guidelines on Monday to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including closing schools and avoiding groups of more than 10 people, discretionary travel, bars, restaurants and food courts.
Mr. Trump, flanked by task force members including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the guidelines would apply for 15 days.
“It seems to me if we do a really good job, we’ll not only hold the death down to a level that’s much lower than the other way had we not done a good job, but people are talking about July, August,” Mr. Trump said about the duration of the crisis.
The new measures reflected the increasing gravity of global attempts to contain the virus as governments around the world, from Canada to Hungary, moved to close their borders to foreign travelers. They left unanswered the question of precisely what individuals and local governments should do, or how business owners and workers might survive financially, at a time when vast sections of the economy were ceasing to function.
“If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now,” Mr. Trump said, “we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we’re going to have a big celebration all together.”
Hours earlier, Mr. Trump told a group of governors they should not wait for the federal government to fill the growing demand for respirators needed to help people diagnosed with coronavirus.
“Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” Mr. Trump told the governors during the conference call, a recording of which was shared with The New York Times.
The suggestion surprised some of the governors, who have been scrambling to contain the outbreak and looking to the federal government for help with equipment, personnel and financial aid.
At the briefing with the president, Dr. Fauci said the first phase of testing of a possible vaccine had begun on Monday. He stressed that some of the White House guidelines were inconvenient, but that they would help stop the spread of the virus and were not an overreaction.
“When you’re dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak,” he said, “you are always behind where you think you are.”
Measures to slow the virus are slowing the economy, too.
It was clear on Monday that most of the American economy was grinding to a halt, and would remain that way for months, because of the coronavirus outbreak and the sweeping steps being taken to try to halt it.
On Wall Street, brokers and analysts were acting as if an economic collapse were inevitable, despite the Federal Reserve’s emergency moves on Sunday night to stoke economic growth through an aggressive bond-buying program. The S&P 500 fell nearly 12 percent on Monday and global oil prices slid below $30 a barrel, a four-year low.
“We’re calling the recession,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “We have the three elements to make that call — a profound, pervasive and persistent contraction in economic activity.”
Business groups, local and state leaders and a growing chorus of lawmakers and economists begged the federal government to spend trillions of dollars to pay workers to stay home and funnel money to companies struggling with an abrupt end to consumer activity.
The administration floated several ideas for helping industry without conveying a clear plan. After the main trade group for airlines suggested a $50 billion bailout, Mr. Trump’s chief economist, Larry Kudlow, said, “We don’t see the airlines failing, but if they get into a cash crunch we’re going to try to help them.”
Employers and employees are torn between fears of being exposed to the virus and fears of running out of money to pay for food and electricity. And government officials are left with the unhappy task of shutting down businesses that provide wages for large swaths of their communities, while wondering what steps their neighbors are taking.
On Monday, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah called for the government to cut a $1,000 check, immediately, to every American.
“People don’t have reserves, they live hand-to mouth,” said Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-winning economist. “People won’t be able to pay their rents, landlords won’t be able to pay their oil bills, the whole system could break down.”
The consequences of China’s harsh measures to halt the virus — restricting the movement of about 700 million people at one point — became apparent on Monday when the government released economic data showing industrial output falling to its lowest level in decades and unemployment rising at its highest rate ever in February.
The Kentucky Derby is postponed until September.For the first time since World War II, the Kentucky Derby will not take place on the first Saturday in May.
The Derby, the first jewel of horse racing’s Triple Crown, became the latest marquee sporting event forced to postpone because of the deepening coronavirus pandemic.
Churchill Downs will hold a conference call on Tuesday morning to announce a makeup date for the race, which is expected to be Sept. 5. The Courier-Journal newspaper in Louisville, Ky., where the race is held, had earlier reported the postponement.
The race, which touts itself as the “most exciting two minutes in sports,” regularly draws more than 150,000 spectators to the famed racetrack with its twin spires.
The coronavirus has transformed the sporting landscape. The N.B.A., the N.H.L. and Major League Baseball have all suspended play, and the N.C.A.A. canceled all of its championships.
Racetracks across the country have been shuttered to the public, but races are still being run and bets are still being welcomed. According to The Courier-Journal, the Derby and the weeks of celebration that surround it infuse the region with about $400 million yearly.
In 1945, the Kentucky Derby was held on June 9, about a month after the government lifted a ban on horse racing that it put in place because of World War II. The only other year the race did not take place on the first Saturday in May was in 1901.
Latin America begins grappling with the virus.
Stringent measures were imposed over the weekend in several Latin American nations, where the outbreak has generally arrived later than in Europe or North America.
In Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro — an authoritarian leader whose government is considered illegitimate by the United States and about 60 other nations — seized on the upheaval caused by the pandemic to present himself as a responsible guardian of public health.
On Monday night, in an announcement made on state TV, Mr. Maduro said a nationwide quarantine would take effect Tuesday at 5 a.m. local time. The country is now at 33 cases, according to Mr. Maduro, who called the move “a drastic and necessary measure.”
Earlier in the day, he responded to 17 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country by ordering a lockdown of the capital, Caracas, and six other states on Monday. “We either go into quarantine, or the pandemic could brutally and tragically bring down our country,” he said in a terse televised speech on Sunday that was a departure from his typically rambling addresses. He called on the United States to loosen sanctions against his government.
Other Latin American countries have also responded to dozens of confirmed cases. Ecuador and Peru announced countrywide lockdowns. President Iván Duque of Colombia shut the borders to nonresidents. In Costa Rica, the government decreed a state of emergency that included closing its borders.
In contrast, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil encouraged mass demonstrations by his supporters against his opponents in Congress on Sunday. Though Mr. Bolsonaro has been close to people who tested positive for the virus, he shook hands and posed for photos with supporters.
Scientists say there are likely 5 to 10 undetected cases for every confirmed one.
Scientists tracking the spread of the coronavirus reported Monday that, for every confirmed case, there are most likely another five to 10 people in the community with undetected infections. On average these people are about half as infectious as confirmed ones, but they are responsible for transmitting the virus in nearly 80 percent of new cases, according to the report, which was based on data from China.
The researchers modeled the virus’s natural spread in China before the government instituted a travel ban and an aggressive testing policy. During that time, from December 2019 through late January, about 85 percent of cases went undetected. That situation is analogous to the current state of affairs in the United States and other Western countries, where tests are not widely available, the researchers said.
“If we have 3,500 confirmed cases in the U.S., you might be looking at 35,000 in reality,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and the senior author of the new report, which was posted by the journal Science.
The report is among the first to address two pressing questions: How many people are walking around with unrecognized infections, and how infectious are they? American policymakers have begun taking more aggressive measures to slow transmission, like canceling events and closing restaurants, but access to tests has been difficult or nonexistent in much of the country.
The E.U. plans to seal itself off from almost all international travel.
The top official of the European Union said on Monday that she was proposing a shutdown of all nonessential travel into the bloc. President Emmanuel Macron of France said national leaders would approve the plan on Tuesday.
“We propose to introduce a temporary restriction to non-essential travel to the European Union,” said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, after a teleconference with G7 leaders. “Of course there will be exemptions for E.U. citizens coming back home, health care workers, doctors and nurses.”
The restriction would last for 30 days, and would not interfere with travel from one European Union country to another. But some of the member states have already taken steps in that direction.
Ten of the 26 countries that make up the passport-free Schengen Area have reintroduced border controls, partly or fully suspending the rules of the flagship European Union program, a spokesman for the European Commission said.
The Trump administration turns on itself.
Infighting, turf wars and a president more concerned with the stock market and media coverage than policy have defined the Trump White House. They have also defined how it has handled a pandemic.
The White House culture that President Trump has fostered and abided by for more than three years has shaped his administration’s response to a deadly pandemic that is upending his presidency and the rest of the country, with dramatic changes to how Americans live their daily lives.
It all explains how Mr. Trump could announce he was dismissing his acting chief of staff as the crisis grew more severe, creating even less clarity in an already fractured chain of command. And it was a major factor in the president’s reluctance to even acknowledge a looming crisis, for fear of rattling the financial markets that serve as his political weather vane.
Mr. Trump has refused repeated warnings to rely on experts, or to neutralize some of the power held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in favor of a traditional staff structure. He has rarely fully empowered people in the jobs they hold.
“Part of this is President Trump being Donald J. Trump, the same guy he’s always been, and part of it is a government he has now molded in his image, rather than having a government as it has traditionally been, to serve the chief executive, and to serve the job of governing the country,” said David Lapan, a former spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon, and a former aide of Mr. Kelly.
Health officials order millions in the Bay Area to “shelter in place.”
Six counties in Northern California have ordered all residents to “shelter in place” in an effort to stop the coronavirus from surging.
The order, which takes effect Tuesday, is expected to disrupt life for millions of residents in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties. The city of Berkeley also issued the same order.
That means staying at home except for the most essential reasons. Officials said people would be allowed to leave the house for essential work, to go to a grocery store, pick up medication, or even walk the dog. But they urged everyone to practice social distancing while outside. “It is now time to do your part,” Dr. Scott Morrow, the San Mateo health officer, said in a statement.
“It’s asking people to go home with their families and to stay there until they are told otherwise,” said Mayor Joe Goethals of San Mateo, adding that only “essential” businesses like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies would remain open.
“I don’t expect anyone to get arrested,” said Mr. Goethals, who said people will still be allowed to go outside for limited activities, like buying food and getting fresh air. “But it’s not optional. This is mandatory for all of us.”
The number of coronavirus cases in the United States crossed the 4,000 mark on Monday, with more than 70 deaths, including the first deaths in Indiana, Nevada and South Carolina.
A growing number of cities and states have taken significant actions to slow the coronavirus, shutting down schools, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and gyms. The restrictions stretched from the now-empty sidewalks of New York City, where officials had made the wrenching decision to shut down public schools, to the fields and urban centers of Ohio. Millions of Americans are now hunkered down at home for the foreseeable future.
France imposes a nationwide lockdown.
Declaring “we are at war,” President Emmanuel Macron of France prohibited public gatherings of any size, postponed municipal elections and told people to stay in their homes except for essential needs.
His order, which goes into effect on Tuesday, is one of the most stringent anywhere in Europe. Officials said that going out for a walk to get some fresh air would be allowed, but meeting a friend on a street or in a park would be punishable with a fine.
Christophe Castaner, the interior minister, said anyone on a public outing would need to carry a document justifying it, even if only a sworn statement written by that person. He said that 100,000 law enforcement officers would be deployed to enforce the order.
Olivier Véran, France’s health minister, said that the government was asking each French person to limit human contact to a maximum of five people a day. France, with more than 6,600 coronavirus cases and 148 deaths by Monday, had already ordered all “non-indispensable” businesses closed.
“We will be able to end the confinement,” Mr. Véran said in a post on Twitter. “But without confinement, we will not be able to end the epidemic.”
Spain, with almost 10,000 cases and more than 300 deaths by Monday, also ordered residents to mostly stay at home, though it is still allowing most people to go to work and has not announced any punitive measures. Schools, restaurants and bars were ordered to close.
The pace of new coronavirus infections reported in Europe accelerates daily — roughly 6,000 on Thursday, 7,000 on Friday, 8,000 on Saturday, 9,000 on Sunday and 10,000 on Monday, bringing the total to about 62,000. France and Spain warned that their health care systems could be overwhelmed.
And in Italy, still the hardest-hit country in Europe and the first to impose nationwide restrictions on movement, the government announced $28 billion in emergency aid to individuals, businesses and the health care system to stave off chaos and financial ruin.
Italy had almost 28,000 infections and more than 1,800 deaths as of Monday.The government’s aid package delays mortgage, loan and tax payments, and offers extended parental leave, sick leave for people in quarantine, babysitting vouchers, and grants for self-employed and seasonal workers.
“We never considered fighting a flood with buckets,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. “We are trying to build a dam to protect businesses, families and workers.”
Ohio governor ignores court ruling and postpones Tuesday’s primary.
Ohio’s governor on Monday night said he and top state heath officials would ignore a court ruling and postpone Ohio’s presidential primary by declaring a public health emergency because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The governor, Mike DeWine, said that the state’s health director, Dr. Amy Acton, had issued the order based on concerns that the coronavirus outbreak placed both voters and poll workers in potential danger.
His announcement came just hours after Judge Richard A. Frye of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas rejected the state’s request to push back voting to June 2.
Ohio was one of four states scheduled to vote on Tuesday. The other three — Arizona, Illinois and Florida — said that they planned to proceed with their elections while taking additional health precautions.
Kentucky also announced that it was delaying its primary.
U.S. airlines ask for $50 billion in emergency support from the government.
The lobbying group for America’s biggest airlines called on the government on Monday to provide more than $50 billion in grants, loan guarantees and tax relief. The group, Airlines for America, warned that the current situation was not sustainable for the industry and that there was no end in sight to the crisis.
“This is a today problem, not a tomorrow problem,” said Nicholas E. Calio, chief executive of Airlines for America. “It requires urgent action.”
The industry group said that flight cancellations are outpacing new bookings and that the decline in demand is getting worse by the day. The request included $25 billion in grants for passenger carriers, $4 billion in grants for cargo, $25 billion in loan guarantees.
On Sunday, United Airlines executives said they were in talks with union leaders about reducing payroll costs. The moves being considered include furloughs, pay cuts and reducing minimum hours.
United’s corporate officers will be taking a 50 percent pay cut, Oscar Munoz, the chief executive, and Scott Kirby, the president, said in a letter. Both have already said they would forgo their base salaries through June.
Reversing course, Britain says to avoid travel and contact with people.
In a sharp reversal, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that everyone should avoid unnecessary travel and contact with others, should work at home and should stop going to places like bars, restaurants and theaters.
Mr. Johnson called the measures “very draconian,” but he stopped well short of the kinds of steps taken by some harder-hit European countries. He did not order schools or businesses closed, did not tell people to stay in their homes, and said the steps were not mandatory, but rather “giving very strong advice.”
Mr. Johnson and his government had faced harsh criticism for its laissez-faire approach to the pandemic. They had spoken hopefully of “herd immunity” — in which many people would be infected, recover and then, it is hoped, be immune — while it was inevitable that many people would take ill and die.
But at a news conference on Monday with top medical officials, he said: “Now is the time for everyone to stop nonessential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel.”
In particular, people over 70 and those with serious illnesses should avoid contact with others, Mr. Johnson said, suggesting that as a result, people should not visit nursing and retirement homes.
The English actor Idris Elba, who was in the HBO series “The Wire,” announced on Monday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, sharing the news with fans in a video that he posted on Twitter.
“Transparency is probably the best thing for this right now,” said Mr. Elba, 47. “If you’re feeling ill or you feel like you should be tested or you’ve been exposed, then do something about it. It’s really important.”

Editor, Health Impact News

An independent media publisher named “Grace” who goes by reallygraceful on YouTube has produced what is the best documentary on the history of Bill Gates that I have seen so far.

I have never met Grace, and Health Impact News does not necessarily agree with all of her commentary (we don’t necessarily disagree either!), but these 3 short videos, which have been very well produced, come with plenty of references to document the things she is revealing, and we will copy the references here as well, before YouTube removes these videos.

Please contact us if the videos do disappear, and we will provide an alternative platform to view them.

Also, the Social Media tech giants are suppressing much of our traffic these days on places like Facebook, and our emails also are increasingly being blocked, so be sure to read my article about how to use RSS feeds to continue receiving our articles.

321,321,408,"Day 19,432 of the lockdown: Kidding, it only feels that way","My mother and I talk every day. Boulder, Colorado, which offered so much when my parents retired there, geez, more than 30 years ago, isn’t quite the jubilee it was. Now in their mid-80s, they aren’t charging up the trail to Wonderland Lake anymore.

It can be a frustrating conversation. Particularly when my mother is planning to go to the store. “Ma!” I’ll say. “Don’t risk your life for coconut shrimp!” Or, when that doesn’t work, “Ma! You’re going to die alone, surrounded by strangers in masks.”

Opinion

My father is sometimes watching television when I phone — CNN, thank God, not Fox — and my mother will mention something on the screen, the latest aftershock from our president’s daily twirl in the limelight, like some demented ballerina on the music box in an insecure girl’s nightmare.

“Don’t watch TV news, Mom,” I’ll say. “I never do.”

That’s true. Primarily because I read newspapers and follow events online, so anything on TV is repetitive. Even big breaking stories — the last time I fled to TV news was when Notre Dame burned. After 10 minutes of time-filling and tap-dancing, I bailed. What’s the point? As for the president’s daily 5 p.m. nervous breakdown ... “Fortunate the person,” Soren Kierkegaard writes, “who did not need to travel to hell in order to see what the devil looks like.”

People who do make that journey, the daily descent, feel obligated to react. This has gone on years, and I’m sorry, but by now those doing so seem merely slow on the uptake. “What? You’re saying that the president is lying?!? Oh, my gosh, that’s awful! When did he start doing that?”

And yet. Sometimes, you must join in. State the obvious. For The Record. Yes, there is something OCD about keeping track of the president’s lies. Maybe it’s like baseball; to ignore even one wild pitch is to lose the fabric of the game. I understand that. Was that a strike or a ball? Hard to determine the next day. You have to pay attention now. Though I bet journalists wish they had decided to keep track of his true statements — a much shorter list.

To the matter at hand.

On Monday, he — no need to speak the name — tweeted this:

“In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens. I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!”

“The Invisible Enemy.” He means the virus, right? Though you can’t be certain, can you?

Three of my four grandparents were immigrants. Maybe yours, too. If they weren’t, then somebody further down the line was. And when those people came over, be they Jewish or Italian, South American or Somalian, you know the riffraff on the pier fancied themselves as better, smarter, worthier, real Americans, because they were here already.

The old lie. His ace reliever. The horse he rode in on: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” His “Look! A squirrel!” fastball. The dogs always go for it, swinging at the heels. Whenever the president has made a botch job of something — and, man, is this a botch — he winds up, lets loose “build the wall” and his followers rush off, tongues lolling.

The good news is his bad idea immediately got watered down, as it often does. By Wednesday, it was nearly meaningless, just another unwelcome fumble at Lady Liberty’s crotch. By Friday, it’ll be nearly forgotten, replaced by a dozen other doozies and head-scratchers, contradictions, excesses, whoppers and jaw-droppers.

I’m not saying ignore the news. With 45,000 Americans dead since Valentine’s Day, and another 45,000 to die, easy, by Fourth of July, that would be irresponsible.

But I recommend a conscious program of distraction. Take your news, then take a break. Wednesday, I got my hands on an advance copy of an upcoming book about Jeanne Gang, the rock star Chicago architect, and her Studio Gang. I immediately began reading — to give you a full accounting before its publication date in June, but also to go somewhere else for a little while. This year, 2020, will always be the year of COVID-19. But 2020 will also be the year Gang’s 101-story Vista Tower opens. Cold comfort, but comfort nonetheless.",1
634,634,774,"Pritzker: Senior staffer positive for COVID-19, so ‘rest of the team, myself included, is working from home’","A member of Gov J.B. Pritzker’s senior staff has tested positive for COVID-19, and all staffers — including the governor — will work from home for an “appropriate isolation period,” the governor announced on Monday.

The staff member — whom Pritzker acknowledged worked “down the hall” from him and attended daily meetings with him — was asymptomatic but tested positive late last week.

All of Pritzker’s senior staffers were tested last week and the Democratic governor and the rest of the staffers have tested negative. Pritzker was tested once again early Sunday and tested negative, his office said.

“One member of my senior staff who was not exhibiting any symptoms has tested positive for COVID-19 and for that reason, in accordance with the best public health practices and protocol, and recommendations of doctors, the rest of the team, myself included, is working from home,” Pritzker said during a briefing in his Chicago home on Monday afternoon.

Pritzker did not disclose the identify of the staffer, citing a potential breach of privacy. But he said the staff member did not attend any of the daily COVID-19 press briefings.

For more than eight weeks, 20 senior members have been regularly reporting in person to work downtown at the James R. Thompson Center. The employees have used safety protocols such as daily temperature checks, wearing face coverings and social distancing.

Those staffers were also not frequenting stores and were being told to only go home and back to the Thompson Center. The senior staffers met at least once a day collectively, and during those meetings they wore face coverings, including the governor, according to Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh.

When it was time to eat, staffers ate individually packaged food, she said. The senior staffers worked at the Thompson Center from about 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. to varying degrees. Abudayyeh said the staffer who tested positive has not been present at Pritzker’s news conferences.

Now, Pritzker will be livestreaming his 2:30 p.m. COVID-19 briefings from his Chicago home, and without any staffers present to help, Abudayyeh said. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the head of the Illinois Department of Public Health, will also join via a video chat. And a print and broadcast reporter will also be added to the line.

The governor’s office is also undergoing a deep cleaning, and staffers are being monitored for symptoms.

“The governor and staff will return to the office when IDPH deems appropriate,” the governor’s office said, referring to the Illinois Department of Public Health.

COVID-19 has also impacted the White House and some of its staffers. Katie Miller, press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence, on Friday was removed from Air Force One after testing positive. Miller is married to Stephen Miller, a top adviser to President Donald Trump.

The Washington Post featured a photo of Katie Miller speaking to reporters Thursday outside a nursing home in Alexandra, Virginia. Katie Miller was not wearing a face covering. Four reporters surrounding her were.

The White House last week also confirmed one of Trump’s personal valets has tested positive for coronavirus.",1
87,87,132,How to apply for unemployment benefits if you are out of work during Illinois’ COVID-19 shutdown,"With applications by state residents for unemployment insurance surging, the Illinois Department of Employment Security has announced emergency rules for those who can qualify for benefits during the coronavirus pandemic.

The giant coronavirus stimulus legislation signed into law Friday provides federal money for the state to provide extra and extended unemployment benefits.

The Department of Employment Security has not yet revised its website to reflect how newly eligible people can apply for the new federally funded assistance, with state officials still working out the details.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at a briefing Saturday a “deluge” of applications for unemployment continue to flood the department.

Under the new federal law, funding will flow to states to help cover gig workers newly eligible for unemployment compensation; 13 weeks of extra payments will be added to the 26 already allowed and, according to Section 2104 of the legislation, there will also be an “emergency increase in unemployment compensation” of “an additional $600 per week payment to each recipient of unemployment insurance or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for up to four months. “

Tens of thousands of workers across Illinois have been temporarily out of work since the outbreak began forcing businesses to close. Last week, Pritzker ordered all bars and restaurants to stop serving dine-in customers, and on Saturday, he issued a stay-at-home order leaving just “essential” businesses in operation.

The result is countless people are now out of work and being forced into the state’s unemployment system. Illinois alone saw more than 64,000 new claims for unemployment benefits from March 16-18, and an unprecedented 130,000-plus claims so far this month, officials said.

To handle this massive influx of new applications, IDES announced it recently adopted emergency rules for who qualifies for unemployment insurance.

Unemployment insurance (UI) basics

In normal times, UI provides temporary income via federal funds to Illinois residents who are unemployed but able, available and actively seeking work each week.

The amount residents can receive depends on their usual pay rate with benefits ranging from $51 to $580 per week. Those approved can receive up to 26 weeks of benefits in a 12-month period.

The new emergency rules adopted during the coronavirus pandemic open up UI to a much larger group of workers. This means many people who wouldn’t typically qualify for UI can get benefits during the state of emergency.

Additionally, under the federal relief bill passed last week, Illinois residents receiving unemployment benefits will receive an additional $600 weekly above what they would receive in regular unemployment benefits until July 31, 2020.

Workers temporarily laid off due to COVID-19 can get UI

Illinois residents who are temporarily out of work because their employer has closed due to the coronavirus can qualify for UI if they meet all the other basic requirements.

The state isn’t expecting anyone to go out looking for a new job during a stay-at-home order: as long as applicants are prepared to return to their job as soon as the employer reopens, they’ll be considered to be actively seeking work and will qualify.

Under emergency rules, these workers will not have to register with the employment service.

Workers who quit due to COVID-19 fears cannot get UI

Unlike Illinois residents who are temporarily laid off by their employers’ closure, workers who voluntarily leave their job over concerns of the coronavirus will not be eligible for UI. The agency says “an individual generally has a duty to make a reasonable effort to work with his or her employer to resolve whatever issues have caused the individual to consider quitting.”

Parents who leave work due to a child’s school closure can get UI

With all Illinois schools closed through at least the end of April, and possibly the remainder of the school year, parents who voluntarily leave work to care for their child can qualify for UI because they “could be considered as unemployed through no fault of” their own.

You must still meet all of the other standard requirements, and unlike workers temporarily laid off due to COVID-19, parents who voluntarily leave work must be registered with the employment service.

Anyone who’s already exhausted UI rights may be eligible for additional benefits

With the passing of the federal relief bill in Congress last week, IDES announced Tuesday that some individuals who have already received their full 26 weeks of regular unemployment benefits in the last one-year period will be eligible for additional benefits during the crisis.

“If you have exhausted your benefits, or you are close to exhausting your benefits, we are finalizing the process to continue benefits under the stimulus package,” IDES said in a Q-and-A posted on its website. The agency says more information will be issued once guidance is provided by the U.S. Department of Labor.

Here’s how to apply for UI

You can call the Illinois Department of Economic Services at (800) 244-5631 or 866-488-4016 (TTY), but users are urged to file claims via the IDES website. And do not go in person: as of March 19, IDES offices are closed to the public until further notice.

To accommodate the massive surge of applicants, the agency has staggered times for people to submit claims:

People whose last names start with the letters A through M are asked to file claims online on Sundays, Tuesdays or Thursdays.

Last names beginning with N through Z should file claims on Mondays, Wednesdays or Fridays.

Saturdays are set aside for people who aren’t able to file during their allotted time, officials said.

People without internet access should call in according to the following schedule, per IDES:",1
1192,1192,1513,"As some states reopen, studying sewage could help stop the coronavirus pandemic","Dinah Voyles Pulver

USA TODAY NETWORK

In hundreds of cities across the USA, scientists hope monitoring systems will provide an early warning if coronavirus infections reemerge as communities in some states cautiously reopen.

These monitors don't rely on testing patients or tracing contacts.

All that's required? Human waste.

Over the past few months, private companies and university researchers have partnered with communities to collect sewage at treatment plants and test it for the presence of the novel coronavirus. The results are reported to municipal governments and state health officials to help them monitor the situation.

Testing wastewater can reveal evidence of the coronavirus and show whether it’s increasing or decreasing in a community, said Ian Pepper, a professor and co-director of the University of Arizona’s Water and Energy Sustainable Technology Center, one of the groups tracking the virus through different municipal sewage systems.

Although they cannot determine the exact number of COVID-19 cases from the wastewater, researchers said they can estimate the potential case count based on the amount of genetic material detected, the number of customers per system and the volume of wastewater generated. They continue to improve upon those estimates, trying to achieve greater accuracy.

They need a better understanding of “how much virus is shed in the stool” when someone is infected, said Newsha Ghaeli, president and co-founder of Biobot Analytics, a startup company formed by a group of researchers with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is heavily involved in the emerging science.

“As our understanding of this evolves, and as Biobot collects more and more data,” Ghaeli said, “our case estimates will be refined.”

When the coronavirus attacks a person’s body, it leaves a trail of castoff genetic evidence that winds up in wastewater flushed from toilets across a community.

Scientists watched this spring as that evidence emerged at sewage treatment facilities in California, Florida, Massachusetts, Paris, Australia and the Netherlands. By sampling the wastewater, researchers detected COVID-19 hot spots days, and sometimes weeks, before those cases appeared in hospital admissions data and clinical testing.

Such early detection – the virus marks the body before or even without the development of physical symptoms such as a fever or cough – is aimed at helping communities better respond to the pandemic. Officials can issue stay-at-home orders to prevent further spread. Hospitals can stock and staff ahead of a wave of patients.

The information can help local governments, many of which are reporting declining COVID-19 cases, spot the first signs of an anticipated autumn resurgence. And it can help them measure the effectiveness of their actions. In Paris, the utility provider reported finding coronavirus particles in wastewater before cases began to grow exponentially, then it observed the quantities decrease as a result of a lockdown.

Hundreds of communities

Promising results from initial studies have spawned widespread interest, and the science is expanding to hundreds of public utilities across the USA through a collection of initiatives.

Most prolific is Biobot Analytics, which worked with local governments to track the prevalence of opioid use through wastewater testing before shifting focus to COVID-19 this year. It monitors wastewater data from 400 communities across 42 states.

Using $6.7 million in seed money and collaborating with researchers at MIT, Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Biobot provides the testing for free.

The company concluded that wastewater sampling in Massachusetts and Delaware indicated a bigger coronavirus outbreak than reported through hospital admissions and clinical testing. In New Castle County, Delaware, the estimates were 15 times the laboratory-confirmed cases.

“This is a high-level way of getting a quick snapshot of the scope of a virus in a community,” Ghaeli said. “We’re hopeful this data becomes very useful in the long run, when we have opened up again, in determining the reemergence of the virus.”

Your guide to COVID-19:What you need to know about the coronavirus

The sewage surveillance, in concert with clinical testing and reported cases, can give officials a broad look at COVID-19 in their community, Ghaeli said. Biobot provides the numbers to participating utilities, which in turn provide the data to officials and health departments, she said.

In early April, the utility in Albany, Oregon, started sharing with Biobot weekly samples of pre-treated sewage from the Albany-Millersburg Water Reclamation Facility.

The weekly sampling occurs alongside routine water testing, meaning little additional work for the staff, said David Gilbey, the city’s environmental services manager. It costs about $120 a week for sample bottles and shipping, according to the city’s website. Results usually come within a week, Gilbey said, and are shared with the county health department.

The research holds “much promise,” Gilbey said. The community has seen declining coronavirus cases and things are starting to reopen, he said. If the wastewater numbers increase, that information would help the utility and local governments “get ready” by adding social distance measures or stockpiling more resources.

“It kind of gives us an idea of what we may be in for over the next couple of months,” he said.

At the University of Arizona, Pepper chairs one of the many committees looking at how to handle the possible return of students to campus this fall. He said the university will sample the campus wastewater for at least a year to monitor coronavirus levels.

In Detroit, officials announced Monday they are refocusing a 2-year-old study with Michigan State University to try to detect COVID-19 in the wastewater. The study was originally designed to determine whether they could track disease-causing viruses in the city's sewer system.

City health officials said the Detroit study found viruses in the sewer collection system about one to two weeks before those same viruses showed up in health department data.

From November 2017 to February 2018, then from October 2018 to March 2019, samples were collected weekly before treatment at Detroit's Water Resource Recovery Facility.

Looking for disease

Scientists hope to promote development of a national wastewater surveillance network to monitor and respond to not just the coronavirus but all kinds of infectious diseases, Ghaeli said.

In Israel, a wastewater-based monitoring system for polio started in 1989. In 2013, when the surveillance indicated a polio outbreak was occurring, government officials swept in with polio vaccines and prevented any cases of paralysis.

Routine sampling for emerging viral diseases isn’t standard practice at most wastewater treatment facilities. Ghaeli hopes it will become permanent and so prevalent that the information is integrated into public health decision-making.

Monitoring wastewater could be especially beneficial as an early warning in a “micro context,” for example at nursing homes or care facilities, where the rapidly spreading coronavirus has been responsible for many deaths, concluded a group of researchers led by Gorka Orive, a biomedical researcher at the University of the Basque Country in Spain.

Even in a larger context, such as a neighborhood or city, the information could help officials adopt more focused and balanced measures, including restricting movement, the researchers wrote in an article to be published in the Elsevier journal Science of the Total Environment. Early warnings, the group wrote, could save lives.

Scientists have studied disease in sewage for years, said Kyle Bibby, an associate professor in civil and environmental engineering at Notre Dame. Researchers in Sweden showed two decades ago that a single infection in one person could be detected in the wastewater from 10,000 people.

As genetic research advances and many groups monitor wastewater for the coronavirus, the science is moving very fast.

“Everyone is sort of learning as they go,” Bibby said.

Bibby’s team works with dozens of utilities, and the research groups collaborate and share what they learn, he said.

More than a dozen research papers have been published, some in pre-print without full peer review, since the beginning of the year.

Additional research is planned.

“This is definitely a community effort,” Bibby said, “through a broad, scientific community.”

In a new study, researchers created a model that uses a trio of biological markers to predict whether a patient was likely to die from COVID-19.

The model was able to forecast the death of individual patients more than 10 days in advance with at least 90% accuracy.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Doctors are struggling to identify which coronavirus patients will develop severe cases that require hospitalization and put them at risk of death.

Newly published research may offer a way to accurately predict a patient's risk of dying from COVID-19. The authors of a study published Thursday in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence created a model that looks at three biological markers — which can be measured in a drop of blood — that can indicate whether a patient's case might get dangerously severe more than 10 days ahead of time, with at least 90% accuracy.

Taken together, these three clues could ""play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention,"" the authors wrote, adding that their model ""provides a simple and intuitive clinical test to precisely and quickly quantify the risk of death.""

A trio of indicators that suggest a higher risk of death

In Wuhan, China, research shows 14%-19% of infected patients became severely sick. Among those critically ill cases, the death rate was higher than 60%.

To identify commonalities between these severe cases, the researchers analyzed blood samples taken repeatedly from 485 coronavirus patients at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 10 and February 18. They tested for myriad kidney, heart, and blood-clotting issues, noted whether those patients had survived or died, then used machine-learning algorithms to look for biological patterns.

The results found that the following indicators can predict whether a patient had a higher risk of death than other infected people:

High levels of the enzyme lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). This is associated with lung damage and the type of tissue breakdown that happens during pneumonia. Lymphopenia, the term for low levels of lymphocytes — white blood cells that defend the body against invading pathogens. An increase in high-sensitivity C-reactive proteins, or hs-CRP for short. This indicates inflammation in the lungs.

Using those indicators, the computer model could predict what happened to the hospital patients 10 days in advance of their clinical outcomes.

""The three key features, LDH, lymphocytes and hs-CRP, can be easily collected in any hospital,"" the researchers wrote in the study. ""In crowded hospitals, and with shortages of medical resources, this simple model can help to quickly prioritize patients, especially during a pandemic when limited healthcare resources have to be allocated.""

A coronavirus 'risk score'

Another study published this week took a similar approach, pinpointing 10 biomarkers that can help doctors assess individual patients' risk levels. That research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday, suggested using these markers to determine the likelihood that a hospitalized COVID-19 patient will become critically ill — admitted to an intensive-care unit or put on a ventilator — or die.

The researchers retrospectively examined medical records from 1,590 patients who were treated in 575 hospitals across China between November 21, 2019 and January 31.

Two of those biomarkers overlap with those suggested in the Nature study: high levels of LDH and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (which is associated with lower levels of lymphocytes).

The other eight risk predictors include a history of cancer, high number of preexisting medical conditions, older age, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, unconsciousness, abnormal chest X-rays, and high levels of bilirubin (a substance in the blood that, in elevated amounts, indicates liver damage).

The researchers used those 10 indicators to develop an online coronavirus risk ""calculator"" that could help predict which hospitalized COVID-19 patients will become critically ill.

That prediction tool could enable doctors and healthcare workers optimize hospital resources, the study authors wrote.

""If the patient's estimated risk for critical illness is low, the clinician may choose to monitor, whereas high-risk estimates might support aggressive treatment or admission to the ICU,"" they said.",1
817,817,986,"Microsoft is teaming up with a $5 billion Seattle biotech to unravel the mystery of how the immune system responds to the coronavirus, and it could help with vaccine development","The range of symptoms and disease severity from the novel coronavirus remains largely a mystery to doctors and researchers.

Microsoft is working with the Seattle-based biotech Adaptive Biotechnologies to better understand the different ways that individuals' immune systems respond to the virus.

The duo are now recruiting 1,000 people for a study that will analyze T cells, a critical component in how human bodies fight invading threats.

The early research could help build T-cell tests, which could supplement antibody testing. It could also better instruct vaccines and therapeutics that are now in development.

""What we're developing is a third pillar of diagnostics, which is looking specifically at the T cells,"" said Lance Baldo, chief medical officer of Adaptive Biotechnologies.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The novel coronavirus has confounded doctors by causing a range of symptoms in patients.

COVID-19 is first and foremost a lung disease, but its effects can include blood clots, heart problems, and even 'COVID toes' that turn purple and swollen. Some patients have mild symptoms, and others get severely ill.

Plus, some of the most critically ill patients appear to suffer more from their own immune response than from the virus itself. The immune system goes into hyperdrive, overreacting to the virus and causing serious damage to the person's own body.

Researchers are now trying to unravel the mysteries about the immune system's response to the coronavirus. A better understanding of how humans react to the virus could instruct future diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.

The technology giant Microsoft has jumped into this work, focusing on a part of the immune response not frequently talked about — at least not yet — with COVID-19: T cells.

Microsoft is working with Adaptive Biotechnologies, a Seattle biotech specializing in decoding immune responses. Adaptive has a market value of about $4.7 billion.

The duo are hoping that better understanding the T-cell response in humans could be help understand and fight the virus. Microsoft will help crunch the massive amount of collected data using its machine learning capabilities and Azure cloud platform.

The two started working together in 2018 to develop a T-cell blood test that could detect multiple diseases, such as Lyme disease. While that work is ongoing, the companies expanded the agreement in March to include COVID-19.

Antibodies have been a research focus for COVID-19 testing, therapeutics, and vaccines

Antibodies have been the star of the show, hogging much of the early attention. These virus-fighting proteins have been known by scientists for more than a century. Going back to the 1918 influenza pandemic, they are the key ingredient in the treatment called convalescent plasma, which helps the sick recover.

Over the last three decades, scientists have developed methods to screen antibodies for potency, then clone and produce the best candidates at massive scale. These antibody treatments are now being developed for COVID-19, with human testing expected to start this summer.

Antibodies have also become a focus of the diagnostic world. Called serological tests, a blood sample can reveal if someone has coronavirus-fighting antibodies. If they do, it likely suggests a level of protection against re-infection. The best serological tests now have extremely high accuracy rates.

Antibodies will also likely play a role in the race for a coronavirus vaccine. Researchers are now trying to figure out the level of antibodies needed in the body to protect against infection. That could be used as an indirect measure to see if experimental vaccines are producing enough antibodies to protect people.

T cells could also play a key role in COVID-19

But antibodies are just one part of the immune response. Another key element in fighting viral infections is T cells.

T cells are the body's first response to a foreign invader in the body. Some T cells will kill infected cells and fight the virus, and others help pump out antibodies and coordinate the body's attack.

While much of COVID-19 research is digging into the antibody response, the T-cell response remains more of a mystery.

To better understand the role of T cells, Microsoft and Adaptive have launched a 1,000-person study across the US. The research is early, and plans to explore how T-cell responses vary from person to person.

They are recruiting people who have likely been exposed to the virus, are infected, and have recently recovered. Volunteers will have their blood drawn and nose or throat swabbed by a phlebotomist who will visit their home.

Lance Baldo, the chief medical officer of Adaptive, said he hopes the findings could help build better diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines for COVID-19.

'Developing a third pillar of diagnostics'

""What we're developing is a third pillar of diagnostics, which is looking specifically at the T cells,"" Baldo said in an interview.

A T-cell test could complement serological testing, particularly if it can help identify some of the gaps in antibody-based tests. It's unclear if every recovered COVID-19 patient generates long-lasting, protective antibodies. If some do not develop a meaningful antibody response, a T-cell test could help figure out who is truly protected, Baldo said.

T cells have mainly been the focus of cancer treatments, perhaps best known for the CAR-T therapies that first came to market in 2017. These ground-breaking treatments fight certain types of cancer using patients' own T cells, genetically engineering them to be more potent.

It's too early to know if there could be a similar treatment for COVID-19. CAR-T therapies are complicated and expensive, with serious potential side effects.

But the T-cell trial could help answer many questions about the coronavirus. Baldo said his researchers are planning to use the data to map the natural decay of T cells. This could help quantify when someone was first infected with COVID-19.

Another potential use would be flagging people that are likely to suffer from an overactive immune response to infection. The research could help explain why some infected people have mild symptoms while others wind up on ventilators. ICU patients have significantly lower levels of T-cells than other patients, some early findings suggest.

A T-cell test could add an extra stamp on the immunity passport

Policymakers across the world are mulling the idea of 'immunity passports.' The idea being that people who have recovered from the virus are likely immune to re-infection, and could safely re-enter the workforce and society.

There are ethical and scientific concerns around the idea. We do not know how long-lasting any type of immunity is. And it could incentivize people to intentionally try to get infected, if the alternative is sheltering inside while others are free to roam.

""Immunity is going to be hard, because for immunity you really need re-exposure if you're going to say that you are immune,"" Baldo said. ""We can impute that someone is immune, but to actually say someone is immune is going to be hard for a while.""

Baldo has reservations about the immunity passport concept, but added if countries do take that approach it likely won't be just one test. Instead, it may require several serology tests along with a T-cell test, for instance, like collecting multiple stamps on a passport.

Adaptive's Baldo said they are hoping to draw some initial insights from this T-cell study in June. The companies have pledged to make the data freely available to researchers. So far, about 100 people have joined and the study is recruiting in roughly two dozen metro areas across the US. More information on signing up is available at immunerace.com.",1

782,782,951,Scottish secretary admits lockdown exit plan ‘could have been clearer’,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1
1349,1353,1841,Why did European leaders’ approval ratings rise during lockdown?,"European leaders have enjoyed higher poll numbers during the coronavirus pandemic despite having some of the highest COVID-19 deaths per capita in the world.

Latest polling data shows governing parties in the UK, Germany, Italy and France have had a popularity boost during national lockdowns.

“This is the most serious crisis that has hit Europe since the Second World War,” said Daniele Albertazzi, a political scientist from the University of Birmingham.

“It is quite well-known that in times of crisis, people do tend to rally behind the flag and the government of the day.”

Some European governments’ use of wartime metaphors could also have helped them to avoid scrutiny and maintain their popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic by convincing people they needed to come together to defeat the virus.

“Governments have been very shrewd and clever in exploiting this and using metaphors that remind people of war-time periods, so the virus has become an enemy that the population has to defeat by pulling together.”

“Right now people on the streets are saying that this is not the moment to have a go at the government.”

Matthew Goodwin, a political scientist at the University of Kent, said that during moments of crisis “voters tend to rally around their incumbents”.

“This is especially likely to occur when voters face a big external ‘threat’, like terrorism and now a pandemic. I think the wartime rhetoric encouraged this, but we would most likely have seen a rally effect regardless,” Goodwin said.

Boris boost?

According to Opinium, the popularity of the UK’s ruling Conservative Party jumped from a 49% share before the lockdown was introduced, to 54 per cent afterwards. The main opposition Labour Party saw its figures drop by 4 per cent over the same period.

The Conservative Party’s leap in popularity could be explained by the rallying around the flag effect detailed by Albertazzi and Goodwin.

But it could also be linked to sympathy towards UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalised with COVID-19 on April 5 — around the time the party’s fortunes peaked — and later spent time in intensive care.

Speaking in mid-March, Johnson said of COVID-19: “This is a disease that is so dangerous and so infectious that without drastic measures to check its progress it would overwhelm any health system in the world.

“I have used the Italian health system, it is excellent, and the problem is not the health system, it’s the numbers of sufferance.

“That is why we announced the steps yesterday that we did – advising against all unnecessary contact – steps that are unprecedented since world war two.

“We must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy.”

Macron and Merkel make gains

Meanwhile, in France, President Emmanuel Macron’s ratings improved by an average of 10% after the country imposed a national lockdown on March 17.

The numbers have fallen over the course of the lockdown, but Macron still enjoys marginally higher ratings than before the COVID-19 pandemic.

During his speech to impose lockdown, Macron repeatedly used the phrase “nous sommes en guerre (“We are at war”).

But the most noticeable increase in support for the government is in Germany, where the CDU/CSU of Angela Merkel has risen, since the start of March, from a 24% to a 38% vote share.

Meanwhile, no other major political party in Germany has seen an increase in ratings, and Die Grunen (Greens) have fallen 7%, according to the survey institute, Kantar Emnid.

How did leaders in Italy and Spain fare?

Support for Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, has also increased, while the ruling social democratic parties in Denmark, Sweden and Portugal had all improved by at least 4% in opinion polls by the end of March.

In Spain, public opinion in Pedro Sanchez’s Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) fell in the week before the national lockdown was introduced on the March 14, but has since slowly improved in April, according to ElectoPanel.

PSOE’s coalition partner Unidad Podemos has nevertheless seen a slight fall in opinion, but support has been steadily growing each week for Pablo Casado’s Partido Popular.

Will it last?

Analysts are suggesting these good numbers for governments will not sustain as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.

This “rally effect” of public support for incumbents “does now seem to be tailing off as voters begin to question their governments,” said Goodwin.

“Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump, for example, are now suffering in the polls more than they were at the start of the crisis. This is important because we know that perceptions of competence -is a leader competently managing an important issue?- are very important to how people vote,” Goodwin added.

“You can see in countries like Italy, Switzerland, and Finland that there has been a short period of truce between governments and opposition or more radical and more moderate parties,” said Albertazzi.

“As weeks go past, people will start realising the enormous financial effect of the crisis and more and more stories emerge about the mishandling of the pandemic and the big mistakes that were made by governments”.

Populists fall but will return soon

Europe Elects data has also shown that a number of populist parties across Europe have fallen in opinion polls.

Matteo Salvini’s Lega Nord has fallen by roughly 4% since February, while VOX España, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and Marine le Pen’s Rassemblement National in France also suffered a decrease.

“Radical and populist parties seemed to have initially accepted that they needed to tone down their criticisms of governments or their opponents,” Albertazzi told Euronews.

But analysts do expect that populists will resume their communications soon, even though there are significant risks.

“It is easy to have a go at governments, opponents or the European Union,” said Albertazzi. “But there is certainly a risk that populists might jump on the bandwagon of criticism too early and misjudge the mood of the public.”

“This is a crisis of such huge proportions that we may still be in the stage where the public and business associations want to see more unity and division.”

But Albertazzi also noted that it is politically important for populist parties to change their stance as soon as possible.

“They have to demonstrate that they have remained fundamentally different from what they see as traditional parties, which they accuse of sticking to the same recipes.

“It is important that the voting public can see populists and radicals as something different, who are not taming their communications strategy.”

“When the immediate crisis passes and politics returns to some sense of normality, politicians are going to have to deal with the hangover,” said Euronews’ political editor Darren McCaffrey.

“More questions will be asked about how they dealt with the health crisis and how exactly they can help their economies bounce back while trying to get public finances in order.”

163,163,222,The first Harry Potter audiobook voiced by Stephen Fry is now free to stream,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, which was released as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone in the US, is now free to stream on Audible. It’s part of a series of initiatives launched by JK Rowling and friends to keep everyone entertained while they’re cooped up at home. Better yet, it’s the version narrated by Stephen Fry, which has previously been difficult to legally access in the US.

As well as making the audiobook available, the series’ publishers are also temporarily relaxing licencing restrictions to allow teachers to read the books to their students in remote video lessons.

There are big debates about whether Stephen Fry’s or Jim Dale’s rendition of the audiobooks are better, but as a Brit who grew up listening to Fry’s version it’s always been the obvious choice for me. If you’re an American who’s never heard it then I’d recommend you giving it a go even if, as TechCrunch notes, you might have a difficult job getting your hands on his recordings of the rest of the books.

As well as Fry’s English version, the free audiobook is also available in Spanish, French, Italian, German and Japanese.

Teachers are also now free to stream themselves reading the books for students

Although Rowling and her team have loosened the licensing restrictions on teachers reading the books as part of remote virtual lessons, there are still some caveats. The biggest of these is that it’s meant to allow the books to be read on closed educational platforms like Google Classroom or Schoology, rather than commercial platforms like YouTube. Teachers are also encouraged to not amend or abridge the books while they’re reading them, which is advice that Rowling herself could occasionally stand to pay a little more attention to.

Meanwhile, if you’d like to listen to the audiobook, then you can do so over at stories.audible.com. Unfortunately the offer is streaming only (with no option to download), so you’ll need to make sure you’ve got a somewhat stable connection to the internet during its nine and a half hour runtime.

301,301,384,Sewer systems are a window into the coronavirus pandemic,"With limitations on COVID-19 testing making it hard to know how many people actually have the disease, some public health experts are turning to the sewer systems for a clearer snapshot.

“Sewage is a source of information on human health, and can really be transformed into a public health observatory,” says Newsha Ghaeli, president and co-founder of Biobot, a startup that analyzes wastewater.

Wastewater-based disease monitoring is a relatively new strategy, but it’s already been able to predict potential outbreaks of illnesses before cases appear. In Israel, for example, officials found the poliovirus in the sewage system in 2013 and mounted a vaccination campaign in response. Research shows that the new coronavirus is found in feces, so it’s a good candidate for this approach.

In collaboration with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Biobot analyzed sewage samples taken in Massachusetts in the middle of March. Based on the amount of virus, it predicted that there were a few thousand people infected in the area. At the time, there were only just over 400 confirmed cases. Currently, there are almost 40,000.

Now, Biobot is analyzing samples from over 100 sewage treatment facilities in 30 states. Ghaeli told The Verge she hopes the data can give local communities a snapshot of their outbreak and help them determine when it’s safe to loosen distancing recommendations.

This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.

What was the company focused on before the COVID-19 pandemic?

We asked as many government and public health officials as we could one question: what is your biggest public health concern? The answer was the opioid epidemic, really across the board here in North America. We focused our first product around that, which was, up until two months ago, one of the biggest public health concerns in the US. We launched our opioid product in late 2018, and from there, we had scaled to about seven communities to sample for opioid levels.

We looked for heroin, fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and a dozen specific prescription opioid drugs. But then we also were measuring methadone and Suboxone, which are substitution therapies, and Narcan, the overdose reversal drug, to understand their update in a community. If a community is opening a new methadone clinic, you would want to see methadone consumption increasing.

Why did you decide to jump in on COVID-19 surveillance?

When the scope of the coronavirus outbreak became clear both here in the US and globally, we knew that as a company we had to respond. That’s why we started Biobot. We started a partnership with a lab at MIT, together with other researchers at Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in order to actually develop the methods and the protocols to measure the virus in sewage.

What did you find when you started examining sewage samples for the coronavirus?

In late March, we published a paper outlining that work on samples collected in the Massachusetts area. We were able to successfully detect the virus and start quantifying the amount of virus that we were seeing. From there, we put forward an estimate of the number of individuals we think are infected with the virus and contrast that with the number of confirmed cases.

We then knew that this source of data would be extremely complementary to data on confirmed patients. Public health departments could use this information to refine their response and to understand the true scope and magnitude of the outbreak. It could also help them evaluate when and how to start scaling back quarantine-style policy policies and recommendations.

Public health experts have other tools to estimate the true prevalence of COVID-19 in a community, like antibody testing, which can hint at how many people have been sick. How does wastewater analysis fit in with those other techniques?

It’s important to look at different sources of data because each different source is painting a separate sort of vignette of the outbreak. We need all of these vignettes in order to actually manage this crisis as effectively as possible.

When it comes to sewage prevalence estimates, there are no privacy implications, and the data is not HIPAA protected. As a result, it can be shared a lot more effectively between response teams, which makes it important as a layer of data.

Another thing that we can think about with sewage data is, for example, why do we have these discrepancies where clinical cases are so low when this data from sewage saws that they should be high? One of the reasons is obviously that individual testing is limited, so not everybody who is sick has access to a test. Sewage testing could also be accounting for individuals who are asymptomatic or individuals with very mild symptoms. Those are people who aren’t even seeking out testing, but they’re still shedding the virus and they’re still using the toilet — so they come up in our samples.

COVID-19 is a problem all over the country, not just in Massachusetts. How are you expanding the program?

We launched a campaign soliciting wastewater samples from wastewater treatment facilities all over the US. This is pro bono. We’re just asking that the treatment facilities pay for the shipping cost for the samples. We’re collecting samples in over 100 locations across the US, representing about 30 states. Almost all the participants are sending weekly samples. The hope is this data is going to start showing where the outbreak is trending, and where we are in that curve.

What are you seeing in that data so far?

We’re generating data on an ongoing basis, and sharing it directly back with the wastewater facilities who have looped in local health departments and COVID response teams. Our data does more or less correlate with the clinical case rankings or hotspots across the US in the limited sites that we are testing.

Is Biobot going to keep tracking infectious disease even after the coronavirus outbreaks die down?

Even prior to the COVID outbreak, we knew we wanted to eventually work in infectious diseases as well as continuing with the opioid product. I think that’s what’s so great about this technology: we don’t need to choose one public health issue over another. We can actually look at data across multiple different public health priorities at once. It’s all contained in this same data source.",1
1367,1373,1896,Racist incidents against Africans in China amid coronavirus crackdown spark outcry,"A sign displayed at a McDonald's in Guangzhou, China, read ""black people are not allowed to enter"" – just one instance of a growing problem in the city. Discrimination based on efforts to contain the coronavirus in China have sparked an outcry in Africa and other places around the world, as the U.S. grapples with its own spike in discrimination against Asians over fears of the disease.

Photos and videos out of Guangzhou show police detaining Africans over concern they could be spreading the coronavirus, CBS News' Ramy Inocencio reports. Images of Africans sleeping on the street after being evicted from their homes have also incited backlash.

Chinese officials maintain that racism does not exist in the country.

""This is denial... of course there is racism,"" said professor Adams Bodomo, founding director of the University of Vienna's Global African Diaspora Studies.

Bodomo, who is one of the world's leading experts on China-Africa relations, said Beijing was ""shooting itself in the foot"" by meeting racism accusations out of Guangzhou with denials.

China's problem with racism is not limited to those with dark skin.

One European woman said she and her family were split apart at a restaurant in China, with her Chinese husband allowed inside while she had to remain outside.

""My husband is inside, eating lunch,"" she said. ""I have to stay outside, because I am a foreigner.""

Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of the California-based Chinese for Affirmative Action, said her group ""vehemently"" condemns reports of racism coming out of China, ""just in the way that we condemn the kind of anti-Asian racism that we're experiencing here in the United States.""

""You're no more likely to carry the virus or be responsible for the virus based on your race, ethnicity or national origin,"" she said.

The number of reported crimes against Asian-Americans has been rising in the U.S., with more than 1,700 instances reported since March. A video that sparked outrage months ago appears to show an Asian-American woman being targeted for not wearing a mask.

""It's really important to not lose hope and to have faith in our humanity,"" Choi said.",0

Since the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the United States on Jan. 21, over one million people in the U.S. have confirmed cases of COVID-19. On April 12, the U.S. became the nation with the most deaths globally, but there are early signs that the U.S. case and death counts may be leveling off, as the growth of new cases and deaths plateaus. The pattern isn't consistent across the country, as new hot spots emerge and others subside.

Click here to see a global map of confirmed cases and deaths.

In response to mounting cases, state and federal authorities have emphasized a social distancing strategy, widely seen as the best available means to slow the spread of the virus. Most states have put in place measures such as closing schools and nonessential businesses and ordering citizens to stay home as much as possible.

It's not clear how long such measures need to be in place to see a lasting effect. In Wuhan, the city in China where the virus originated, a strictly enforced lockdown and widespread testing have slowed the outbreak dramatically, enough to bring an end to the 76-day lockdown.

A large portion of U.S. cases are centered on New York City. Since March 20, New York state, Connecticut and New Jersey have accounted for around 50% of all U.S. cases. As of April 9, nearly 60% of all deaths from COVID-19 have been in these three states. While New York state appears to be reaching a plateau, as seen below, it notched between 8,000 and 10,000 new cases each day between March 31 and April 12.

To understand how one state's outbreak compares with another's, it's helpful to look at not just the daily counts but the rate of change day over day. In the following chart, we display cases on a logarithmic scale, meaning that every axis line is 10 times greater than the previous one. This type of scale emphasizes the rate of change.

When case counts grow very quickly, a state's curve trends sharply upward, as New York's does over the first 15 days past 100 cases. Generally, this is evidence of unbridled community transmission of the disease. As new cases slow, the curve bends toward horizontal, showing that the state's outbreak may be leveling off. This doesn't mean the number of cases has stopped growing, but the rate of growth has slowed, which could signify that social distancing measures are having an effect.

Loading...

In some areas, there are signs of hope. The areas with the earliest outbreaks — such as California and Washington — seem to be having success at suppressing the disease. The outlook in Washington has improved to the point that the state has returned unused Army hospital beds it had received in preparation for a peak in cases.

Elsewhere, limited access to testing may make the number of cases look smaller than it really is. As testing becomes more readily available, we are likely to see the number of confirmed cases continue to grow, even if not at the pace previously seen.

536,536,658,Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders demand Amazon explain whistleblower firings,"Nine Democratic senators are calling on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to provide information on the firing of workers who called for greater protections from COVID-19. In a letter, the senators cite four workers who were fired after raising concerns about safety conditions at the company’s warehouses. Amazon has disputed that the firings were retaliatory, citing other policy violations.

“Given the clear public history of these four workers’ advocacy on behalf of health and safety conditions for workers in Amazon warehouses preceding their terminations, and Amazon’s vague public statements regarding violations of ‘internal policies,’ we are seeking additional information to understand exactly what those internal policies are,” the senators wrote.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ed Markey (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) signed the letter.

In late March, Amazon fired Christian Smalls after he organized a walkout at the company’s Staten Island warehouse, JFK8. Amazon claimed Smalls was fired for violating quarantine by attending the walkout, but Smalls was only placed on quarantine after he started calling for greater safety precautions, and other co-workers with far greater exposure to COVID-19 were never placed on quarantine. A memo later obtained by Vice revealed Amazon executives planning to smear Smalls and make him “the face of the entire union/organizing movement.”

“These safety responses have not been sufficient”

On Tuesday, The Verge reported that a worker at JFK8 had died of COVID-19. At least 35 workers at the facility have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to alerts sent to workers. Two other Amazon warehouse workers, both in California, have died of the virus. Amazon workers at over 130 facilities have tested positive for COVID-19, according to alerts tallied by workers. The company has declined to release statistics on infections.

“Amazon has closed some warehouses for 48 hours for deep cleaning after employees test positive for coronavirus,” the senators wrote, “but these safety responses have not been sufficient.”

The letter also cites the firing of Bashir Mohamed, a warehouse worker in Minnesota who called for greater safety measures. Amazon said he was fired for safety violations and other policy infractions. Workers at other warehouses say social distancing guidelines are being enforced in ways that target workers who raise safety concerns.

Amazon also fired two user experience designers, Maren Costa and Emily Cunningham, after their group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, began organizing an online panel where tech workers could hear from warehouse workers. Hundreds of tech workers subsequently organized a sick-out in protest of the firings and warehouse conditions. Last week, Amazon senior engineer and vice president Tim Bray resigned over the firings of whistleblowers.

Asked about the letter, an Amazon spokesperson disputed that the firings were retaliatory. “These individuals were not terminated for talking publicly about working conditions or safety, but rather, for violating—often repeatedly—policies, such as intimidation, physical distancing and more,” the company said in a statement. “We support every employees’ right to criticize or protest their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies. We look forward to explaining in more detail in our response to the Senators’ letter.”

The senators are asking Amazon to specify these policies and clarify its process for terminating employees. They’re also asking whether Amazon tracks potential organizing at warehouses, as it does with Whole Foods, or documents which workers participate in walkouts and protests.",1
98,98,145,Ford joins Tesla and GM in helping with ventilator and mask supply,"Ford has announced it’s working with 3M and General Electric to make the kinds of ventilators and masks that are currently in short supply as the world battles the novel coronavirus pandemic. The company joins other carmakers like Tesla and General Motors in helping out the medical community, after idling their automotive plants due to the effects the pandemic is having on both consumer demand and the global supply chain.

It all comes at a crucial time. As more people become infected with the novel coronavirus, there’s an increased need for protective equipment like masks to keep health care workers safe and ventilators to treat people with the worst symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Many places are still in short supply of both. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday that help from the private sector won’t be enough, as he asked the federal government once again to intervene.

The need for masks and ventilators keeps increasing

Ford says it’s helping to increase 3M’s total output of “powered air-purifying respirator” (PAPR) masks, and the two companies are also coming up with a new design based on off-the-shelf parts “to go as fast as possible.” Ford says the new design could leverage fans from its F-150 truck’s cooled seats as well as HEPA air filters and portable battery packs for power tools that are already made by 3M. The automaker says it’s still trying to figure out how and where to build these “new-generation PAPRs.” But Ford believes it could potentially help 3M boost production of the masks “tenfold.”

In addition to that, Ford is working with GE’s health care division to figure out how to help the company make a “simplified version” of its ventilators. Ford says these ventilators “could be produced at a Ford manufacturing site in addition to a GE location,” but it did not go into any further detail. Ventilators are already in short supply and will continue to be as the virus spreads and more people develop acute respiratory symptoms of COVID-19.

Ford is also making and testing new face shields to help medical professionals mitigate the risk of becoming infected with the novel coronavirus, which can be spread by tiny droplets in a person’s cough or sneeze.

Many of the United States’ most recognizable companies have joined the effort to help reinforce the country’s increasingly stressed medical care system. Automakers are leading the charge in some ways by getting involved in sourcing supplies and evaluating ways to speed up the production of the most desperately needed equipment, like masks and ventilators. But spinning up medical equipment manufacturing operations is likely to take a lot longer than people like President Trump have made it seem, regardless of whether he invokes the Defense Production Act.

General Motors announced on Friday that it was partnering with ventilator manufacturer Ventec Life Systems and offering the company help with manufacturing, logistics, and purchasing issues to increase its output.

Tesla was able to buy what CEO Elon Musk said were surplus ventilators from China. The company handed more than 1,000 of them over to the state of California on Monday. Musk and Tesla also sent some 50,000 3M-made N95 surgical masks to the University of Washington’s Medical Center.

Other companies like Apple and Facebook are also donating hundreds of thousands of masks to health care workers across the country.",1
1152,1152,1427,Burundi votes Wednesday in presidential election despite coronavirus outbreak,"The two main candidates for Wednesday’s contest are the secretary general of Nkurunziza’s ruling party, Evariste Ndayishimiye, and a perennial opposition figure, Agathon Rwasa.





Nkurunziza, Ndayishimiye and Rwasa were all rebel leaders during the 1993-2005 civil war and come from the Hutu majority group. Both Ndayishimiye and Rwasa have assured their supporters of victory, setting the stage for street protests in the likely event that Rwasa is not announced the winner.

The ruling party has garnered support through social welfare programs, such as free maternal care, but has also been accused by human rights groups of regularly intimidating people into voting for them and using mass arrests to silence anti-government voices. The country’s economy is practically nonexistent, and more than 90 percent of its people rely on subsistence farming, leaving them susceptible to climate shocks.

“The Burundian people are determined to shape Burundi anew,” said Rwasa in a phone interview. “Our agitation is embarrassing the dictatorial system, which relies on harsh measures as if we were in a state of emergency. Despite this negative attitude and all ill treatments, we hope to get the big victory.”





More than 140 members of Rwasa’s party have been arrested since campaigning began on April 27, according to SOS Médias Burundi, a group of independent journalists.

Most foreign media outlets have been barred from reporting inside Burundi. Last Thursday, the government expelled a team of experts and the country’s World Health Organization representative after he raised concerns about large election rallies.

Regional election observers were also barred from monitoring Wednesday’s election as the government said they would have to abide by 14-day quarantine protocols after entering the country.

Nkurunziza’s government has refused to cooperate with the International Criminal Court and the United Nations’ human rights organization. The Burundian diaspora, which generally aligns with the opposition, will not be able to vote Wednesday because Burundian embassies have decided that doing so would breach social distancing measures.





At a recent rally, Ndayishimiye attempted to assuage public concerns about the coronavirus, which has only been confirmed in 42 people there.

“Do not be afraid. God loves Burundi and if there are people who have tested positive, it is so that God may manifest his power in Burundi,” he told supporters.

Ndayishimiye controls the ruling party’s youth wing, known as the Imbonerakure, who act as a sort of quasi-police force, especially in rural areas. U.N. investigators have repeatedly pointed to the Imbonerakure as the perpetrators of brutal crackdowns, citing instances of summary executions, torture, sexual violence and mass arrests.

After Nkurunziza extended his mandate and ran again for president in 2015, the military and Imbonerakure quashed street protests. Over the next two years, at least 1,200 were killed in violence, which the United Nations says was mostly carried out by the state’s various security forces. Almost all of the 400,000 who were displaced by the violence remain in camps, mostly in Tanzania, where they are unable to vote.





“The human rights situation is catastrophic on two fronts,” said Janvier Bigirimana, a Burundian lawyer and human rights activist living in exile in Belgium. “First, opposition activists continue to experience all kinds of violence with total impunity. Second, the government of Burundi favored the electoral campaign while sacrificing human lives in the face of the covid-19 pandemic.”

Rwasa’s rallies have drawn large crowds despite the specter of a crackdown. As a rebel leader, Rwasa was also accused of numerous human rights abuses, but human rights groups have praised his restraint even as hundreds of his supporters are arrested.

“His members have been pretty good about not retaliating in face of arrests and killings,” said Lane Hartill, an American researcher at the Burundi Human Rights Initiative. “Having said that, the temperature is increasing. Everyone’s really on edge.”





Hartill and Burundian activists expressed some skepticism that Nkurunziza would step down, even if his own chosen successor won the election. Nkurunziza adopted the title of “eternal supreme guide” of his ruling party two years ago.

If Nkurunziza does step down, he is assured a $530,000 parting gift as well as a luxury mansion according to a law passed in his most recent term. The law gave some activists reason to believe that he would step down, and that real change, however incremental, might be afoot.

“We want a project of a hopeful society for a destitute population,” said Anschaire Nikoyagize, president of Ligue Iteka, a Burundian human rights organization, from exile in Uganda. “The constant courage and commitment of a population subjected to bloody repression and all the hate speech emanating from the Burundian authorities will lead to a popular revolution if it’s not heard.”

403,403,499,Samsung and LG warn that the worst financial impact of COVID-19 is still to come,"Samsung and LG just reported their first quarter results for the three-month period ending in March, with earnings largely unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, both companies warn that the impact will be felt over the current quarter ending in June. Namely, Samsung and LG expect customers to cut back significantly on TV and smartphone purchases.

In Q1, Samsung’s net profit was down slightly compared to the same quarter last year, but revenue was up 5.6 percent overall thanks to strong demand for its server and mobile components. The company said that some of its customers are restocking their chip supplies because of supply uncertainty, Reuters notes. Mobile profitability was also up, although shipments were down. Meanwhile, LG’s net profit rose 88 percent compared to the same quarter last year, despite sales being down 1.3 percent. LG credited the strength of its home-appliance division for offsetting sluggish television and smartphone performance.

Demand for Samsung’s memory chips is expected to “remain solid”

In the current quarter running from April to June, Samsung and LG both warn of a decline in demand for items like TVs and smartphones. Reuters reports that Samsung expects mobile and TV profits to “decline significantly.” Similarly, LG’s earnings presentation warns of a “sharp” drop for televisions, and for demand of mobile phones to “decline significantly” compared to the same quarter a year earlier.

There are areas where the ongoing pandemic is increasing demand for Samsung’s and LG’s products, however, as a result of people working and studying from home. For example, Samsung said it expects demand for its memory chips to “remain solid” as sales of servers and PCs remain high. LG’s business solutions division, which includes its monitors and PCs, is also expecting strong demand.

Nevertheless, Samsung and LG are expecting the pandemic to take its toll on future results. Samsung said that overall earnings are expected to decline due to a decreased demand for “core products,” and LG said it also expects a drop in both sales and profits next quarter.

With financial markets in turmoil, and countries only just starting to “flatten the curve” enough to consider restarting their economies, it’s hard to predict the future. “There will be some time needed for the real economy to actually recover,” said Jong-min Lee, vice president of Samsung’s mobile unit. “It’s difficult for us to see how much of a decrease in demand we’ll see in the second quarter.”",1

Some changes are bad, some good and some just different,"" said Noble Black, a Douglas Elliman broker who recently listed this nearly $7 million condo in New York City's Upper West Side neighborhood. ""It's really been a conversation with each seller over their comfort level on when to list. We're listing some now and holding many."" Black, who's also had more than $1 billion in career sales, said he expects New York City should see a substantial jump in listings market-wide as soon as the rules are relaxed on showings or when that seems imminent.

""For all the talk of virtual showings, most buyers by far still want to walk a property before buying,"" Black said. ""With everyone at home, we can see that online traffic is up by huge amounts. Some buyers are buying sight unseen, but even those that aren't, are doing their research in preparation for when they can tour a home in person.""

453,453,558,#CancelRent Is New Rallying Cry for Tenants. Landlords Are Alarmed.,"
As unemployment soars across the country, tenants rights groups and community nonprofits have rallied around an audacious goal: to persuade the government to halt rent and mortgage payments — without back payments accruing — for as long as the economy is battered by the coronavirus.
The effort has been brewing on social media, with the hashtag #CancelRent and online video rallies, as well as a smattering of in-person protests, frequently held in cars to maintain social distancing.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, offered a fervent endorsement of the campaign, encouraging her progressive base to embrace a movement to upend the housing market.
“It’s not that it’s impossible to do and it’s not that we can’t do it,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a live video on her Facebook page on Monday. “We lack enough politicians with political will to actually help people who are tenants and actually help people who are mom-and-pop landlords.”
But in New York and other cities, landlords say they too are struggling to pay their bills since many tenants have already been unable to pay rent. They call the advocates’ efforts reckless and say that withholding rent would create cascading consequences, including leaving property owners without the means to pay mortgages and property taxes or to maintain buildings.
Still, from New York to Kansas City to Los Angeles, groups are encouraging tenants to withhold payments on Friday, the due date for May rent, aiming to create pressure for an expansion of affordable housing and tenant-friendly legislation.
To cancel rent and mortgage payments, the federal government would have to take sweeping and possibly unconstitutional intervention in the housing and financial markets, interceding in private contracts and ordering banks and landlords not to collect money.
While the prospect of this happening is low,  the campaigns are less about pushing a particular piece of legislation and more about kindling a mass movement akin to the Occupy Wall Street protests that followed the 2008 financial crisis.
“Rent is not being paid, and the organizing strategy is figuring out how we rally around that and politicize it for our benefit,” said Tara Raghuveer, director of the Homes Guarantee campaign of People’s Action, a national network of local advocacy organizations.
Groups from California to New York have amassed a sizable following of renters who say they will skip May rent. They have also received a boost from progressive members of Congress,  who introduced a cancel rent bill.
“It’s a moment that people are literally rising up for real transformation in the housing market,” said Cea Weaver, the campaign coordinator at Housing Justice for All, a New York group.
Though nascent, the movement has alarmed landlords, especially smaller property owners who say that they, like many of their tenants, also survive month to month.
“When government officials say, ‘Cancel rent,’” said Jay Martin, the executive director of Community Housing Improvement Program, which represents 4,000 New York City landlords, “they are essentially saying that we are canceling the ability for you to pay the bills we are putting on you.”
Mr. Martin said that if tenants’ rights organizers wanted to target a main driver of high housing costs, they should encourage elected officials to cut property taxes. A recent report by the New York City’s Rent Guidelines Board said that about 30 percent of a landlord’s expenses for rent-regulated apartments go toward property taxes.
New York, which has more housing units than any place in the United States, is a city of renters: There are nearly 2.2 million rental units in the city. Mr. Martin said that no landlord he knows would want to evict a tenant in this economy.
“Landlords are being made the scapegoat for all the problems,” he said.Joseph Strasburg, the president of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents 25,000 landlords in New York City, warned that a rent strike would “create an economic and housing pandemic.”
“The city and its residential housing landscape will crumble into an economic abyss worse than the 1970s, when New York was the national poster child for urban blight,” Mr. Strasburg said.
As bad as the economy is, rental payments in April were better than many landlords expected.As businesses laid off employees, property owners reported a steep drop in rent collections, with close to a third of tenants behind as of the first week of April, according to a survey by the National Multifamily Housing Council, a trade group for big apartment owners.
But by month’s end, after stimulus payments and unemployment checks started flowing, the nationwide nonpayment rate was only three percentage points below where it was a year ago.
Still, those numbers probably understate the stress, as various surveys show that landlords have deferred rent, offered concessions or used security deposits to cover missed payments. And tenants have increasingly used credit cards to cover their bills.
Vincia Barber, 39, who lost her nanny job for a family in New York City that decided to move to California during the pandemic, said that she has decided to join the rent strike.
She pays $1,877 for a rent-stabilized apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, that she shares with her 14-year-old daughter. There is mold growing on the bathroom walls, and they cannot open windows because of the stench of garbage behind the building, she said.
“Something needs to change,” Ms. Barber said. “If it’s not now during the Covid-19 epidemic, then I don’t know what it’s going to take for the governor and mayor to do something.”
Rent strike or not, tens of millions of people will be under severe rent stress in May. Looking to rally people digitally, on Thursday, the Action Center on Race & the Economy, which acts as a campaign hub for advocacy organizations, unveiled WeStrikeTogether.org, a website that will accumulate the various May rent strikes into a nationwide heat map.
People who sign up will be directed to a list of resources and be routed to local housing organizations to try and build more support for the #CancelRent campaign.
“The traditional definition of a rent strike is someone who is choosing not to pay for whatever reason, and we’re defining it more broadly here to help people see that it’s a political choice not to help folks who can’t pay rent,” said Maurice BP-Weeks, co-executive director of the action center.
It’s not as if tenants have lacked support: The $2 trillion CARES Act distributed expanded unemployment insurance and the stimulus payments, along with aid to public-housing providers and grants that states can use for rental assistance.
Still, tenant organizers and landlords are pushing for direct housing assistance.Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced the Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act, which would relieve tenants of their obligation to pay rent, transfer mortgages to the federal government and allow landlords to recoup their rent costs — but only if they agree to a vast new regulatory program that includes a rent freeze and the inability to collect back payments.",1
1189,1189,1510,Working during coronavirus: Can I get fired for refusing vaccinations? Ask HR,"Johnny C. Taylor Jr.

Special to USA TODAY

Johnny C. Taylor Jr., a human resources expert, tackles your questions as part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society.

The questions are submitted by readers, and Taylor's answers have been edited for length and clarity.

Have a question? Do you have an HR or work-related question you’d like me to answer? Submit it here.

Question: I have been working from home for about a month now due to the coronavirus. It was fine at first, but I’m beginning to feel disconnected from my work and my team. How can I ensure my colleagues and I remain on the same page? Unfortunately, things are not business as usual around here. – Anonymous

Answer: I’m sorry to hear you feel disconnected. Telework is certainly not ideal for everyone – especially when it’s effectively mandated, rather than freely chosen.

If it’s any consolation, you’re not alone in your remote work difficulties. Forty-one percent of U.S. employees feel burnt out from work during this pandemic as many find themselves working longer hours and struggling to stay connected with colleagues.

In fact, it’s likely your boss is struggling with the same problem – albeit from a different perspective: 65% of employers say maintaining employee morale has been a challenge.

Here’s my advice for you: Communicate, communicate, communicate.

If you think your team is desynchronized, be sure to let your boss know. Tackling this could mean scheduling weekly meetings to discuss projects, housekeeping items or even simple check-ins. Or there may be a better way to share information by centralizing and organizing the tasks and projects you’re collaborating on.

Missing workplace banter and face-to-face interaction? Set up a video call with a co-worker and ask how he or she manages remote work. Odds are, that person may feel disconnected, too, and will be happy to hear from you – and might be able to share some remote work tips. You could even start a group instant message about recommended TV shows, books and movies to enjoy during downtime under lockdown.

Believe me, I understand the difficulties. But as a radical optimist, I can’t help but see the silver lining.

Though we may be more isolated, we’re not alone – the struggle is shared by us all. The teams that see that and come together to create connection won’t merely survive this crisis. They’ll come out the other side better because of it.

Stay strong!

Saying no: How to respond when the boss has a get-rich-quick scheme. Ask HR

At risk for COVID-19:What if you are an at-risk worker and your company won't let you work from home? Ask HR

Q: Can you be fired for not getting the flu shot or other vaccinations? – Anonymous

A: I get this question a lot lately because the whole world is searching for a COVID-19 vaccine and employers want to know whether they can mandate their employers take it once it's available. The answer is complicated, so bear with me.

Generally speaking, the answer is yes. Your employer can require or mandate a vaccine as a term and condition of employment.

For decades, health care and education employers have required employees to take the flu shot and show proof of other major vaccinations – such as those for tetanus, polio or measles – since they are in close contact with vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly and immunocompromised people.

I predict, because of the damage COVID-19 has done to lives and livelihoods, we will see many more employers in other sectors make this a requirement.

There are exemptions under federal and certain state laws protecting the rights of people who wish not to be vaccinated. These exceptions require more than an employee stating a generalized belief that vaccines may be harmful. Some exemptions pertain to religious or philosophical views, though there are also medical reasons – such as an underlying condition – that could put certain vaccines out of the question.

You didn’t mention whether you are personally concerned about required vaccines. If you are, and your job requires vaccination, you will need to have a conversation with your employer about your refusal, your reasoning and whether an accommodation can be made.",1
1354,1358,1851,‘Someone dropped the ball’: Suspect in beating of 75yo nursing home patient was moved to facility AFTER contracting Covid-19,"The 20-year-old man accused of beating an elderly patient in a Detroit nursing home – captured in a shocking viral video – was inexplicably moved to the facility after testing positive for Covid-19.

The young man, who has not been named, was transferred from an Ann Arbor hospital to Detroit’s Westwood Nursing Center last week after contracting the coronavirus, his father told local media. He later appeared in disturbing footage repeatedly punching an elderly man in the face. While the suspect has since been arrested for the assault, it remains unclear how or why he ended up at the nursing home in the first place, given that seniors are among the most vulnerable to the lethal illness.

“He never should have been housed – quarantined – with the victim that he eventually assaulted. That should have never happened,” the man’s father said, adding: “Someone dropped the ball.”

He has [mental] issues and for them to put him in a facility like that, nothing good was going to happen.

Prior to the attack that was captured on video – apparently filmed by the assailant himself – the suspect already faced charges in nearby Washtenaw County, where he is accused of assaulting a staff member at another facility. While acknowledging his son’s severe behavioral and mental problems, the father said he “never would have consented” to sending him to a nursing home had he been informed of it. It is still unknown who made the decision to transfer him there.

Some mystery also surrounds the 75-year-old victim of the nursing home assault. Relatives told local press that they began to worry when they were unable to reach him by phone, explaining that, for reasons that are still unclear, he was taken from his Detroit apartment and brought to the Westwood center. The man is now recovering from his injuries at a nearby hospital.

The incident has sparked widespread outrage, even drawing the attention of US President Donald Trump. The backlash has only been intensified with the latest revelation, prompting a flood of criticism and questions from critics online.

Gosh, it gets worse. The Michigan beating suspect was moved to a nursing home because he was diagnosed with COVID-19, says his father. Suspect also had a pending assault case. The elderly male victim is an Army veteran. cc: ⁦@GovWhitmer⁩ https://t.co/73BWavqS7Z — Andy Ngô (@MrAndyNgo) May 23, 2020

131,131,184,Soccer talk isn’t cheap for Fire analyst Tony Meola,"Some soccer discussion won’t make people forget about what’s happening in the world. The spread of the coronavirus is dominating the news and has halted pretty much all of North American sports.

But talking about soccer — and sports in general — can be a pleasant and worthwhile distraction that allows fans to shift their minds to something more fun. That’s something Fire TV analyst Tony Meola is witnessing from his role on SiriusXM FC’s ‘‘Counter Attack.’’

‘‘Our talk on the radio is just hopefully to give people a couple of hours of an opportunity to listen to something, if they have the time, to get away from everything that you see on TV,’’ Meola told the Sun-Times. ‘‘There are still soccer stories there. People still want to know how teams are getting on and how they’re dealing with all of this.’’

In late March, the soccer chatter should be about the exploits of national teams as they prepare for their next tournaments or qualifying for a big event. European leagues are hitting their crescendos as spring approaches, and the season is just getting started in the United States.

But thanks to the coronavirus, news stories are different. The questions are about whether European leagues can award trophies and how those seasons can finish. In the United States, the Major League Soccer season has been paused and the Fire still are waiting to make their return to Soldier Field.

Of course, there aren’t any games to discuss and most news developments are related to the pandemic. ‘‘Counter Attack’’ is using the time without matches to look back at the first 25 years of MLS. And Meola, a U.S. soccer luminary who was the starting goalie in two World Cups, is grateful for the ability to talk soccer in this unprecedented and scary situation.

‘‘It’s definitely a nice diversion from what we’re doing personally here every day,’’ he said. ‘‘There are not many people that have the outlet to really enjoy very much. I love the game so much. I love knowing what’s going on in the world of soccer.’’

The games eventually will return, and Meola eventually will get back to talking about what’s happening on the field. He’ll be able to analyze how the Fire are doing under coach Raphael Wicky and whether all their new acquisitions are coming together in what is an incredibly important season for the franchise.

His voice, already known from his career in soccer broadcasting, eventually will feel more familiar on the Fire’s WGN-TV and ESPN+ broadcasts. Meola also will get back to working with frequent partner and Fire play-by-play announcer Tyler Terens, then with Arlo White when his schedule allows.

When that’s happening is unclear. Meola, however, is eager for the restart.

‘‘I can’t wait to call a live game,’’ Meola said. ‘‘I can’t wait to analyze a Champions League game on the radio. I can’t wait to get back in the booth and do a Fire game, an MLS game. That’s the most fun you have in this business. I’m looking forward to that day.’’",1
1115,1115,1350,Russia’s first-ever case of genital mutilation committed against 9-year-old girl is still pending,"Russiaâs first-ever case of female genital mutilation is still pending

The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Republic of Ingushetia is looking into the appeal submitted from the Legal Initiative project with a request to investigate into the case of female circumcision, when a nine-year-old girl was circumcised at a local private clinic.

Doctors, medical personnel and administration of “Aybolit” clinic can be prosecuted for causing harm to health, committing sexual acts and providing unsafe services with a view to receive financial profit.

The victim’s mother said that she had separated from the child’s father a long time ago and kept the children. On June 21, 2019, the woman’s ex-spouse took his son and daughter to his house for the weekend. The next day, the boy called his mother and said that his sister returned home in blood and tearful. It turned out that the girl’s stepmother, her father’s second wife, took the little girl to Aybolit clinic in the city of Magas. Children's gynecologist Izanya Nalgieva conducted the circumcision procedure against the girl’s will. The girl’s grandmother said with reference to what her granddaughter told her, that the child was screaming and trying to break free, but her stepmother and clinic employee were holding her arms and legs. The adults were telling her that it was a common procedure for every girl, that she was not going to die.

There was no legal representative with the child at the moment of surgery. No one signed the consent for the surgery either. The doctor had no right to touch the patient.

On June 27, 2019, the girl’s mother went to the Investigative Committee Directorate for Chechnya (at her place of residence). A criminal case was filed against the children’s gynecologist under Part 1 of Art. 115 of the Criminal Code (intentional infliction of insignificant bodily harm, which caused a short-term health disorder or an insignificant loss of general earning capacity).

The gynecologist, a week after the incident, admitted the case of circumcision. However, an extract from the interrogation protocol states that ""the child’s parents agreed to skin incision in the area of the clitoris, after which the procedure was performed.""

A forensic medical examination established that the girl had “a 6x5 millimeter cut wound on her external genitalia.”

Later, during an interrogation, children's gynecologist Nalgieva stated that she simply provided the girl with medical care and did not perform any surgery. ""I read my protocol inattentively and erroneously indicated that the ritual of circumcision was performed. At that time I did not have all that information memorized, because I did not have the health record available to me,” explained Nalgieva.

A representative of the clinic, Beslan Matiev, denied all the charges and said that the girl’s family simply wanted to make money on the reputation of the clinic. When the affected party produced the price list of the clinic, where circumcision was listed in the “gynecology” section with a price of 2,000 rubles, Matiev said that the price list had been “corrected” because the clinic had no position for female circumcisions.

Ingushetia’s Commissioner for Human Rights, Dzhambulat Ozdoev, stated that he was ready to consider the statement from the girl’s family. “Of course, something needs to be done. So far we only have information from the Internet – this is the only case of the procedure,” the official said.

The trial of children’s gynecologist Nalgieva began in late 2019 and was the first incident in the Russian judicial system, when a case of female genital mutilation was considered in court. The trial is still pending. The judge repeatedly proposed reconciliation of the parties, but it did not take place, and the court hearings continued until the introduction of restrictive measures in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. The trial is to resume after the lockdown measures are lifted.

Representatives of the Ministry of Health of Ingushetia later announced that such surgeries are not conducted in public medical organizations of the republic, while the ministry does not regulate the activities of private clinics.

According to international standards, female genital mutilation may lead to extremely negative consequences for women's reproductive, psychological and sexual health. The UN and the WHO repeatedly called female genital mutilation a violation of the right to health and freedom from torture.

The European Court of Human Rights recognizes female genital mutilation as torture that violates Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The Russian Council of Muftis, in turn, explained that female circumcision was alien to Islam, that it was a ""pre-Islamic tradition"", while subduing the lust of the flesh was a matter of moral guidelines of a person.",0
1319,1322,1796,France sets date for second round of local elections,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1
577,577,707,"Senators probe Medline about ‘Project Air Bridge,’ say ‘the American people need an explanation’","Two U.S. senators are probing Northfield-based Medline Industries as well as other firms involved in a Trump administration venture branded “Project Air Bridge,” which flies in to the U.S. vital COVID-19 medical supplies that are in short supply.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal say the program operates “with little to no transparency.”

Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who ran for president, tweeted on April 27: “Project Air Bridge is Jared Kushner’s secretive public-private partnership for COVID-19 supplies – but it’s failing. States can’t get equipment & nobody’s explaining how the project works. @SenBlumenthal & I want answers from the participating suppliers.”

That same day, Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, tweeted: “Trump seems to be playing politics again with public health — misdistributing scarce medical supplies. @SenWarren & I demand transparency on Project Air Bridge & how it works.”

Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a White House senior adviser, is identified in a variety of news reports as the central player in launching Project Air Bridge in March. A key feature is using companies, including Medline, to distribute the medical supplies nationwide.

The senators are pressing Medline for a list of all supplies delivered via Project Air Bridge and all recipients, whether state or local governments, hospitals or medical systems or other clients.

Medline Industries CEO Charlie Mills was at the White House on March 29 for a meeting of coronavirus supply chain distributors with President Donald Trump. The firm is among the nation’s largest privately-held health care manufacturers and distributors.

The firm — once in the news for its ethylene oxide environmental issues at its Waukegan sterilization facility — is making masks, gloves and sanitizers in Lake County. The Waukegan facility is now reopened and with new emissions control equipment is sterilizing the high- grade N95 masks in short supply.

On April 27, Warren and Blumenthal sent a letter to Mills, asking about “your company’s interactions” with the White House Coronavirus Task Force, the Federal Emergency Management Agency “and other executive branch entities distributing medical supplies during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.”

The letter also stated that “the American people need an explanation for how these supplies are obtained, priced, and distributed through Project Air Bridge. Unfortunately, neither the administration nor your company has explained critical details, such as the content of any existing contracts or financial agreements.”

“Between reports of shortages across the country, seizures of supplies by the government, and outrageous prices, there is an extraordinary level of confusion and dismay about the current state of the medical supply chain.”

The senators told the executives the administration is “stonewalling” about Project Air Bridge and requested supply chain information the companies are in a position to know.

The senators wanted replies by Friday. Medline spokesman Jesse Greenberg told the Chicago Sun-Times on Friday, “I decline to respond at this time.”

Similar letters were sent to executives of five other Project Air Bridge companies: Cardinal Health; Concordance Healthcare Solutions; Henry Schein; McKesson; and Owens and Minor.

As of May 4, Project Air Bridge completed 112 international flights, with another 23 ready to go, according to the Department of Homeland Security. O’Hare Airport is among the destinations.

No shipments included goods intended for distribution by the state of Illinois. “We have not received anything directly from Project Air Bridge,” Jordan Abudayyeh, a spokesman for Gov. J.B. Pritzker, told the Sun-Times.

Pritzker has been in the spotlight for airlifting urgently needed supplies from overseas suppliers in cloak-and-dagger operations to avoid having items headed for the state end up sidetracked to federal supply chains.

The Trump White House frequently brags about the amount of desperately needed medical supplies from Asia that are flown into the U.S. instead of coming by ship, which is slower.

Warren and Blumenthal are concerned about how the goods are distributed, the financial relationships with the companies involved and the potential for profiteering.

The federal government pays for the supplies — masks, face shields, gowns, gloves — as well as the air freight.

According to FEMA, Medline and the other Project Air Bridge companies are required to make a priority of selling 50% of the supplies to clients in “hot spots” with the firms free to sell the rest through their “traditional channels.”

The senators in their letter asked how Medline was “selected as a participant in Project Air Bridge” as well as information about contracts or agreements.

The letter also asks what costs Medline pays “for the federal government’s transport of these items, and how does it compare to your typical costs for obtaining items from suppliers” and “how has your company distributed medical supplies” and personal protection equipment.",1

135,135,189,Covid-19 coronavirus temperature limits: Climate does not matter,"Covid-19 coronavirus temperature limits: Climate does not matter

Scientists from the University of Hong Kong have found at which temperatures the novel coronavirus remains most and least active. According to them, the virus remains highly stable for a long time at a temperature of about +4 degrees Celsius. In the absence of disinfection, its activity begins to decline only after 14 days.



COVID-19 is very sensitive to high temperatures: it dies within five minutes at +70 °C. At +56 ° C, the virus remains active for less than half an hour, at +37 degrees - for no more than two days, and at a temperature of 22 degrees - for about a week.

Scientists find how long coronavirus can live on various surfaces

On the outer side of medical masks the virus lives for at least a week at room temperature and relative humidity of 65 percent. Coronavirus stays on paper for less than three hours, on wooden surfaces and fabrics - for not more than two days, on glass - for less than four days, on stainless steel and plastic - for no longer than a week.



It is worthy of note that reusable face masks made of fabric, which many people tend to use nowadays instead of disposable medical masks (or due to the shortage of them) can be used repeatedly only after meticulous disinfection. As with disposable medical masks, cloth masks need to be changed every two to three hours of constant use.

At home, cloth masks need to be washed with soap or detergent and then treated with a steam generator or steam iron.

After disinfection, one should press the mask with hot iron without steaming it to kill all the germs that can live in moist fabric.

As medical specialists all over the world emphasize, such masks are intended primarily for sick individuals in the first place. They can be effective only in combination with other prophylactic measures (avoiding contact, frequent washing of hands, disinfection of items and surfaces, etc.). In addition, the mask should be worn by people who provide medical care for sick individuals.



Healthy people can wear the mask when visiting public places, using public transport, but the effectiveness of the mask in such situations has not been proven. Disposable medical masks made of non-woven material should not be reused or disinfected.

Coronavirus pandemic to end this summer?

Specialists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that 90% of cases of COVID-19 infection occurred at temperatures ranging from 3 to 17°C and absolute humidity from 4 to 9 g/m³. If their assumption is correct, warm and humid weather in the coming months may improve the situation in many countries of the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the situation in the countries of the Southern Hemisphere may worsen. However, this does not mean that coronavirus will not spread in countries with warm and humid climate.



For example, in Thailand, where temperatures remain at about 30 degrees Centigrade all the year round, coronavirus remains active and tough measures to combat it. At the same time, the novel virus is now actively spreading in Syria and turkey, where temperatures already near +25C. Some specialists believe that climate shows no influence on the new coronavirus as it has spread on all continents, except Antarctica. This is just an observation as there is still no scientific base to explain the nature of the new coronavirus.",0

The Fed says it will name companies that participate in its lending programs.The Federal Reserve will disclose the names of companies that benefit from its lending programs, it announced Thursday, a sign that the central bank is willing to provide the kind of transparency lawmakers have been urging.
The central bank will release the names and details of participants in each of its programs, the amount borrowed and interest rate charged, and overall costs, revenues and fees, it said. The Fed will publish program reports on its website at least every 30 days.
Congress has handed the Treasury Department $454 billion to back up Fed lending facilities, which either make loans or buy bonds to keep credit flowing in key market segments. With that layer of taxpayer insurance, the Fed has announced programs that are meant to help midsize businesses, state governments and large corporations.
But the backing came with some reporting requirements, as do the Fed’s emergency lending authorities in general: Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin must regularly report to Congress on the programs, for instance. It was unclear how detailed those explanations would be until Thursday’s release laid out the parameters.
“The Federal Reserve is committed to transparency and accountability,” Mr. Powell said in the release.
L Brands fires back after the buyer of Victoria’s Secret tries to pull out.
L Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret, shot back at the private equity firm that has been trying to terminate its acquisition of the retail chain
The effort on the part of the firm, Sycamore Partners, to end the deal because of the coronavirus outbreak is “invalid” and “pure gamesmanship” after it failed to renegotiate the price, L Brands said in a Delaware court filing on Thursday
The dispute has become the most prominent example of a buyer trying to back out of a deal because of the pandemic.
Sycamore said on Wednesday that L Brands had violated terms of its February transaction agreement and that a “material adverse effect” occurred because of the pandemic, allowing it to terminate the deal to buy 55 percent of Victoria’s Secret for about $525 million.
L Brands said on Thursday that when the deal was negotiated, “the world was already well aware of the existence of Covid-19, and the parties agreed that Sycamore would bear the risk of any adverse impacts stemming from such a pandemic.” The definition of a “material adverse effect” explicitly carved out impacts from pandemics, the company said.
The company called Sycamore’s stance “pure gamesmanship.” Sycamore sent L Brands a letter on April 13 saying that it wanted to renegotiate the purchase price and other terms of the deal because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to L Brands. When the company declined to renegotiate — because the agreement “expressly allocates the risk of pandemics to Sycamore” — the private equity firm sent a termination notice and filed the subsequent lawsuit, according to the filing.
Early May is too soon to reopen auto factories, the U.A.W. says.
The United Automobile Workers union said on Thursday that it was opposed to companies restarting auto production next month, saying it is not yet safe for its members to return to work.
“At this point in time, the U.A.W. does not believe the scientific data is conclusive that it is safe to have our members back in the workplace,” the union’s president, Rory Gamble, said in a statement. “We have not done enough testing to really understand the threat our members face.”
The union represents more than 400,000 workers and is an influential voice in the labor movement and manufacturing industry.
Mr. Gamble added the union supported an extension of the stay-at-home order in effect in Michigan. That order, by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, expires on April 30 but she has said she expected an extension was warranted.
“We strongly suggest to our companies that an early May date is too soon and too risky to our members, their families, and their communities,” Mr. Gamble said.
General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler have been discussing with the union when and how they will reopen plants.
The union’s statement comes as some nonunion automakers announce plans to resume production in southern states that have not been hit as hard by the virus as Michigan, where 3,000 people, including more than two dozen U.A.W. members, have died from the coronavirus.
Earlier on Thursday, Toyota Motor said it was preparing to restart operations at its U.S. plants on May 4. Volkswagen has said it would begin phasing in production at its U.S. plant on May 3.
Stocks lose steam but oil prices continue their rebound.
Stocks on Wall Street ended virtually unchanged on Thursday as an early rally, fueled by a surge in oil prices, faded.
The S&P 500, which rose as much as 1.6 percent earlier in the day, was flat by the close of trading. The ups and downs came as investors absorbed more grim economic news: Millions more workers claimed unemployment benefits in the United States and data from Europe highlighted the heavy toll of shutdowns to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Investors have been shrugging off such data in recent weeks, as the shock of the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic fades and they begin to expect an eventual recovery.
Governments have started to discuss measures to return to normal. Businesses in Europe and the United States have begun to detail their plans to reopen businesses. Major airlines have already aggressively advertised the precautions they are taking to lure back passengers, from fogging cabins with disinfectant to restricting food service to blocking out middle seats.
Lawmakers in Washington continue to advance measures to support the economy. The House will vote on Thursday on a $484 billion coronavirus package that would revive a depleted loan program for distressed small businesses and provide funds for hospitals and testing.
More than 26 million people have filed jobless claims in the last five weeks.
The grim economic toll from the coronavirus pandemic jumped on Thursday when the government reported another 4.4 million people filed new unemployment claims last week, bringing the five-week total to more than 26 million.
The report is likely to intensify the debate over when to lift restrictions that have helped fight the virus’s spread but placed the economy in a stranglehold, reports Patricia Cohen of The Times.
“At all levels, it’s eye-watering numbers,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. But as large as the figures have been, they do not capture the full extent of layoffs — or the cascade of economic troubles that they have set in motion.
Problems responding to the waves of jobless claims now will affect the shape of the recovery when the pandemic eases, Mr. Slok said. Laid-off workers need money quickly to pay for rent, groceries and credit card bills. If they cannot do so, he said, the hole that the larger economy has fallen into “gets deeper and deeper, and more difficult to crawl out of.”
The Treasury warns big companies not to take small-business loans.
The Trump administration warned big companies on Thursday that they must prove they were in need of emergency small business loans to keep their operations running and had no other option to get financing or repay the funds.
The new guidance from the Treasury Department came amid an uproar over bigger companies taking loans through the Paycheck Protection Program while smaller businesses have been left out.
The Treasury Department updated its “Frequently Asked Questions” page about the P.P.P. to urge “large companies with adequate sources of liquidity” to think twice before applying for loans backed by the Small Business Administration.
The S.B.A.’s $349 billion fund to support these loans ran out last week and is expected to be replenished with another $310 billion this week. Backlash over the program has been escalating after some big restaurant chains took out multiple $10 million loans for their subsidiaries.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned businesses that they would be investigated and could face penalties if they improperly accept small-business money. He has urged such businesses to return those funds. The guidance released on Thursday said borrowers that repaid loans in full by May 7, 2020, would be deemed by the S.B.A. to have made their certifications in good faith, leaving them in good standing with the government.
At least five companies have already given back the funds: Shake Shack, Sweetgreen, Kura Sushi USA, ItWorks! and the owner of Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse, have all disclosed that they have returned the P.P.P. loans.
Another publicly traded company, Wave Life Sciences USA, announced on Thursday it was returning $7.2 million in a loan from JPMorgan Chase, one of the banks that handled aid applications using a two-tiered system that heavily favored larger companies and wealthy clients over the smallest businesses.
“We made this decision after the S.B.A. issued new guidance that states, in effect, that public companies are not appropriate recipients of these loans,” ” a spokeswoman for the company, Alicia Suter, said in an email.
Entrepreneurs are learning in real time how to adapt to survive.
A Memphis food tour company joined with local restaurants to offer a special meal and video tour to locals. The owners of a Detroit bar and scent shop froze cocktail mixers into ice cubes so patrons could just add liquor at home to mix the perfect drink. A laundry service for Airbnb rentals in Minneapolis started a curbside business for people stuck inside their homes.
Small-businesses owners across the country are looking for ways to survive the coronavirus pandemic, even as they fill out paperwork for federal stimulus funds that they no longer believe they can count on. They are adapting their business models and innovating products so that they, and their employees, can get back to work.
“Small businesses are really great at staying nimble,” said Laura Huang, associate professor at Harvard Business School and author of “Edge: Turning Adversity Into Advantage.” The ones that succeed, she said, “understand that even though they are looking to do new, innovative things, they need to grow where they are planted.”
That means that small-business owners should not completely change what they do but find new ways to deliver their product, dust off old ideas, experiment with existing strengths, search for new customers or change their story.
Macy’s plans its Fourth of July fireworks show, but the expense is questioned.
When Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said on Wednesday that Macy’s and its chief executive, Jeff Gennette, were committed to holding its annual Fourth of July fireworks display, he called the gesture “generous” and “really patriotic.”
But critics questioned the expense at a time when most of Macy’s 123,000 employees have been furloughed. The retailer, which also owns Bloomingdales and Bluemercury, is facing intense financial pressure with the temporary closure of its stores.
“Macy’s should not be spending millions on fireworks displays while its own work force is out of work,” Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said in a statement on Thursday. The company should be spending the money on health care coverage for employees instead, he added.
Macy’s does not disclose the cost of the show, though Mr. de Blasio suggested in a briefing on Thursday that this year’s display might be more modest. Macy’s said the display dates to 1976 and that this year’s show “will be a celebration of the strength and resilience of New York City and will honor frontline workers across America.”
Mr. de Blasio defended the plans to proceed with the pyrotechnics show. “I don’t think it’s an either-or,” he said. “Macy’s put aside the resources to provide this celebration.” The cost of the show, he added, was “small compared to the needs of working people.”

581,581,711,"If you reopen for business early and somebody dies, don’t expect your insurance company to bail you out","Gov. J.B. Pritzker has repeatedly said he’s delegating enforcement of his stay-at-home order to local governments.

That stance has frustrated some folks who want him to get tougher with violators (although he’d undoubtedly risk making martyrs out of them if he did crack down hard). And the governor’s position seems to have emboldened some local officials to defy the governor’s executive order and open up their economies on their own.

But when local governments refuse to enforce the governor’s order, it appears that trial lawyers might step in and insurance companies might take a walk.

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

A growing number of Downstate sheriffs, state’s attorneys and other officials have declared they won’t be enforcing the governor’s stay-at-home order. The Woodford County state’s attorney has said he won’t prosecute violators, as has the White County state’s attorney. Johnson County’s sheriff is one of several who’ve said he also wouldn’t arrest anyone for violating the order.

East Peoria’s mayor has gone beyond even that, officially allowing the “opening” of several businesses in his city on May 1 that were ordered closed by the governor’s executive order, including hair salons, spas, gyms and indoor recreational facilities. On May 15, bars and restaurants will be allowed to reopen at 50 percent capacity, and churches and theaters also will be allowed to reopen on that date.

But the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association has a message for those renegade municipalities and businesses preparing to throw open their doors: Watch out for lawsuits.

“The risk of opening early outweighs the benefit of limiting liability not only for the municipality but also for any employer who follows the guidelines of the municipality,” said ITLA President Antonio Romanucci in a written statement. “The prudent course would be to stay closed for another 25 days and limit any further potential spread which could lead to litigation.”

I asked Pritzker at a recent press conference what he thought of the warning from trial lawyers.

“Well, I was a businessman before I became governor,” Pritzker replied, “and I have to tell you that I would not want to defy the executive order because I believe that I would be taking on liability if I did that.”

Those towns and businesses could find themselves without insurance coverage should something go wrong.

Kevin Martin, executive director of the Illinois Insurance Association, told me that insurance policies are “not going to cover intentional acts.” In other words, if a business intentionally reopens in violation of the executive order and somebody injures himself at the establishment or contracts the virus, insurance coverage won’t be a given. The same may go for municipalities that openly violate the executive order.

The Illinois Department of Insurance also chimed in, saying via press release: “If businesses reopen contrary to public health guidelines and the state’s executive orders, there is risk that an insurer could find reason within the policy language to deny COVID-19 related claims.”

I asked Pritzker at that same press about insurance issues.

“It would not surprise me if insurance companies are found to not be required to cover you when you are defying essentially state law or a state executive order,” he replied.

The Illinois Retail Merchants Association has taken the position from the beginning that the executive order is “the best course of action for both consumers and employees,” the group’s president, Rob Karr, said via written statement. “We have also advised retailers of both the liability, insurance and other legal issues that may arise from not following the state’s guidance.”

The Illinois Restaurant Association also released a statement saying the group has encouraged its members to follow the executive order. The Illinois Licensed Beverage Association, which represents tavern owners, said it “does not advise” its members to violate the executive order.

The governor has pointed out several times that many of the businesses that are defiantly reopening have state licenses. Your local barber or salon owner needs a state license to open and operate. Cosmetologists, electrologists, massage therapists and nail technicians are just some of the others who must have state licenses. Restaurants and taverns are under state oversight and can be closed down by local public health departments in situations just like this.

The bottom line is, if you don’t fear the virus, then you might want to start to fear being wiped out by lawsuits not covered by insurance or losing your license.

1294,1297,1729,Genetic Code of Every Lifeform Under Attack by World Elite,"An arrogant scientific elite has divorced themselves from common sense, natural law, and the rest of the human species in their quest for full spectrum domination.

The very genetic code of the planet’s biosphere is being overwritten; The ultimate goal being the ability to manipulate, patent and program at will the biological processes of all life.

Tom Knight, professor at MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Lab, said in 2007 that “The genetic code is 3.6 billion years old. It’s time for a rewrite.”

In 2013, Fidelity Investments published a video outlining the future of synthetic biology:

Thinking Big: Synthetic Biology, Fidelity from Tian Hughes on Vimeo.

Synthetic biology, according to a 2005 European Commission paper is “…the engineering of biology… the synthesis of complex, biologically based (or inspired) systems which display functions that do not exist in nature.”

Geneticist Craig Venter is a pioneer in the field of synthetic biology. In 2010 the media hailed his team’s success in creating “the first self-replicating species we’ve had on the planet whose parent is a computer.”

Venter and Google teamed up at secretive gathering that hosted Jeffery Epstein

The Edge Billionaire dinner – comparable to the secretive Bilderberg group – is an annual gathering of tech elites that has hosted Jeffery Epstein, Craig Venter, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Bill Joy and many others.

Physicist Freeman Dyson described the individuals leading this group as having god-like power to create entirely new species on earth in a “New Age of Wonder”. He describes them as:

“…a new generation of artists, writing genomes as fluently as Blake and Byron wrote verses, might create an abundance of new flowers and fruit and trees and birds to enrich the ecology of our planet.”

As revealed in the 2005 book “The Google Story“, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin met with Craig Venter – credited with creating synthetic life – at the Edge Billionaires meeting.

Also present were representatives from the U.S. State Department, Bill Gates, Anne Wojcicki, Bill Joy and dozens of other tech company CEO’s and scientists. The authors write, “Not long after the dinner in California, Brin and Page teamed up with Venter. The biologist gained access to Google’s immense computing power and personnel.”

Coronavirus vaccine to use synthetic DNA created by computers

The New York Times reported on the developing vaccine technology in 2015. As the Times reported, animal tests on the synthetic DNA vaccine “are essentially re-engineering the animals to resist disease.”

Now, research-backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will use genetic code created by computers in a potential coronavirus vaccine.

As reported, the Gates-funded synthetic biologists believe that they can “do better” than nature with self-assembling nanoparticles that will be injected into your body:

“With all due respect to nature, synthetic biologists believe they can do better. Using computers, they are designing new, self-assembling protein nanoparticles studded with viral proteins, called antigens: these porcupine-like particles would be the guts of a vaccine.”

541,541,663,"""This is all worth it"": Andre Dawson, MLB Hall of Famer and funeral home owner, helps families dealing with coronavirus","From the major leagues to the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, former big league star Andre ""The Hawk"" Dawson is now in a different field. While he serves as a special assistant to the Chicago Cubs, he is also a mortician and helping South Floridians through their most difficult time, CBS Miami reports.

Dawson owns a well-known funeral home in Richmond Heights, a Miami-Dade community full of tradition and history.

The homegrown baseball hero, who slugged his way into the Hall of Fame, is now in a world far removed from his previous life.

""As an athlete, you are kind of used to the crowd roaring and cheers and this is completely the opposite,"" he told CBS Miami's sports anchor Jim Berry.

A year ago, Dawson was just a passive investor at the Paradise Memorial Funeral Home, but when the business fell into his lap, he and his family took it on. Little he did know that months later, his industry would be coping with a global pandemic.

""It's like a nightmare, and the sad thing is you can't be too careful,"" he said.

His wife of 42 years, Vanessa, is the office manager, while his uncle runs the day to day operation. The staff totals 23, and they're wearing masks and going through a lot of hand sanitizer.

South Florida has not been overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases like New York, but Dawson said its effects here are still hugely challenging. Uncertainties about the virus lingering in those who have died has his staff taking extra precautions.

Social distancing and limiting services to 10 people can take a heavy emotional toll.

""The sad emotional side of me comes out a lot especially if its someone that you know, but trust me I do have a lot of moments but at the end of the day after doing two or three services you are pretty beat up,"" he explained.

Andre Dawson seen at the Paradise Memorial Funeral Home. CBS Miami

When Dawson's former baseball buddies heard about his new endeavor, they were stunned.

""I got a lot funny stares. Jim Rice looked at me and said 'You're doing what?' I got a similar stare from Rickey Henderson. It's funny, the first thing I throw back at them is 'Here, I have a business card for you,'"" he said laughing.

It has been an adjustment, but the once mighty slugger is learning how to make a difference in a different way.

""All I want to do at this point is to be able to continue to serve and if I can be confident in that regard then this is all worth it,"" Dawson explained.

The Miami native ended his 21-year major league career in 1996. He was an eight-time All-Star despite knee injuries that have led to more than a dozen operations. He's best remembered for his 49-homer season with the Chicago Cubs in 1987, when he was voted the National League Most Valuable Player.

Dawson was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2010.",1
1131,1131,1372,"In the world’s fifth-most-populous country, distance learning is a single television channel","Now, for millions of Pakistani schoolchildren, that single channel is their only access to education. And even that channel isn’t available to everyone.

Pakistan already struggles to keep millions of children in school, and as partial shutdowns continue, educators warn enrollments could drop further. Some private-school students were given study plans and extra coursework, but most Pakistani children — those who attend public government schools — were sent home with no further guidance.

“They said, ‘Keep them busy,’ but they didn’t provide us an outline to study, anything,” said Kainat Nisar, a 24-year-old university student who suddenly found herself in charge of the education of five nieces and nephews between the ages of 4 and 14.

The children watch the government channel for their allotted hour, but Nisar, as one of the most educated people in her family, is left to keep everyone engaged for the rest of the day. A typical day has the younger children outside on the roof hunched over workbooks while the older children share use of the family’s only laptop in a back room.





""You are teaching your children on your own; you're on your own,"" she said.

Pakistan has some of the world’s worst education indicators. More than 40 percent of Pakistan’s school-age students don’t attend school, the second-highest rate in the world. And even for those who do attend school, literacy rates suggest many are not learning. Fewer than 20 percent of Pakistani third-graders can read and comprehend a short passage.

Now, educators, experts and officials fear the months-long closure of schools in Pakistan with minimal distance learning is set to exacerbate the problem.

The national Pakistani curriculum is taught in Urdu and English — the country’s official languages. But most Pakistani children grow up speaking a regional language at home and struggle to absorb information in the classroom. Lessons largely consist of rote memorization with teachers reciting the content of textbooks to classes of 30 to 40 children. The students chant back what the teachers just said.





""It's almost like we think kids are USB sticks, and we are just downloading this information onto them and that will make them educated,"" said Nadia Naviwala, a global fellow at the Wilson Center and an expert on the Pakistani education system. She warns Pakistan's education crisis is preventing the country from advancing economically and undercuts efforts to battle extremism.

These larger problems in Pakistan's education system, Naviwala says, are reflected in the government television channel created during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Teleschool channel is uneven in its quality. Some programming is incomprehensible and fast-paced, while other broadcasts are better than the content children get in the government school system, according to education experts.



In one recently broadcast English lesson for kindergartners about the letter “u,” a young female voice narrates an animated story about a village of huts destroyed by a mudslide after a greedy man cut down all the trees. As the story is told, the words “hut,” “mud” and “cut” flashed on the screen.



But during another broadcast, a second-grade science lesson on the eyesight of owls delved into how unique proteins in the birds’ eyes sense different light wavelengths, subject matter far beyond the comprehension level of a second-grader.

Pakistan’s education minister, Shafqat Mahmood, acknowledges problems with the content. “We know it’s not perfect,” he said, but he explained his ministry was left scrambling after the shutdown was announced. The country had never had an educational television channel before, and because of the low rates of Internet access in the country, setting up online lessons with video conferencing and interactive lectures would have been impossible. About 36 percent of Pakistani households have broadband Internet access, according to government figures, and according to the World Bank 15.5 percent of the population used the Internet in 2016.

“We believe it has been very successful,” Mahmood said of the Teleschool channel. He said the feedback he has seen from parents and teachers has been overwhelmingly positive. But, he said, “it doesn’t replace the classroom.”





Mahmood also acknowledged that the channel wasn’t reaching Pakistan’s poorest families and said his ministry is trying to develop educational radio programing.

Pakistan’s schools will be closed through the rest of the school year, officials announced this week, despite the easing of other lockdown restrictions. Coronavirus infections, meanwhile, are steadily increasing. As of Monday, the Health Ministry had recorded nearly 42,000 infections. More than 900 had died.

Imtiaz Ahmed, a headmaster at a school in Pakistan’s northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said hardly any of her students have been able to see the program. Like most government school students in Pakistan, the children at Ahmed’s school are mostly from poor families of farmers or day laborers, and they cannot afford a television set.

Once schools reopen, Ahmed said, it will take months to bring students back to the level they were at when the lockdown began. And she said she expects fewer students to return as more families put their children to work for additional income.





Partial coronavirus lockdowns in Pakistan have put millions out of work and are estimated to have pushed up to 10 million Pakistanis into poverty, according to government estimates.

Saima Ali, a middle-class housewife, said her family’s finances have taken a hit from the lockdown. Ali went to government schools as a child but insists on sending her children to private schools, where she believes they receive a better education.

“It’s expensive, it’s a lot for us, but we must by hook or by crook,” she said of scraping together the fee payments.

“We have a saying in Urdu: The most important wealth you are giving to your children is education.”

1079,1079,1287,LAUSD superintendent says budget cuts could be ‘just as real a threat’ as coronavirus,"Los Angeles Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner warned Monday, May, 18, that state budget cuts could harm students, while the district is bracing for its own budget shortfalls due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The harm children are facing is just as real a threat to them as is the coronavirus,” he said in a prepared weekly address.

Beutner added that state and federal governments “jumped into action” to support patients who became ill and pour funding to make sure hospitals were adequately funded and staffed.

“We are looking at the same challenge in public education and we need the same full-throated response to the education crisis which looms ahead,” he said. “Governments have established virus task forces and job task forces. Where’s the education task force?”

The announcement comes days after Gov. Gavin Newsom said that decline of state revenues could force the state to cut funding for K-12 by nearly 10%. A recent revenue and funding forest released earlier this month from the governor’s office found that K-12 school districts could see funding cut by more than $18 billion.

Beutner didn’t disclose how cuts would impact the district’s operations but said details would be available in the coming days and weeks.

The pandemic is taking a toll on many families who have been struggling financially, he said on Monday.

Before the outbreak hit, forcing schools to close about two months ago, 70% of families reported a household income of less than $50,000 and 35% less than $25,000, Beutner said. Recently, 57% of families reported that one or more individuals in their household have lost their job after the pandemic broke out.

“Most families were struggling to get by before this crisis and for more than half of them, their situation has gotten worse,” he said.

Nearly every LAUSD student is now participating in online learning, school officials announced last week, but “a login on a computer doesn’t necessarily mean a student is engaged and learning,” Beutner said. These days, teachers are being trained with the focus on shifting to keeping students engaged in their studies, he added.

The level of engagement in classrooms and schools varies a great deal, he said, as teachers from “all schools will continue to reach out to students and encourage them to participate, just as they would in a classroom.”

Beutner also discussed the efforts to assist students who are learning English. The district has nearly 100,000 English learners and their families have received materials with conversation skills, literacy and math in both English and Spanish, similar to those used in classrooms.

On Monday, the district released the results of a survey to study the needs of nearly 12,000 families in East Los Angeles completed in early May, which found that roughly 75% felt schools and the district are doing a good job handling the crisis, officials said. About 80% of the families are receiving help three or more times a week from schools, including homework and health care and food.

Beutner pointed out that the biggest challenge for families was access to the internet and technology, with 50% lacking reliable internet and 25% a device.",1

Broadway shut down in March for what it thought would be a month, but with New York at the epicenter of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and with guidelines from the Center for Disease Control and the New York governor Andrew Cuomo, theaters will now remain shut until at least June 7th. The announcement was made on Wednesday morning by the Broadway League, an organization of theater owners and producers.

Broadway brought in $1.8 billion in ticket sales and close to 15 million audience members last season. It's New York's top tourist attraction, bringing in more people than all of the tri-state area's professional sports teams combined. And many ancillary businesses have been affected, too – hotels, taxi cabs, restaurants.

When performances were suspended, 16 shows were scheduled to open before the Tony Awards deadline in late April – two of them, a revival of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and Hangmen subsequently announced they were closing. The musical Beetlejuice will not reopen in June, may move to another theater later. Three shows at non-profit venues will postpone their productions to next season.

The pandemic's toll has rocked the community with personal losses, among them Tony Award-winning playwright Terrence McNally, character actor Mark Blum, and composer Adam Schlesinger.",1
1011,1011,1206,Bittersweet e-ceremony for UIC grad: ‘I didn’t really get to say goodbye’,"Edith Mendez watched a slideshow of photos from her college experience, read a Spanish quote she handpicked to thank her family and listened to a speech delivered by her college dean Saturday.

But the 2020 graduate from the University of Illinois at Chicago did so from the backyard of her family’s Berwyn home, not on campus with the momentous ceremony she’d always imagined.

“It was a little bit strange — maybe, in some ways, disappointing,” said Mendez, a first-generation college grad. “Just because I didn’t get to walk across the stage.”

She joined more than 5,000 UIC students — and tens of thousands more at other Illinois schools — left with no choice but to celebrate their graduation with an online ceremony in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

UIC still plans to hold an in-person commencement for their 2020 class sometime later this year, but with the state’s stay-at-home order banning large gatherings, the virtual stand-in will have to do for now.

And for Mendez, like millions of students nationwide, the COVID-19 shutdown has disrupted far more than just graduation.

Mendez and two of her classmates were the first to come out of UIC’s revamped Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art Education program, which resumed in 2017 after a long hiatus.

The culmination of Mendez’s UIC experience — a student-teaching tenure at Benito Juarez High School in Pilsen, where she mentored sophomores and seniors in art classes — was nonetheless cut short by the pandemic.

“I didn’t really get to say goodbye,” she said. “I knew things that they were going through, but we also got to learn from each other. I feel like maybe they could see themselves in me, just because there’s not a lot of teachers of color or women of color that teach in Chicago Public Schools.”

Mendez entered UIC eyeing a career in medicine, but an elective art class she opened her eyes to a field that fulfilled her creativity, her desire to create positive change and her struggles with her own identity.

“I wanted to... give younger students the opportunity of taking art courses that I didn’t have when I was in high school,” she said. “It’s really therapeutic to do so, [because] art is a way to figure out or reflect on your experiences and find your identity and go back to your roots. Because when you are a first-generation [college student] and a Latina, it’s hard to connect when you have these two sides of yourself.”

Her career passion as an art teacher cemented, Mendez has already been accepted into Chicago Public Schools’ early offer program, which guarantees her a job somewhere within the district next school year.

She’s still applying for specific positions, ranging from elementary to high-school level, while planning out how to earn a master’s degree in Latino Studies at some point down the road.

While her final months as an undergraduate might not have gone as planned, Mendez says she finds positives even in that inconvenience.

First, experiencing online classes as a student could help her teach them in the future — perhaps from the get-go, with no guarantee on when in-person classes will be able to resume anywhere in the state as the pandemic unfolds.

And second, “if this wasn’t happening, my dad is constantly working, so he probably wouldn’t have been able to make it [to my graduation],” she said. “But because of this virus happening, he was able to be here, and friends and family were able to congratulate me.”

Mendez is also going to order a cap and gown soon, despite knowing she might not ever get to wear them onstage.

Because those tangible symbols, as thousands of other 2020 college graduates are discovering, are sometimes the only things making the accomplishment feel real these days.

“This all feels surreal because it’s not in-person and it’s not in the traditional way, but it’ll be really exciting,” Mendez said. “That’s finally when it’s going to hit me that I graduated.”",1
368,368,460,"COVID-19 has made Chicago’s affordable housing crisis worse, and the feds must step in","COVID-19 has rocked the city’s housing market. Job loss is leading many of our friends and neighbors to miss rent, which in turn makes the buildings they call home vulnerable to foreclosure when landlords are unable to pay their own expenses.

The numbers are stark. Affordable housing providers in Chicago recently surveyed by the Department of Housing reported decreases in rent collection as high as 61 percent over the last few weeks. It is the same sad story across the country. The National Multifamily Housing Council, a multifamily apartment building industry group, polled its membership and found a 60% increase in nonpayment through April 12 compared to the same period a year ago.

Opinion

Even before the crisis, 63 percent of African American renters and 56 percent of Latino renters in Chicago were cost-burdened, as compared to 42 percent of white renters. Let’s face it: Long before the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed, Chicago was a city with profound racial and economic segregation and insufficient affordable housing.

COVID-19 is not creating inequities, it is simply reflecting those we already had.

The road to recovery has to involve us supporting each other as never before. If you are one of the fortunate who has not lost income during this time, one of the best ways to support those who have is to pay your rent.

Landlords have a better shot at being flexible with those who cannot pay if those who can, do. A wave of evictions or foreclosures is not in anyone’s interest.

The city is doing all that it can to address the crisis. Before March ended, the housing department made 2,000 grants for housing assistance available and received 83,000 applications in just five days. (Donate to the next round at https://givetogethernow.org/; under Location Preference, select Chicago.)

Last week, we introduced new grants to our affordable housing landlords to make up for rental shortfalls and remove red tape to refinance city loans in weeks instead of months. The grants should greatly help stabilize more than 3,400 units of affordable housing, keeping thousands of men, women and children safe and secure in their homes.

As the mayor says, we are all in this together. But the “all” must include the federal government, too.

The federal CARES Act provided a strong start for many issues, but only a sliver was dedicated to housing. To meet the scale of the crisis, we simply need more federal resources to keep low- and moderate-income Chicagoans housed. We’re talking $100 billion nationally for direct rental assistance alone, according to the National Low-Income Housing Coalition.

Here’s what else Chicago’s renters and owners need from Washington’s next COVID-19 relief package:

Emergency rental assistance and long-term sustained support for programs that produce and preserve affordable housing . Short-term direct rental assistance would meet the needs of tenants who don’t already have a subsidy like a Housing Choice Voucher and can help landlords to stay afloat.

. Short-term direct rental assistance would meet the needs of tenants who don’t already have a subsidy like a Housing Choice Voucher and can help landlords to stay afloat. Funding for local governments that can backfill revenue losses . This will allow us to better resource response efforts such as our Housing Assistance Fund and Emergency Relief for Affordable Multifamily Properties Program.

. This will allow us to better resource response efforts such as our Housing Assistance Fund and Emergency Relief for Affordable Multifamily Properties Program. Relief for city-supported affordable housing developments. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program is by far the largest program the city has to create and preserve new affordable rental homes. It is crucial during this unprecedented crisis that LIHTC buildings in the pipeline receive extensions on key deadlines to ensure this program continues serving Chicago’s low-income renters.

Those are some of the many things we need from the federal government. These precious resources, however, must be dispersed in a manner that accounts for COVID-19’s disproportionate impact on black and brown communities.

History tells us to expect an inequitable impact: During the housing crisis that began in 2008, black and Latino households were nearly 50 percent more likely to face foreclosure than white households, and the racial wealth gap widened. Just as we’ve seen with disproportionate levels of COVID-19 infection and death among black people, we are concerned about and working to solve for the housing impacts of the virus on communities of color.

Our housing solutions must and will address the needs of both tenants and landlords. We are committed to avoiding both widespread evictions and foreclosures. We know that by providing or maintaining stable, affordable housing, we are investing in the people who live there, who by having a quality, affordable place to call home, can be freed up to focus on the other parts of their lives that matter: Family, work, school and, of course, health.

1240,1241,1610,"Insomnia, depression: a study has examined the possible impact of Covid-19 on patients' mental health","The results of the meta-analysis suggest that certain disorders such as anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder may persist for months or even years in patients severely affected by Covid-19.

In order to understand the long-term effects of severe Covid-19 infection, U.S. researchers have reviewed symptoms in people affected by other forms of coronavirus, notably SARS and MERS.

The meta-analysis of 65 peer reviewed studies and seven pre-prints on the observed psychiatric consequences of more than 3,550 severe infections with SARS (2002), MERS (2012) and Covid-19. The study was limited to cases treated in hospital and therefore does not apply to patients who experienced milder symptoms or were asymptomatic.

The results of the analysis, published in The Lancet Psychiatry suggest that whereas most patients will not suffer immediate mental health effects, certain complications like depression, anxiety, fatigue, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could emerge in the months and years that follow hospitalization.

Two studies that systematically assessed common symptoms in a panel of 129 patients hospitalized with SARS and MERS noted various mental disorders such as confusion (28%), low mood (32%), anxiety (35%), impaired memory (34%) and insomnia (42%).

Twelve studies of patients with Covid-19 painted a similar picture with evidence of delirium in 26 out of 40 intensive-care patients, agitation in 40 out of 58 intensive-care patients, and altered consciousness in 17 out of 82 patients who subsequently died.

Six other studies of patients with SARS and MERS also found frequent reports of low mood (11%), insomnia (12%), anxiety (12%), irritability (13%), memory impairment (19%), fatigue (19%), and frequent recall of traumatic memories (30%) over a follow-up period ranging from 6 weeks to 39 months.

""While there is little evidence to suggest that common mental illnesses beyond short-term delirium are a feature of COVID-19 infection, clinicians should monitor for the possibility that common mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, fatigue, and PTSD could arise in the weeks and months following recovery from severe infection, as has been seen with SARS and MERS"", points out Dr. Jonathan Rogers, a researcher from University College London, UK, and a co-author of the study.",1
992,992,1185,‘Everyone has a story’: How will world remember pandemic?,"Artist Obi Uwakwe was driving through Chicago’s empty streets, camera on his lap to document life during COVID-19, when he saw something that made him stop: a casket being carried out of a church while a few mourners stood by, their faces covered.

The 43-year-old raised his camera and took a photograph. Later, it would become one of the images Uwakwe used to create paintings inspired by the pandemic.

“To see maybe six people there, everyone wearing a mask,” he said, “it brought everything together.”

Around the world, people like Uwakwe are creating photographs, paintings, emails, journals and social media posts that will shape how the world remembers the coronavirus pandemic for years and centuries to come. Museums and historical societies already are collecting materials, often with help from people accustomed to capturing and sharing even the most mundane moments around them.

The result, historians say, will be a collective memory more personal than perhaps any other moment in history.

“Everyone is touched by this. Everyone has a story,” said Erika Holst, curator of history at the Illinois State Museum, one of hundreds across the U.S. gathering pieces of a generational treasure trove. Collecting the items in real time allows historians to nudge people for the stories behind them — a luxury rarely available, Holst said.

“Usually as historians, we get a lot of numbers — the number of people who died, the number who got sick, the economic effect,” she said. “It doesn’t always capture what it felt like.”

The enormity of the event is forcing historians to balance capturing ephemeral moments and those that will transcend time.

At the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, a task force is looking into how to gather and preserve objects, images and documents that could become part of permanent collections. But the pandemic itself is challenging the group’s ability to collect because the museum is closed, so curators are asking potential donors to hold onto items.

“We are trying to take the long view on this, so (we are) focusing now most on objects that are ephemeral, things that might disappear, that might get thrown away or just used up,” said Benjamin Filene, the museum’s associate director of curatorial affairs.

Unlike during other national crises, people have a camera in their pocket at all times, documenting whatever they deem relevant and sharing it on social media, from the cloth mask they sew and the sourdough bread they baked to the cheer for front-line workers and the Zoom meeting of school students.

But not every quilt made or puzzle finished can tell the story of what happened in the U.S. in the spring of 2020.

“There is sort of this overwhelming mass of information, but that information is not necessarily being captured in a way that’s going to be preserved,” Filene said. “And there’s also the possibility that it is so fragmentary that how much will it translate to somebody else five years from now or 25 or 50 years from now? We don’t just need a thing; we want the story that goes with the thing.”

The National Museum of African American History and Culture has been working with doctors, nurses and other health workers who have offered to donate personal protective equipment. Senior curator for history William Pretzer said cultural organizations nowadays do “rapid-response collecting” and no longer wait until materials are considered memorabilia.

“You collected stuff because you had historical perspective on that event. You collected the Civil War 20 years after the Civil War. You collected World War II experience in the 1950s,” Pretzer said. “You didn’t do it immediately. Beginning in some ways with 9/11, however, it became clear that rapid-response collecting, collecting on the spot meant that you got the original evidence.”

Pretzer said the museum wants to “go behind the statistics” showing the virus has disproportionately affected people of color. and explain the reasons for the disparity and what can be done about it in the future.

“In other words, it’s not a race or color or ethnicity that determines this disproportionate impact. It’s the underlying conditions,” Pretzer said. “What’s the economic role? What kinds of jobs are available in that community? What kind of access to health care do people have? What type of access to healthy foods have they had? What access to transportation? What is education like in those communities?”

Technology is helping historians collect material and tell stories as well. The Historic New Orleans Collection, a museum and publishing house, is using technology known as a “spider” to crawl the web and collect information about how the pandemic is affecting the hard-hit city. Among its finds: the city’s cellphone alert system’s webpage.

The Maryland Historical Society is sharing posts on its blog and on social media using its own hashtags, #LettersFromtheHomeFrontMD and #CollectingInQuarantineMD. An April 16 entry includes a letter from a woman identified as Lauren from Darlington, Maryland, explaining her fears of contracting COVID-19 while at work. She said she works for the U.S. Postal Service, while her husband is an electrical foreman.

“I have two young children at home and I can not afford to stay home and only receive two-thirds of my pay,” she wrote. “We are both exposed to the world ... My mother can not get this disease, it may kill her.”

Heather Voelz of Taylorville, Illinois, submitted a photo to the Illinois State Museum of her kids on Easter. But she said most of what she’s recording are things that “wouldn’t mean much to anyone but us.” Voelz and two of her children, ages 3 and 5, are keeping a kids’ journal she found online, and Voelz plans to put the pages in their baby books.

“I know they don’t fully grasp what is happening,” she said. “But they will someday.”

Zofia Oles, 18, of suburban Chicago started taking photos for her school photography class but kept at it to remember her senior year. Some photos show Oles dancing alone in her room, she and her brother going to the store and neighbors gathering — at a distance — in a parking lot.

“I want to have a memory of how it looked so when I am able to be with my friends again, I can appreciate how it was,” she said.

Uwakwe said recent weeks remind him of the days after 9/11, when streets were quiet and there was a collective sense of grieving, helping and appreciation for people on the front lines.

Uwakwe didn’t walk around with a camera back then. In the years since, he’s thought about those missed images. It’s what ultimately moved him to get in his car and capture what’s happening.

“The more I sat, I thought: ‘I don’t want to regret not doing it again.’”",1
399,399,495,"Rolling out contact tracing in Illinois a daunting task, but essential, expert says","Roughly a quarter of the coronavirus tests conducted at the Howard Brown Health clinic in Hyde Park have been coming back positive, amounting to about 20 new confirmed cases a day.

The initial diagnosis is just the start of the staff’s work, though. What comes next is the arduous task of tracking down every person that patient may have encountered, a time-tested public health practice known commonly as contact tracing.

Though local and state officials have said that process is key to slowing the pandemic and reopening the state, a large-scale initiative hasn’t been announced to address the daunting task of tracking down every person who has come into contact with the growing number of COVID-19 patients. On Wednesday, 2,253 new cases were reported across Illinois as the total number of cases eclipsed 50,000.

One day per patient

Dr. John Schneider, a University of Chicago faculty member who serves as the Howard Brown clinic’s medical director, explained that a single staff member requires around a full day to call an infected person’s entire chain of direct and indirect contacts. That web of connections typically consists of roughly 10 people, most of whom haven’t even been around the original patient.

While roughly two-thirds of those contacts wind up testing positive, Schneider said close contacts living with an infected person are even more likely to come down with the disease. Facing a deadly virus that can spread insidiously to carriers who don’t show symptoms, contact tracers must move swiftly to interrupt the chain of infection.

“There’s definitely cases where we’ve observed that if we had intervened a couple days earlier, we could’ve prevented transmission events,” said Schneider, whose team consists of 15 contact tracers and three “data people.”

Schneider believes the state has been slow to launch a larger effort and holds that getting a contact tracing system in place is vital for responding to the current outbreak and a possible resurgence in a few months.

“I really think it’s about doing the best we can now, knowing it’s not going to be perfect,” he said.

State system a work in progress, gov says

Officials haven’t said how many people will be needed to ramp up contact tracing statewide.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker told reporters on Tuesday that state officials were still trying to “spin up” a system, which he said is “a very large endeavor” that requires both hiring and technology. And Illinois Department of Public Health Director Ngozi Ezike alluded to a large-scale deployment of contact tracers in an interview last week with the New Yorker, saying thousands would likely be needed across the state.

In addition to traditional community outreach, Chicago Public Health Commissioner Allison Arwady said Tuesday that an app rolled out by the city earlier this week to offer coronavirus-related assistance and allow Chicagoans to pre-register for a vaccine could ultimately be used for contact tracing.

“That kind of technology would be a total game-changer here,” Lightfoot said about similar technology being developed in Germany.

“We’ve learned that when people get multiple folks calling them, they’re more likely to engage or to be contacted”

Limited tracing taking place already

For now, public health workers in Chicago and Cook County are already conducting limited contact tracing of COVID-19 patients.

The county was employing 29 contact tracers as of April 16, including four dedicated to congregate settings like nursing homes and the Cook County Jail. Meanwhile, the city’s current contact tracing efforts are also focused on those types of facilities.

As a result, investigators from both departments sometimes collect the same information, which is then routed to a statewide system state officials use to track cases. According to Schneider, it can actually be useful to have multiple tracers reaching out to a single person.

“We’ve learned that when people get multiple folks calling them, they’re more likely to engage or to be contacted,” he said. “You don’t wanna be completely inefficient but some overlap is okay.”

Private firm recruiting in Chicago

In recent days, a Washington, D.C.-based recruitment firm that launched just a week ago has started hiring contact tracers in Chicago and other major cities. Contrace Public Health Corps ultimately hopes to recruit 20,000 workers nationwide by May 15, the company’s founder and CEO Steve Waters said in an interview.

“Contact tracing is the largest US civilian mobilization since World War II,” the company says in its job postings, which advertise pay of $17-22 an hour.

Waters said the newly-minted company has not been contracted by any government agencies in Illinois. Instead, applicants from Chicago will likely be hired by a local employment agency or nonprofit, who he said will prioritize the hiring of residents with “an understanding of local geography and culture.”

“Our model is based on the premise that as we are not operating as a traditional recruiting company,” said Waters. “We can help local and state agencies and nonprofits stand up contact tracing efforts, at scale, much more quickly and at a much, much lower cost than traditional recruiters.”",1

Gabriel Sherman, an opinion writer for the left-wing magazine Vanity Fair, was apparently confused about what conservatives find to be unseemly about the Obama administration’s unmasking of American citizens, including retired Gen. Michael Flynn, in December 2016. Flynn, who was tapped to be President Donald Trump’s first national security adviser, was surveilled in conversation with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

“Serious questions for Trumpers,” Sherman wrote on Twitter last Friday. “What is the scandal of unmasking an American official caught on an intercept discussing US sanctions policy with Ambassador of a hostile foreign country that had just launched a massive cyber attack on our election?”

Uhh, he was the incoming National Security Advisor & a 3-star general. He’s SUPPOSED to discuss sanctions policy. That’s his job.

1119,1119,1360,Coronavirus: Trump predicts vaccine delivery by end of 2020. Experts say that’s not likely,"The Trump administration on Friday formally announced a hyper-ambitious plan to develop and manufacture hundreds of millions of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine that would be widely available by the end of this year.

The reason behind the plan’s optimism was unveiled on Monday morning: The leading candidate vaccine, developed by the drug maker Moderna in conjunction with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center, appeared to generate an immune response in eight healthy volunteers.

Additionally, the product appeared to protect mice who were exposed to the virus.

The company plans to launch a large clinical trial in July aimed at showing whether the vaccine works. It is ramping up its capacity to manufacture the vaccine, it said Monday.

But it represents just the beginning of a long process to bring a vaccine to market. Vaccine studies require broad testing in thousands of patients followed over many months, and hope can fizzle out if there are new issues with safety or efficacy. And once proven, distribution must wait for factory construction, mass production of millions of doses and final federal approval.

What do other experts say about the timetable of a “game-changing” vaccine or drug that will let us return to normal life, enjoying parties, restaurants, music festivals, football games and graduations?

Many scientists say they doubt we’ll meet Trump’s goal of hundreds of millions of coronavirus vaccine doses by January. While we may have data showing that a candidate vaccine is effective by then, it will take longer to build the capacity for manufacturing and distribution of so many doses, experts say.

It’s possible, say some, that we’ll first have an effective drug or therapeutic antibodies to treat patients who are already infected with the COVID-19 virus. While such a treatment would not end the pandemic, it would blunt the impact.

Here is a collection of expert opinions we’ve gathered from the federal hearings, press briefings and university academic webinars:

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID):

“If we are successful” with the NIAID-Moderna vaccine, “we hope to know that in the late fall and early winter (of 2020).

“Even at the top speed we’re going, we don’t see a vaccine playing in the ability of individuals to get back to school this term.”

“Will we know it’s effective? I think extremely unlikely for the span of a year to 18 months. And given other technical problems in producing vaccines, that may even take a lot longer.

768,768,937,Business trips could become a thing of the past as the pandemic pushes CEOs to ask themselves what warrants a flight and what could've been a Zoom call,"Many executives are reevaluating business travel amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Many said the pandemic has led them to believe that in-person meetings are often unnecessary, and that traveling for business may not be as valuable — or essential — as they once thought.

As Paul Hudson, CEO of Sanofi, said, ""the one-business meeting trip will disappear.""

This feature is part of a series based on conversations with more than 200 CEOs on how business will be transformed by the coronavirus. To read more, click here.

As the global pandemic upends business, CEOs are figuring out what practices they need to keep — and what they can lose for good.

From scaling back on their real estate to rethinking remote work, mandated social distancing has forced leaders to confront the idea that what used to be the professional norm may no longer be the best way to continue. That includes taking a hard look at business trips and questioning when they're really worth taking.

As the pandemic shut down airlines and hotels and brought travel to a halt, the $1 trillion business travel sector took a massive hit. According to data compiled by Tourism Economics for the US Travel Association, travel spending was down by $119 billion for the period between March 1 and April 25, a decrease of more than 80% over the same period in 2019.

About 30% of total travel spending in 2019 was for business travel, accounting for about $334.2 billion in spending and about 2.5 million jobs, according to the US Travel Association. Business travel is typically also the biggest revenue generator for the hotel industry, and conventions and other meetings being pushed out into 2021 is a growing concern.

Travel industry experts have been predicting that after the outbreak eases in the US, vacations will return well before business travel does.

Business Insider recently asked more than 200 chief executive officers at some of the world's largest companies how business will be transformed by the coronavirus.

Many of these leaders noted that the pandemic has already caused their stance on in-person meetings to evolve.

""I think we're seeing that you can do a lot [via] video conferencing, and that's going to have a big impact on how often people travel for work,"" Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told Business Insider. ""Business travel isn't going to go away, but I think it's going to look very different in the future.""

""It may be the case that we can do less travel, but we can get more done, that we're more thoughtful about what the live meetings need to be,"" said Doug Ingram, CEO of Sarepta Therapeutics, a medical research company based in Massachusetts.

The end of the one-meeting business trip

Donna Imperato, CEO of PR and communications firm BCW Global, told Business Insider that the company recently completed a pitch that was drawn out over the course of months and involved employees traveling all over the world.

In retrospect and in regards to all the travel involved, she said, ""I don't think it was necessary to spend all that time to get the same outcome.""

Imperato isn't the only leader rethinking how prominent a role business travel needs to play in future operations.

The coronavirus pandemic has forced a shift to remote work that had already been in progress for several years. And, businesses that have implemented the infrastructure for remote work in response to the pandemic may realize that that setup works for them just fine.

Some executives speaking with Business Insider said they were surprised to find that going remote has actually made their workforce more productive, perhaps because they are doing less networking and person-to-person interacting.

""Paradoxically, the crisis has significantly improved the way we operate and made us more efficient with no lunches, dinners, or traveling,"" Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman of S4 Capital, a media company based in London, said. Sorrell is also the founder and former CEO of advertising giant WPP.

This shift in mindset will likely mean that many business leaders will take a more discerning approach when scheduling trips.

""Undoubtedly, the experiments we're all going through by using video conferencing, FaceTime facilities for quick meetings a quick exchange of ideas has certainly changed significantly our behavior,"" Thomas Flohr, CEO of private jet company VistaJet, told Business Insider. ""So in the short-term, I don't see travel [is going] to rebound anywhere in the near future.""

Paul Hudson, CEO of Sanofi, a pharmaceutical company that's headquartered in New Jersey and employs more than 100,000 people globally, said that ""the one-business meeting trip will disappear.""

""People will be more comfortable with virtual meeting solutions and travel will become something we do when it's absolutely necessary,"" he said.

Embracing alternatives — for now

Several leaders said it would take a viable vaccine for this to change.

""We'll continue to rely on technology and new thinking to perform our jobs,"" Dave Burwick, CEO of The Boston Beer Company, said. ""And at least until there's a vaccine, we expect to be traveling less on planes and not interacting with large groups of people.""

Until then, business leaders are embracing virtual meetings and conferences.

""There will still be times when the industry will need to come together in person. I look forward to the day when there is a vaccine so that will be possible,"" Terry Duffy, chairman and CEO of CME Group, said. ""In the meantime, we will need to be more creative, rethinking old ways of doing business and developing new ones that fit this new reality.""

Business travel will look different once it resumes

Hilton is developing new hygiene protocols, including placing a seal on doors to indicate that no one has entered since it was last cleaned. Hilton

Hotels and other hospitality branches catering to business travelers will likely have to implement additional hygiene measures as they start to welcome people back.

55% of the business travelers surveyed by Engagious said that visible medical screenings like temperature checks and swabs before entering a venue would have a positive impact on their willingness to resume visits to places like airports, hotels, and restaurants.

Hospitality businesses are gearing up for this shift in mentality, rolling out enhanced cleaning protocols and social distancing measures. As Chris Nassetta, president and CEO of Hilton, told Business Insider, hotels will endure as gathering points for a variety of events, including business meetings, ""though likely with some adjustments.""

""As wedding receptions, business meetings, and social gatherings return, the way our Team Members deliver food and beverage service will also change,"" Nassetta said. ""We can expect the demand for buffet and communal dining to change, and the opportunity for personalized, one-on-one service to increase.""

Ultimately, it's likely to be years before business travel returns to the levels set in 2019, if it ever does.

Gary Kelly, CEO of Southwest Airlines, said in an April earnings call that business travel could take more than five years to return to levels from last year. Business travel makes up about a third of Southwest's passenger traffic, he said.

""Based on history, in a recessionary environment, it is a long recovery period for businesses. And it's intuitive to me on why that would be,"" he said. ""This one feels like it could be worse.""",1
